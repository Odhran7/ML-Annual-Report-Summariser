segments principal products produced and markets and marketing 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials the steel mills segment is nucor’s largest segment representing 66 of the company’s sales to external customers in the year ended december 31 2021 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces we also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad the markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions

we are a leading domestic provider for most of the products we supply and in many cases eg structural steel merchant bar steel steel joist and deck preengineered metal buildings steel piling cold finish bar steel steel electrical conduit pipe and insulated metal panels we are the leading supplier 

steel mills segment 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces sheet steel hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks hpiling and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar and engineered special bar quality “sbq” nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces “eafs” continuous casting and automated rolling mills the steel mills segment also includes nucor’s equity method investments in numit llc “numit” and nucorjfe steel mexico s de rl de cv “nucorjfe” as well as international trading and distribution companies that buy and sell steel manufactured by the company and other steel producers 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada and mexico the steel mills segment sold approximately 20296000 tons to outside customers in 2021 

 

the following chart shows our outside steel shipments by end market 

in 2021 79 of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers the remaining 21 of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our steel products segment 



steel produced by our bar mills has a wide usage serving end markets including the agricultural automotive construction energy furniture machinery metal building railroad recreational equipment shipbuilding heavy truck and trailer market segments considering nucor’s production capabilities and the mix of bar products generally produced and marketed the capacity of the bar mills is estimated at approximately 9560000 tons per year

reinforcing and merchant bar steel are sold in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders our sbq products are hotrolled to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors

in december 2021 nucor announced that it expects to build a rebar micro mill at a tobedetermined location in the south atlantic region



nucor produces hotrolled cold rolled and galvanized sheet steel to customers’ specifications contract sales within the steel mills segment are most notable in our sheet operations as it is common for contract sales to account for the majority of sheet sales in a given year  we estimate that greater than 80  of our sheet steel sales in 2021 were to contract customers the balance of our sheet steel sales w ere made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale the amount of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors including our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons in a manner to meet our customers’ requirements while considering the expected profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts are noncancellable agreements that generally incorporate monthly or quarterly price adjustments reflecting changes in the current marketbased indices andor raw material cost  and typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months  

in january 2022 nucor announced that it expects to build a new stateoftheart sheet mill in west virginia in february 2022 nucor completed its acquisition of a majority ownership position in california steel industries inc “csi” a flatrolled steel converter based in fontana california expanding the reach of nucor’s sheet mill group to the west coast of the united states



nucor also owns a steel beam mill in berkeley county south carolina considering nucor’s production capabilities and the mix of structural products generally produced and marketed the capacity of the two structural mills is estimated at approximately 3250000 tons per year both mills use a special continuous casting method that produces a beam blank closer in shape to that of the finished beam than traditional methods 

structural steel products come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders



plate steel products come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders



nucor owns a 50 economic and voting interest in numit a company that owns 100 of the equity interest in steel technologies llc “steel technologies” an operator of 30 strategically located sheet processing facilities in the united states canada and mexico steel technologies transforms flatrolled steel into products that meet the exact specifications for customers in a wide range of industries including the automotive agricultural and consumer goods markets 

nucor owns a 50 economic and voting interest in nucorjfe a joint venture with jfe steel corporation “jfe” of japan that operates a galvanized sheet steel plant in central mexico that is expected to suppl y the country’s automotive market with an a nnual capacity of approximately 400000 tons

in august 2021 nucor acquired hannibal industries inc hannibal a leading national provider of steel racking solutions total annual ntp capacity is approximately 1500000 tons in march 2021 nucor announced that it expects to build a new tube mill on the site of its kentucky sheet mill 



reinforcing products are essential to concrete construction they supply tensile strength as well as additional compressive strength and protect the concrete from cracking in many markets harris sells reinforcing products on an installed basis ie harris fabricates the reinforcing products for a specific application and performs the installation harris operates nearly 70 fabrication facilities across the united states and canada with each facility serving a local market total annual rebar fabrication capacity is approximately 1686000 tons



sales of steel joists joist girders and steel decking are dependent on the nonresidential building construction market the majority of steel joists joist girders and steel decking are used extensively as part of the roof and floor structural support systems in warehouses data centers manufacturing buildings retail stores shopping centers schools hospitals  and to a lesser extent in multistory buildings and apartments we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not sell these finished steel products out of inventory  the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are  in most cases  competitively bid against other suppliers 





nucor’s cold finished facilities are among the most modern in the world producing cold finished bars for the most demanding applications ncf obtains most of its steel from the nucor bar mills ensuring consistent quality and supply through all market conditions these facilities produce colddrawn turned ground and polished steel bars that are used extensively for shafting and other precision machined applications ncf produces rounds hexagons flats and squares in carbon alloy and leaded steels these bars are purchased by the appliance automotive construction equipment electric motor farm machinery and fluid power industries as well as by service centers ncf bars are used in tens of thousands of products a few examples include anchor bolts hydraulic cylinders and shafting for air conditioner compressors ceiling fan motors garage door openers electric motors and lawn mowers

nucor owns a fully integrated precision castings company corporacion pok sa de cv “pok” with a facility in guadalajara mexico pok produces complex castings and precision machined products used by the oil and gas mining and sugar processing industries pok produces a wide array of precision castings using steel bronze iron and specialty exotic alloys pok complements ncf’s businesses and nucor’s cold finish facility in monterrey



the sizes of the buildings that can be produced range from less than 1000 square feet to more than 1000000 square feet complete metal building packages can be customized and combined with other materials such as glass wood and masonry to produce costeffective energy efficient aesthetically pleasing buildings designed to the customers’ special requirements the buildings are sold primarily through independent builder distribution networks in order to provide fasttrack customized solutions for building owners the primary markets served are commercial industrial and institutional buildings including distribution centers data centers automobile dealerships retail centers schools and manufacturing facilities





nucor produces mesh at nucor steel connecticut inc and nucor wire products utah nucor also produces mesh in canada at the harris operations of laurel steel the combined annual production capacity of the steel mesh facilities is approximately 128000 tons

our grating business manufactures and fabricates steel and aluminum bar grating products at facilities located in north america and serves the new construction and maintenancerelated markets the annual production capacity for our grating business is approximately 46500 tons

raw materials segment 

in the raw materials segment nucor produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas drilling operations nucor’s raw materials investments are focused on creating an advantage for its steelmaking operations through a global information network and a multipronged and flexible approach to metallics supply



djj is the leading broker of ferrous scrap in north america and is a global trader of scrap metal pig iron and other metallics in addition to sourcing steel scrap for nucor’s mills djj is a global trader of ferroalloys and nonferrous metals djj’s logistics team owns and operates one of the largest independent fleets of railcars in the united states dedicated to the movement of scrap and steel and also offers railcar leasing and railcar fleet management services these activities have strategic value to nucor as the leading and most diversified north american steel producer

our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are eaf steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills  and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2021  approximately 9  of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitute tons we brokered and processed were sold to external customers we consumed the balance in our steel mills 



nucor’s dri production and brokering capabilities provide our steel mills flexibility to quickly adjust their metallic input mix to changing market conditions enabling them to maintain cost competitiveness in the oftenvolatile ferrous scrap market with the potential for highquality scrap to become scarcer coupled with the risk of thirdparty supplier disruptions nucor’s dri facilities provide a greater degree of certainty over metallics supply to its steel mills



nucor’s access to a longterm lowcost supply of natural gas is a component in the execution of nucor’s raw material strategy natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to partially offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our dri plant in louisiana and our steel mills in the united states



customers and markets 

we have a diverse customer base and are not dependent on any single customer our largest single customer in 2021 represented approximately 5 of sales and consistently pays within terms our steel mills use a significant portion of the products of the raw materials segment 

we believe that nonresidential construction is the largest enduse market that we serve products from our steel mills and steel products segment are used in a variety of nonresidential construction applications eg commercial industrial infrastructure

in recent years we have come to see our eafbased steelmaking method with its lower greenhouse gas “ghg” intensity when compared with blast furnace technology as a competitive advantage for reasons beyond its flexible highly variable cost base many of our customers are expressing greater concern for the ghg emissions in their supply chains and are prioritizing sourcing their steel requirements from eafbased steelmakers for incorporation into their projects and products 

we have developed branded product lines to leverage this and other advantages conferred by our specialized capabilities 



 



we have also invested in people and processes to organize more of our commercial activities around large customers and enduse markets eg automotive construction wind energy and solar energy we have developed dedicated teams who are tasked with developing relationships and educating decision makers in these sectors we believe this has resulted in earlier and more thoughtful consideration being given to steelbased solutions from nucor and a better appreciation for some our unique products and capabilities such as aeos tm and econiq tm 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to expand our product portfolio to include more valueadded steel mill products and capabilities improve our cost structure enhance our operational flexibility and increase our exposure to markets with attractive growth prospects such as datacenters warehouses and renewable energy these investments totaled approximately 634 billion over the last three years with approximately 75 going to capital expenditures and the remainder going to acquisitions we believe that these investments will help us deliver profitable longterm growth further we believe shifting our product mix to a greater proportion of valueadded products will make us less susceptible to being negatively impacted by imports

nucor has several new capital projects and an acquisition of majority ownership position a joint venture in the steel mills segment that support our expansion of valueadded product offerings and costreduction strategies 





 



 

 



 

the new mill will be equipped to produce 84inch sheet products and among other features will include a 76inch tandem cold mill and two galvanizing lines galvanizing capabilities will include an advanced highend automotive line with full inspection capabilities as well as a constructiongrade line in addition to its advanced capabilities and strategic location the new greenfield mill’s product mix is anticipated to have a significantly lower ghg intensity than competitors who have historically supplied the region  

 



 

these mills are referred to as micro mills because they have a smaller operational footprint than our older rebar mills as well as less productive capacity – typically about 400000 tons per year this makes them suitable for smaller regional markets and enables to us serve these markets with a logistics cost advantage relative to competitors operating from further away micro mills also have a lower environmental footprint due to their smaller size and the fact that their plant design does not typically include a natural gas fired reheat furnace that is common in many steel mills 

 



 

our acquisition of csi expands the reach of nucor’s sheet mill group to the west coast of the united states and increases our exposure to more valueadded sheet steel csi’s product capabilities include hot rolled pickled  oiled cold rolled and galvanized sheet steels as well as electric resistance welded erw pipe its annual capacity is estimated at more than 2000000 tons 

during 2021 nucor made two strategic acquisitions in the steel products segment 



 

 



capital allocation strategy 

the significant developments in nucor’s business in recent years have largely been driven by our capital allocation strategy our highest capital allocation priority is to invest in our business for profitable longterm growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing existing operations greenfield expansions and acquisitions

our second priority is to return capital to our stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases nucor has paid 147 billion in dividends to its stockholders during the past three years that dividend payout represents 13 of cash flows from operations during that threeyear period the company repurchased 328 billion of its common stock in 2021 395 million in 2020 and 2985 million in 2019 

we intend to return at least 40 of our net income to stockholders over time via a combination of both cash dividends and share repurchases over the past three years we have returned approximately 58 of our net income in this manner at december 31 2021 the company had approximately 385 billion available for share repurchases under the currently authorized share repurchase program

we intend to execute on our capital allocation strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet with relatively low financial leverage as measured in terms of net debt to total capital as well as ample liquidity at yearend 2021 our net debt to total capital was approximately 14 and we had cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and cash equivalents on hand of 276 billion at the end of 2021 nucor had the strongest credit ratings in the north american steel sector baa1a with stable outlooks at both moody’s and standard  poor’s

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service

in our steel mills segment our eaf steel mills face many different forms of competition including domestic integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other domestic eaf steel mills steel imports and alternative materials large domestic integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs eafbased steel producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with large integrated steel producers eafbased steel producers also typically emit fewer ghgs per ton of steel produced than integrated steel producers

global steel production overcapacity continues to be an ongoing risk to nucor and the entire steel industry the organisation for economic cooperation and development  “ oecd ”  estimates that global steel production overcapacity is currently approximately 500 000000 tons which is down slightly from previous years however additional capacity continues to come online and china’s steel production the largest steel producing country is still near record levels in 2021 china’s steel production was 113 billion tons compared to the record amount of 116 billion tons the previous year 

circumvention of trade duties also continues to pose a risk besides producing record amounts of steel in its own country china is investing heavily in steel production in neighboring countries which is one way it tries to avoid being subject to trade duties stateowned chinese steel companies are involved in new steel capacity projects in indonesia the philippines and malaysia the south east asia iron and steel institute seaisi has estimated that by 2026 there will be significant production overcapacity in the region noting it will take 20 years for demand to catch up with the projected capacity levels 

strong trade enforcement has led to a structural change in the us steel market the section 232 steel tariffs and successful trade cases have been effective in keeping unfairly traded imports out of the us market in november 2021 the us government reached an agreement with europe to end the section 232 imports on steel from the european union and replace them with a tariff rate quota the us government is also negotiating potential deals to end the tariffs with the united kingdom and japan imports of finished steel in 2021 were up approximately 48 from 2020 levels and accounted for approximately 22 of us market share 

at the end of 2021 congress passed a significant infrastructure spending bill the bill will result in an estimated 4 million to 6 million tons of additional steel demand per year and contains strong buy america requirements to ensure domestically produced steel is used to rebuild us infrastructure approximately 50 of nucor products are shipped into the construction market and nucor’s lower carbon footprint is expected to provide an additional advantage as states and localities look to rebuild infrastructure in a sustainable manner

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are often other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives can become more attractive to our customers

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 379 billion and 258 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from other nucor businesses nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 812 billion and 266 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in backlogs for the steel products segment is due to several businesses within the steel products segment having record backlog volume and pricing at december 31 2021 the majority of these orders are expected to be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not meaningful because the vast majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally

sources and availability of raw materials 

an ample supply of highquality scrap and scrap substitutes is critical to support nucor’s ability to produce highquality steel nucor’s raw materials segment safely produces sources trades and transports steelmaking raw materials nucor’s raw materials investments are focused on creating an advantage for our steelmaking operations through a global information network and a multipronged and flexible approach to metallics supply

scrap and scrap substitutes are the most significant element in the total cost of steel production the average cost of scrap and scrap substitutes used in our steel mills segment increased 62 from 290 per gross ton used in 2020 to 469 per gross ton used in 2021 on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce one ton of steel depending on the market conditions at the time a raw material surcharge or variable steel pricing mechanism may be implemented to assist nucor in maintaining operating margins and in meeting our customer commitments during periods of rapidly changing scrap and scrap substitute costs 

for the past decade nucor has focused on securing access to lowcost raw material inputs as they are the company’s largest expense we believe nucor’s broad balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallic inputs our investment in dri production facilities and scrap yards as well as our access to international raw materials markets provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw material costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil such as ukraine russia and brazil we believe the continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production as well as in the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj gives us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus helps us mitigate the risk of significant fluctuations in the availability and costs of critical inputs

djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed primarily from overseas sources including russia ukraine and brazil we received over 2800000 gross tons of pig iron in 2021 our dri plants in trinidad and louisiana have respective annual production capacities of approximately 2000000 and 2500000 metric tons the primary raw material for our dri facilities is pelletized iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills energy consumption and costs 

steel manufacturing is considered an energyintensive trade exposed industry as a result we continuously strive to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient in addition we proactively engage with suppliers regulators and other energy industry participants to ensure the continued availability of reliable lowcost sources of energy in various forms

our steel mills utilize eafs for 100 of their steel production with approximately 50 of their total energy consumed as electricity the total energy consumed by nucor also includes natural gas oxygen and carbon raw material inputs for the scrap melting process electricity is the primary energy source with natural gas combustion serving as the fuel for reheat furnaces and other preheating operations our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas 

the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today by many factors including changes in supply and demand the regulatory environment and pipelinetransmission infrastructure

we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges as well as our owned natural gas drilling operations in addition to the currently producing wells in the piceance basin nucor owns leasehold interests in natural gas properties in the south piceance basin in the western slope of colorado to support nucor’s operating wells and potential future well developments on these properties nucor has entered into longterm agreements directly with thirdparty gathering and processing service providers natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to partially offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our dri plant in louisiana and by our steel mills in the united states nucor has full discretion on its participation in all future drilling capital investments  

we closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption we engage with policymakers to provide technical information that can inform policy decisions and avoid unintended adverse consequences of legislative and regulatory actions we believe that a thoughtful approach to domestic energy policy can help ensure that steel and steel products manufactured in the united states remain competitive in the increasingly global marketplace 

reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

ghg emissions by the energy sector have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years as more people become concerned that these emissions are a significant contributor to climate change this has led to increasing support for and investment in low or zero carbon energy generation technologies such as solar wind and nuclear as a result the development of these technologies has accelerated and in many cases they are now more cost competitive with traditional fossil fuelbased power generation we believe that this ongoing diversification of power generation technologies is fundamentally positive but without careful planning and investment there is some risk to the reliability of the domestic power grid as this transition continues in particular legacy fossil fuelbased assets will remain essential for some time to come and the us transmission grid is broadly in need of substantial upgrades to take full advantage of these newer more intermittent power sources we are also optimistic about the related demand for our products as transmission grid upgrades are executed and newer power generation assets are developed using steel

in july 2021 we announced a commitment to lower the ghg emissions intensity from our steel mill operations by 35 in 2030 measured against a 2015 baseline  the year the paris climate agreement was adopted as a result nucor’s ghg intensity in 2030 is expected to be 77 less than today’s global average we expect to achieve these goals with a multipronged approach that includes utilization of renewable energy carbon substitutes more efficient operations and carbon sequestration

in 2020 and 2021 we entered into three virtual power purchase agreements “vppas” under each vppas we have agreed to purchase for a fixed price a portion of the output of both solar and wind renewable power projects being developed in the united states the vppas will be settled financially on a monthly basis we have undertaken these initiatives to support the ongoing transition of the us power grid to a greater reliance on renewable power as part of these arrangements we will also receive renewable energy credits “recs” commensurate with the power we purchase these recs can be applied against a portion of our ghg emissions enabling us to receive credit for reducing them the pay fixed received floating nature of this arrangement also offsets a portion of our exposure to higher prices for electricity over the life of the contract we are evaluating and considering similar transactions one vppa started delivering recs to us in june 2021 and the other two vppas may be delayed as a result of supply chain disruptions and permitting delays and interconnection delays

government and environmental regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations the most significant of which are intended to protect our teammates and the environment due to the nature of the steel industry we are subject to substantial regulations related to safety in the workplace in addition to the requirements of the state and local governments of the communities in which we operate we must comply with federal health and safety regulations the most significant of which are enforced by the occupational safety and health administration “osha” because safety and safety compliance is one of our primary values its effect on our capital expenditures earnings and competitive position is not estimable

nucor operates a robust and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of each individual teammate as well as management being responsible for environmental performance all of nucor’s steel mills that have been in operation for over five years are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification requires nucor’s steel mills to implement an environmental management system with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use 

the principal federal environmental laws that regulate our business include the clean air act the “caa” which regulates air emissions the clean water act the “cwa” which regulates water withdrawals and discharges the resource conservation and recovery act the “rcra” which addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “cercla” which governs releases of hazardous substances and remediation of contaminated sites our operations are also subject to state and local environmental laws and regulations 

as it relates to air emission rates eafs are the most efficient and cleanest steel making process commercially available today in comparison to blast furnaces emissions of sulfur oxides from eafs are approximately 14 of the amount emitted from blast furnaces eafs emit less than 1 of the particulate emissions compared to blast furnace operations importantly eaf emissions of ghgs per ton of steel average less than half of the rates typically generated by blast furnaces operating eafs instead of blast furnaces is a proven air quality improvement strategy in addition each of our steel mills operates air pollution control devices baghouses to collect and capture particulate emissions “eaf dust” from the steel making process we strive to maintain compliance with all applicable caa requirements

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal generates particulate matter emissions that includes contaminants such as paint zinc lead chrome and other metals initially the particulate matter captured and collected is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals the eaf dust is recycled to recover these metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it collects to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor believes it is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but it is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both the cercla and the rcra

in addition to recycling eaf dust nucor mills beneficially reuse steel slag in road materials as a granular base embankments engineered fill highway shoulders and hot mix asphalt pavement the physical chemical mechanical and thermal properties of steel slag provide a vital resource for construction companies and activities we take considerable pride in our recycling efforts 

not only does the rcra establish standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes the rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling and storage of most wastes periodically past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are discovered when the us environmental protection agency determine s these off  site properties are contaminated  nucor quickly evaluates such claims and  if nucor is determined to be responsible  we do our part to remediate our share of such issues nucor believes all identified liabilities under the rcra are either currently being resolved or have been fully resolved 

because nucor has historically implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under the cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor regularly evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under the rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor believes that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them

to protect water resources the cwa regulates water withdrawals and discharges when applicable nucor maintains water withdrawal and discharge permits at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments if the facility discharges into publicly owned treatment works

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2021 and 2022 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year

human capital resources 

culture organization and compensation

we consider our teammates the most important part of nucor and believe that our culture – and the encouragement that we provide to our teammates to “grow the core expand beyond and live our culture” – provides us with a competitive advantage our culture’s key principles are safety first trust open communications teamwork community stewardship and results 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure that allows our teammates to make quick decisions and innovate our organization is also highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their teams with nearly 29000 teammates fewer than 200 work in our principal executive offices in charlotte north carolina by empowering our teammates our goal is to foster an entrepreneurial mindset along with a strong sense of personal responsibility and a culture of accountability this empowerment is reinforced by our compensation policies see “pay for performance” discussion in our teammates compensation training  development section below to drive results and contribute to our success 

teammate input is essential for us to maintain our culture of empowering teammates to make operational decisions aside from our practice of everyday open communication we periodically ask our teammates to formally provide feedback beginning in 1986 we have asked our teammates to complete a comprehensive survey in order to gather feedback on a range of topics  including matters relating to the effectiveness of our culture we view the survey as an important tool we use to continually improve our company and ensure our teammates remain engaged and satisfied this survey is conducted every three years the last of which was conducted in 2019  in the most recent survey 90 of the responses were favorable in the category of “satisfaction  commitment  ” the overall percentage of negative responses in the most recent survey has dropped by 25 percentage points since the survey began in 1986 the next survey will be conducted in the summer of 2022 teammates of certain previously acquired businesses – most notably harris which a ccount ed for approximately 15  of our workforce as of december 31 202 1 – complete a comparable survey that ha s also shown a n improving trend over time 

safety diversity equity  inclusion

one of nucor’s core values is our teammates’ wellbeing and safety and it is our goal to become the safest steel company in the world our foremost responsibility is to work safely which requires our teammates to identify unsafe conditions and activities and mitigate these hazards we will continue working to eliminate exposures that can lead to injury and encourage our teammates to share their ideas for safety improvement two key metrics nucor uses to measure safety are the injuryillness rate and days away restricted and transfer “dart” case rate 

nucor calculates the annual injuryillness rate by dividing the number of workrelated injuries and illnesses by the total number of hours worked by all nucor teammates in a given year and then multiplying the resulting percentage by 200000 the equivalent of 100 fulltime employees working 40 hours per week 50 weeks per year in 2021 we achieved an annual injuryillness rate of 104 which marks the safest year in the company’s history this marks an improvement over our annual injuryillness rate of 110 in 2020 which was the company’s previous record

nucor uses the dart case rate to assess and manage the risk of serious injury in the workplace nucor calculates the annual dart case rate by dividing the number of cases resulting in days away from work restricted work activity andor job transfers by the total number of hours worked by all nucor teammates in a given year and then multiplying the resulting percentage by 200000 the equivalent of 100 fulltime employees working 40 hours per week 50 weeks per year in 2021 we achieved an annual dart case rate of 050 059 in 2020

beginning in 1998 nucor has used the president’s safety award to recognize divisions that achieve strong records of safety performance based on objective metrics the president’s safety award has the following three levels platinum which is awarded to divisions with zero recordable illnesses or injuries gold which is awarded to divisions that have an illnessinjury rate below 06 and a dart case rate below onethird of the national average for their naics code and silver which is awarded to divisions that achieve onethird the national average on illnessinjury rate and dart case rate in 2021 16 divisions achieved the platinum level award 14 divisions achieved the gold level award and 17 divisions achieved the silver level award nucor also has 25 osha voluntary protection program sites osha’s highest level of recognition

in 2020 the company introduced the nucor president’s safety cup as a way to foster more safety benchmarking throughout the company the president’s safety cup is an additional annual award that is presented to the region that has the best safety record across all of nucor not only does this reward a facility for exceeding their individual safety goals but it encourages our teams to work with their regional teammates to share ideas and improve safety as a group the president’s safety cup trophy travels among the mills and divisions that make up the winning region 

we believe however that safety is about more than just avoiding injuries at nucor safety means making sure our teammates feel safe welcome and valued when they come to work each day we are accelerating our diversity equity and inclusion efforts with the objective of ensuring that each teammate feels a sense of belonging at nucor by creating an inclusive workplace we believe we will attract top talent and achieve greater diversity in our workforce and leadership which will make nucor a stronger company some of the initiatives focused on inclusion equity and diversity we have launched include 

 



















our teammates  compensation training  development

nucor had approximately 28800 teammates as of december 31 2021 the vast majority of our teammates are located in the united states with only a small number of teammates located outside of north america our operations are highly automated allowing us to take advantage of lower employment costs while still providing our teammates with compensation that we believe is highly competitive as compared to businesses in our industry at nucor we believe in “payforperformance” nucor teammates typically earn a significant part of their compensation based on their productivity production teammates work under group incentives that provide increased earnings for increased production this additional incentive compensation is paid weekly in most cases nucor has also historically contributed 10 of earnings before federal taxes to a profit sharing plan for the majority of teammates below the officer level we believe such compensation practices incentivize our workforce and reinforce our culture for 2021 this profit sharing contribution was the largest in our history and amounted to approximately 861 million

while nucor seeks to hire qualified and talented individuals as teammates we also believe in developing the skills of our workforce by providing educational and onthejob training in addition to safety training further nucor believes it is important for senior management to also be familiar with and have had direct experience running nucor’s mills and other operational divisions the vast majority of our teammates are not represented by labor unions and we believe our teammate turnover is low

at nucor we believe that a diversity of perspectives and background helps to facilitate the “nucor way” as we work to “grow the core expand beyond and live our culture” we also believe that recruiting and hiring the best talent available will continue to provide us with a more diverse and capable workforce 

policies

nucor has a long history of conducting our businesses in a manner consistent with high standards of social responsibility we have adopted a comprehensive human rights policy which operates in conjunction with many other nucor policies related to ethical conduct and human rights including our standards of business conduct and ethics code of ethics for senior financial professionals supplier code of conduct and policy on eliminating forced labor from our supply chain

risk factors

tableend

many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

industry specific risk factors

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

global steel production overcapacity continues to be an ongoing risk to nucor and the entire steel industry the oecd estimates that global steel production overcapacity currently approximately 500000000 tons with additional capacity expected to come online over the next few years china continues to be a significant contributor to excess steelmaking capacity producing more than 1 billion tons of steel in each of the past two years china is also investing in new steelmaking capacity in several countries in southeast asia 

during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand for steel and steel products this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements

our operations are capital intensive for the three year period ended december 31 202 1  our total capital expenditures were approximately  4 74 billion our business requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance we also recently announced substantial capital projects that we expect will increase production capacity increase the efficiency of our operations and enhance our product offerings although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds shortterm commercial paper issuance  offerings of our debt and equity securities or from borrowings under our 1 75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot guarantee that this will be the case additional acquisitions  increases in interest rates or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political regulatory and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions including physical or information systems related issues that impact the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from market fluctuations or regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

competition from other steel producers imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price quality and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel steel products and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including the cost and availability of raw materials energy technology labor transportation and capital costs currency exchange rates government subsidies of foreign steel producers and other global political and economic factors our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood increased use or availability of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products

since 2011 automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may seek to reduce the amount of steel they incorporate in their vehicles require different types or higher grades of steel products or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing their demand for steel certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015 additional shifts in demand for steel products by automobile producers could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy metals service centers appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the us economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the us economy has experienced a strong recovery from the conditions experienced at the onset of the covid19 pandemic but new variants of covid19 and the continued abatement of the covid19 pandemic labor shortages supply chain disruptions new or proposed legislation related to governmental spending inflation and increases in interest rates have impacted and will continue to impact  economic growth even with this economic recovery challenges from global production overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties both in the united states and in other regions of the world remain 

we are unable to predict with certainty the duration of current economic conditions or the magnitude and timing of changes in economic activity future economic downturns prolonged slow growth or stagnation in the economy a sectorspecific slowdown in one of our key enduse markets such as nonresidential construction or changes in inflation could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows especially in light of the capitalintensive nature of our business

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost and availability of raw materials particularly scrap steel

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our steel products the raw material required to produce dri is pelletized iron ore although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also by acquiring djj in 2008 we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states and internationally although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors as well as volatility in currency rates and political conditions for example we source a substantial amount of our scrap and scrap substitutes from countries in europe such as russia and ukraine if political conditions in those countries or their relations with the united states or each other further deteriorate or such countries were to become subject to sanctions or other restrictions or interruptions in trade with the united states it may materially affect the price and availability of scrap and scrap substitutes 

at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters war and other forms of armed conflict or political instability changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations including due to global political and economic factors changes in governmental business and consumer spending inflation increases in interest rates labor shortages and the availability and cost of transportation including as a result of the covid19 pandemic many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials or pass along increased transportation costs also if we are unable to obtain adequate costeffective and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs experience margin compressions or suffer harm to our reputation and customer relationships

our steelmaking processes our dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs the regulation of these ghgs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and  accordingly we make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates most notably the uncertainty of policies enforcement priorities legislation and regulations related to climate change mitigation strategies pose the greatest risk 

as a carbon steel producer nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if carbon policy decisions and mandates are not properly implemented carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s steel production processes furthermore nucor steel mills utilize eafs for 100 of their steel melting operations and the costs associated with the decarbonization of electricity generation is a significant concern significant new rulemaking or legislation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

environmental regulation compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position

we incur significant costs in meeting our environmental regulation compliance and remediation obligations the principal federal environmental laws include the caa which regulates air emissions the cwa which regulates water withdrawals and discharges the rcra which addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the cercla which governs releases of hazardous substances and remediation of contaminated sites our operations are also subject to state and local environmental laws and regulations capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2022 and 2023 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

in addition to the above mentioned statutes certain revisions to national air ambient quality standards could make it significantly more difficult for us to obtain construction permits and permits to expand existing operations resulting cancellations delays or unanticipated costs to these projects could negatively impact our ability to generate expected returns on our investments these regulations can also increase our cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process we may in the future incur substantially increased costs complying with such regulations particularly if federal regulatory agencies were to change their enforcement posture with respect to such regulations

emerging customer preferences for greater product transparency and less ghg intensive materials may put us at a competitive disadvantage or reduce demand for our products

numerous states including washington oregon and new york are considering establishing requirements for environmental product declarations “epds” to evaluate environmental impacts of products california has enacted the “buy clean california act” and california has established global warming potential gwp benchmarks through epds for certain materials including certain steel products currently the federal government is considering similar legislation to provide for greater product transparency nucor contracted an independent thirdparty to evaluate and publish epds for many of its products nucor’s epds extend beyond what is required under the “buy clean california act” which requires epds for four steel products the following nucor products have been evaluated and issued a corresponding epd fabricated hotrolled structural steel sections fabricated steel concrete reinforcing bar and merchant bar products steel reinforcing bar and merchant bar products fabricated steel hollow structural sections fabricated structural plate fabricated open web steel joist and joist girders and fabricated steel roof and floor deck

epd legislation has the potential to put domestic steel manufacturers at a disadvantage to foreign competitors unless standardized mechanisms are used to fully evaluate products produced by foreign steel producers

 

 

general risk factors

the covid19 pandemic as well as similar epidemics and other public health emergencies in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics epidemics and other public health emergencies such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic which spread from china to many other countries including the united states the covid19 pandemic has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations supply chain transportation networks and customers which may compress our margins or impact demand for our steel products including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments have taken or may take in the future the covid19 pandemic and governmental actions in response have adversely affected the economies of many countries and caused periodic disruption to and increased volatility in financial markets the progression of the covid19 pandemic including due to new variants of covid19 could also negatively impact our business or results of operations through the temporary closure of our operating facilities or those of our customers or suppliers

in addition the ability of our teammates and our suppliers’ and customers’ teammates to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 our customers may be directly impacted by business interruptions or weak market conditions and may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations furthermore the progression of and global response to the covid19 pandemic has caused and increased the risk of further delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects including potential delays in obtaining permits from government agencies as well as changes in the prices and availability of labor and equipment for capital projects the extent of such delays and other effects of covid19 on our capital projects certain of which are outside of our control is unknown but they could impact or delay the timing of anticipated benefits on capital projects

the extent to which covid19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and unpredictable including new variants of the virus information concerning the severity of the pandemic the adoption rate of vaccines and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate the effects of the pandemic the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of covid19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information we also utilize thirdparty service providers for certain information technology services that are important to our operations we continuously evaluate our cyber security systems and practices assess potential threats and improve our information technology networks policies and procedures to address potential vulnerabilities despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations threats from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information or personal data or reputational damage theft of assets or trade secrets or could adversely affect our ability to physically produce or transport steel resulting in lost revenues as well as delays in reporting our financial results we also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a cyber security breach including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems we may also contend with potential liability for stolen information increased cyber security protection costs litigation expense and increased insurance premiums

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes critical equipment failures acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset a portion of the losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent that any such losses are not covered by our insurance or that there are significant delays in resolving our claims with our insurance providers

we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations effectively identify and manage risks and cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses or otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions

risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations

certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states in canada mexico and in emerging markets there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in or sourcing raw materials from such markets these risks include but are not limited to unfavorable political or economic factors local labor and social issues changes in regulatory requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and inflation and complex foreign laws treaties including tax laws and the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry as well as changes in interest rates commodity prices and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations

tax increases and changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the united states nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws

nucor recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are believed to be more likely than not of being sustained we cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit challenging any of our tax positions and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any challenges if we are unsuccessful in any of these matters we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods interest fines or penalties 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks

we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations contractual obligations and other legal standards notwithstanding this we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in respect of various issues including regulatory safety environmental employment transportation intellectual property contractual importexport international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings see “item 3 legal proceedings” a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the nature of our operations means that legal compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

the us economy experienced strong growth in 2021 growing by 57 the largest annual increase since 1984 this performance was a significant improvement over 2020 when the economy shrank by 34 in response to the onset of the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic continued to have an impact on our business and operations but the impact was significantly lessened than that experienced in 2020 market demand in 2021 was very strong across most of the end markets we serve and selling prices for steel and steel products were at historically high levels operating rates at our steel mills for the full year 2021 increased to 94 as compared to 82 for the full year 2020 

 

our challenges and risks 

global steel production overcapacity continues to be an ongoing risk to nucor and the entire steel industry with the oecd estimating that global steel production overcapacity is currently approximately 500 million tons which is down slightly from previous years however additional capacity continues to come online and china’s steel production the largest steel producing country is still near record levels in 2021 china’s steel production was 113 billion tons compared to the record amount of 116 billion tons the previous year circumvention of trade duties also continues to pose a risk as countries route products through thirdparty countries to evade duties increasingly china is seeking to evade trade duties by building new steelmaking capacity in other countries with a focus on neighboring countries in southeast asia 

a major uncertainty we continue to face in our business is the price of our principal raw material ferrous scrap which is volatile and often increases or decreases rapidly in response to changes in domestic demand unanticipated events that affect the flow of scrap into scrap yards the availability of scrap substitutes currency fluctuations and changes in foreign demand for scrap in periods of rapidly increasing raw material prices in the industry which are often also associated with periods of stronger or rapidly improving steel market conditions being able to increase our prices for the products we sell quickly enough to offset increases in the prices we pay for ferrous scrap is challenging but critical to maintaining our profitability we attempt to mitigate the scrap price risk by managing scrap inventory levels at the steel mills to match the anticipated demand over the next several weeks certain scrap substitutes including pig iron have longer lead times for delivery than scrap which can make this inventory management strategy difficult to achieve continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj give us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus also helps us to mitigate this risk

during periods of stronger or rapidly improving steel market conditions we are more likely to be able to pass through to our customers relatively quickly the increased costs of ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes protecting our gross margins from significant erosion during periods of weaker or rapidly deteriorating steel market conditions weak steel demand low industry utilization rates and the impact of imports create an even more intensified competitive environment and increased pricing pressure  all of those factors to some degree impact pricing which increases the likelihood that nucor will experience lower gross margins 

although the majority of our steel sales are to spot market customers in north america who place their orders each month based on their business needs and our pricing competitiveness compared to both domestic and global producers and trading companies we also sell contract tons most notably in our sheet operations approximately 80 of our sheet sales were to contract customers in 2021 70 in 2020 with the balance being sold in the spot market at the prevailing prices at the time of sale steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant the amount of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on the overall market conditions at the time how the enduse customers see the market moving forward and the strategy that nucor management believes is appropriate to the upcoming period

nucor management considerations include maintaining an appropriate balance of spot and contract tons based on market projections and appropriately supporting our diversified customer base the percentage of tons that is placed under contract also depends on the overall market dynamics and customer negotiations in years of strengthening demand we typically see an increase in the percentage of sheet sales sold under contract as our customers have an expectation that transaction prices will rapidly rise and available capacity will quickly be sold out to mitigate this risk customers prefer to enter into contracts in order to obtain committed volumes of supply from the mills the vast majority of our contracts include a method of adjusting prices on a periodic basis to reflect changes in the market pricing for steel andor scrap market indices for steel generally trend with scrap pricing changes but during periods of steel market weakness the more intensified competitive steel market environment can cause the sales price indices to decrease resulting in reduced gross margins and profitability furthermore since the selling price adjustments are not immediate there will always be a timing difference between changes in the prices we pay for raw materials and the adjustments we make to our contract selling prices generally in periods of increasing scrap prices we typically experience a shortterm margin contraction on contract tons conversely in periods of decreasing scrap prices we typically experience a shortterm margin expansion on contract tons contract sales typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months

our strengths and opportunities

we are north america’s most diversified steel producer as a result our shortterm performance is not tied to any one market we have numerous large strategic capital projects at various stages of progress that we believe will help us further diversify our product offerings and expand the markets that we serve we expect these investments to grow our longterm earnings power by increasing our channels to market expanding our product portfolio into higher valueadded offerings that are less vulnerable to imports improving our cost structure and further building upon our market leadership positions

we believe that nucor’s raw material supply chain is another important strength our investment in dri production facilities and scrap brokerage and processing businesses provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw materials costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control reduces risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a considerable portion of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that historically have experienced greater political turmoil

our highly variable lowcost structure combined with our financial strength and liquidity ha ve allowed us to successfully navigate cyclical severely depressed steel industry market conditions in the past in such times our incentivebased pay system reduces our payroll costs both hourly and salary which helps to offset lower selling prices our payforperformance system that is closely tied to our levels of production also allows us to keep our highly experienced workforce intact and to continue operating our facilities when some of our competitors with greater fixed costs are forced to shut down some of their facilities because we use eafs to produce our steel we can easily vary our production levels to match shortterm changes in demand unlike our blast furnacebased integrated competitors we believe these strengths also provide us further opportunities to gain market share during such times 

evaluating our operating performance

we report our results of operations in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials most of the steel we produce in our mills is sold to outside customers 79 in 2021 and 80 in 2020 but a significant percentage is used internally by many of the facilities in our steel products segment 21 in 2021 and 20 in 2020

we begin measuring our performance by comparing our net sales both in total and by individual segment during a reporting period with our net sales in the corresponding period in the prior year in doing so we focus on changes in and the reasons for such changes in the two key variables that have the greatest influence on our net sales average sales price per ton during the period and total tons shipped to outside customers

we also focus on both dollar and percentage changes in gross margins which are key drivers of our profitability and the reasons for such changes there are many factors from period to period that can affect our gross margins one consistent area of focus for us is changes in “metal margins” which is the difference between the selling price of steel and the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes increases or decreases in the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes that are not offset by changes in the selling price of steel can quickly compress or expand our margins and reduce or increase our profitability

changes in marketing administrative and other expenses particularly profit sharing and other variable incentivebased payment costs can have a material effect on our results of operations for a reporting period as well these costs vary significantly from period to period as they are based upon changes in our pretax earnings and other profitability metrics that are a reflection of our payforperformance system that is closely tied to our levels of production

evaluating our financial condition

we evaluate our financial condition each reporting period by focusing primarily on the amounts of and reasons for changes in cash provided by operating activities our current ratio the turnover rate of our accounts receivable and inventories the amounts of and reasons for changes in cash used in or provided by investing activities including projected capital expenditures and financing activities and our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments position at period end we believe that our conservative financial practices have served us well in the past and are serving us well today as a result our financial position remains strong 

 

 

comparison of 2021 to 2020 

results of operations 

nucor reported consolidated net earnings of 683 billion or 2316 per diluted share in 2021 making it by far the most profitable year in the company’s history this record year more than doubled the previous record for consolidated net earnings which was 236 billion set in 2018 and more than tripled the previous record for diluted earnings per share which was 742 per diluted share that was also set in 2018 by comparison nucor reported consolidated net earnings of 7215 million or 236 per diluted share in 2020 

all three of nucor’s operating segments reported very strong profitable in 2021 the steel mills segment operated at a 94 average utilization rate in 2021 as enduse market demand remained very strong throughout the year higher volumes combined with increases in average selling prices that outpaced increases in the average cost of scrap and scrap substitutes resulted in robust metal margins and record profits for the steel mills segment in 2021 

the steel products segment also had its most profitable year in 2021 surpassing its previous record that was set in 2020 this record performance was due to the continued strong demand in nonresidential construction markets most of the businesses within the steel products segment had increased profitability in 2021 compared to 2020 with the biggest increases coming from our joist deck and tubular products businesses 

the raw materials segment also had its most profitable year in 2021 and was significantly increased from 2020 djj’s scrap brokerage and processing operations benefited from higher average selling prices and volumes our dri facilities had a strong year of profitability in 2021 particularly in the first half of the year due to rising raw material prices as the year progressed the dri facilities’ profitability waned as the cost of consumed iron ore increased and selling prices for scrap substitutes began to decrease 

the following discussion will provide greater quantitative and qualitative analysis of nucor’s performance in 2021 as compared to 2020 net sales 

net sales to external customers by segment for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were as follows in thousands

 



 

net sales for 2021 increased 81 from the prior year average sales price per ton increased 64 from 789 in 2020 to 1292 in 2021 total tons shipped to outside customers increased 11 from 25519000 tons in 2020 to 28247000 tons in 2021

in the steel mills segment sales tons for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were as follows in thousands

 



 

 

net sales for the steel mills segment increased 99 in 2021 from the prior year due to a 78 increase in the average sales price per ton from 671 in 2020 to 1195 in 2021 as well as a 12 increase in tons sold to outside customers average selling prices for our sheet bar structural and plate mills increased substantially in 2021 as compared to 2020 

outside sales tonnage for the steel products segment for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was as follows in thousands

 



 

net sales for the steel products segment increased 47 in 2021 from the prior year due to a 41 increase in the average sales price per ton from 1382 in 2020 to 1954 in 2021 as well as a 4 increase in volumes 

net sales for the raw materials segment increased 86 in 2021 from the prior year primarily due to increased average selling prices and volumes at djj’s brokerage and scrap processing operations in 2021 approximately 90 of outside sales for the raw materials segment were from the brokerage operations of djj and approximately 8 of outside sales were from the scrap processing operations of djj 88 and 9 respectively in 2020

gross margins

in 2021 nucor recorded gross margins of 1103 billion 30 which was a substantial increase from 223 billion 11 in 2020



 

scrap prices are driven by the global supply and demand for scrap and other ironbased raw materials used to make steel scrap prices increased during most of 2021 but began to decline late in the year we are seeing the trend of lower scrap prices as we begin 2022 

 



 

 



 



 

marketing administrative and other expenses

a major component of marketing administrative and other expenses is profit sharing and other incentive compensation costs these costs which are based upon and fluctuate with nucor’s financial performance increased from 2020 to 2021 due to the increased profitability of the company in 2021 profit sharing costs consisted of 8699 million of contributions including the company’s matching contribution made to the company’s profit sharing and retirement savings plan for qualified employees 866 million in 2020 other employee bonus costs also fluctuate based on nucor’s achievement of certain financial performance goals including achieving record earnings and comparisons of nucor’s financial performance to peers in the steel industry and other companies stockbased compensation included in marketing administrative and other expenses increased by 111 to 617 million in 2021 compared with 292 million in 2020 and includes costs associated with vesting of stock awards granted in prior years

included in marketing administrative and other expenses in 2020 was 182 million of restructuring charges related to the realignment of nucor’s metal buildings business in the steel products segment 

equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates

equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates was 1031 million in 2021 and 105 million in 2020 the improvement in equity method investment earnings from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to the increased results of numit and nucorjfe losses and impairments of assets 

in 2020 nucor recorded losses on assets of 4835 million related to our equity method investment in duferdofin nucor srl “duferdofin nucor” nucor also recorded impairment charges in 2020 of 1032 million related to certain inventory and longlived assets in the steel mills segment and 270 million related to the writedown of our unproved natural gas well assets included in the raw materials segment

 

during 2021 nucor recorded a noncash loss on assets of 420 million related to our leasehold interest in unproved oil and natural gas properties in the raw materials segment also included in the 2021 results were losses on assets of 202 million in the steel products segment   

interest expense income 

net interest expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was as follows in thousands

 



 

interest expense decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to lower average interest rates on debt and an increase in capital interest interest income decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to a decrease in average interest rates on investments

earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 

the following table presents earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests by segment for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in thousands the changes between periods were driven by the quantitative and qualitative factors previously discussed

 



noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests represent the income attributable to the noncontrolling partners of nucor’s joint ventures primarily nucor–yamato of which nucor owns 51 the 157 increase in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to the increased earnings of nucor–yamato driving the significant increase in earnings at nucoryamato in 2021 was higher average selling prices volumes and metal margins under the nucor–yamato limited partnership agreement the minimum amount of cash to be distributed each year to the partners is the amount needed by each partner to pay applicable us federal and state income taxes in 2020 the amount of cash distributed to noncontrolling interest holders was more than the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests based on mutual agreement of the general partners however the cumulative amount of cash distributed to partners was less than the cumulative net earnings of the partnership

provision for income taxes

the company’s effective tax rate in 2021 was 2259 compared with 006 in 2020 the 2020 effective rate included a net tax benefit of 2019 million 2416 for a tax loss on our investment in duferdofin nucor a net tax benefit of 452 million 541 for state tax credits and a federal tax benefit of 482 million 577 for the carryback of a federal tax net operating loss an “nol” under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” these benefits were all recognized in 2020 and were partially offset by the rate impact 112 of financial statement impairments of 4456 million which did not affect the provision for income taxes the cares act allowed for an nol generated in 2020 to be carried back to taxable years where the federal income tax rate was 35 the difference in the tax rate in 2020 and tax years before the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 is the main driver of the federal tax nol benefit in 2020 but this was partially offset by the partial loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction in the carryback year

nucor has concluded us federal income tax matters for tax years through 2014 and for tax year 2016 the tax years 2015 and 2017 through 2020 remain open to examination by the internal revenue service the 2015 canadian income tax returns for harris steel group inc and certain related affiliates are currently under examination by the canada revenue agency the tax years 2015 through 2020 remain open to examination by other major taxing jurisdictions to which nucor is subject primarily canada and other state and local jurisdictions 

net earnings and return on equity

nucor reported net earnings of 683 billion or 2316 per diluted share in 2021 compared to net earnings of 7215 million or 236 per diluted share in 2020 net earnings attributable to nucor stockholders as a percentage of net sales were 187 and 36 in 2021 and 2020 respectively return on average stockholders’ equity was 550 and 68 in 2021 and 2020 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe our financial strength is a key strategic advantage among domestic steel producers particularly during recessionary business cycles we carry the highest credit ratings of any steel producer headquartered in north america with an a longterm rating from standard and poor’s and a baa1 longterm rating from moody’s our credit ratings are dependent however on many factors both qualitative and quantitative and are subject to change at any time the disclosure of our credit ratings is made to enhance investors’ understanding of our sources of liquidity and the impact of our credit ratings on our cost of funds

nucor’s cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and cash equivalents position remained strong at 276 billion as of december 31 2021 compared with 316 billion as of december 31 2020 approximately 5403 million and 3160 million of the cash and cash equivalents position as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively was held by our majorityowned joint ventures cash flows provided by operating activities provide us with a significant source of liquidity when needed we have external shortterm financing sources available including the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under our bank credit facilities 

we also issue longterm debt securities from timetotime in august 2021 nucor became an obligor with respect to 1970 million in 40year variablerate green bonds to partially fund the capital costs  in particular the expenditures associated with pollution prevention and control including waste recycling and waste reduction of the construction of our plate mill located in brandenburg kentucky proceeds of the green bonds are held on nucor’s balance sheet as restricted cash and cash equivalents until they are utilized in connection with the construction of the brandenburg facility

on november 5 2021 nucor completed an offer to exchange its existing 2979 notes due 2055 the “2055 notes” that were not registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” for a like principal amount of notes having terms substantially identical as the 2055 notes and that are registered under the securities act

in november 2021 nucor amended and restated its revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity from 150 billion to 175 billion and to extend its maturity date to november 5 2026 our revolving credit facility remains undrawn

we expect to continue to have adequate access to the capital markets at a reasonable cost of funds for liquidity purposes when needed

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 

 



 

the current ratio which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities was 25 at yearend 2021 compared with 36 at yearend 2020 the current ratio was impacted by higher salaries wages and related accruals for incentive compensation during a period of record operating profits in addition 6000 million aggregate principal amount of our longterm debt outstanding will become due in september 2022 and was reclassified as a current maturity as of yearend 2021 

in 2021 total accounts receivable turned approximately every four weeks and inventories turned approximately every 10 weeks these ratios compare with accounts receivable turnover of approximately every six weeks and inventory turnover of approximately every 11 weeks for 2020

funds provided by operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments restricted cash and cash equivalents and new borrowings under existing credit facilities are expected to be adequate to meet future capital expenditures current debt maturities and working capital requirements for existing operations for at least the next 24 months we also believe we have adequate access to capital markets for liquidity purposes in september 2022 6000 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 4125 notes due 2022 will mature and in august 2023 5000 million aggregate principal amount of our 4000 notes due 2023 will mature

offbalance sheet arrangements

we have a simple capital structure with no offbalance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated special purpose entities that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity

capital allocation strategy

we believe that our conservative financial practices have served us well in the past and are serving us well today nucor’s financial strength allows for a consistent balanced approach to capital allocation throughout the business cycle nucor’s highest capital allocation priority is to invest in our business for profitable growth over the long term we have historically done this by investing to optimize our existing operations initiate greenfield expansions and make acquisitions our second priority is to return capital to our stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases we intend to return a minimum of 40 of our net earnings to our stockholders while maintaining a debttocapital ratio that supports a strong investment grade credit rating the company repurchased approximately 328 billion of shares of its common stock in 2021 approximately 395 million in 2020 and 2985 million in 2019 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 623 billion in 2021 as compared to 270 billion in 2020 this increase of 353 billion was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings of 629 billion over the prior year which included 622 million of noncash losses and impairments of assets 6136 million of noncash losses and impairments of assets in 2020 these increases were partially offset by the changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting in a net outflow of 186 billion in 2021 as compared to a net inflow of 204 million in 2020 the changes in working capital were primarily due to increases in inventory and accounts receivable from yearend 2020 to the end of 2021 as compared to the same prior year period offset by increases in salaries wages and related accruals federal income taxes and accounts payable accounts receivable at the end of 2021 increased from the prior yearend resulting in a cash outflow of 139 billion due to a 100 increase in composite sales price in 2020 accounts receivable increased from the prior yearend by a lesser amount for an outflow of only 1293 million from yearend 2020 to yearend 2021 inventories increased resulting in an outflow of 231 billion due to a 19 increase in inventory tons and a 47 increase in average scrap and scrap substitutes cost per ton in inventory this compares to inventories at yearend 2020 decreasing from yearend 2019 and resulting in a 2841 million cash inflow salaries wages and related accruals increased due to higher current year profit sharing and incentive compensation accruals due to record operating profits federal income taxes also increased due to the increased profitability of the company and accounts payable increased due to the increases in inventory mentioned previously 

investing activities

our business is capital intensive therefore cash used in investing activities primarily represents capital expenditures for the construction of new facilities the expansion and upgrading of existing facilities and the acquisition of other companies cash used in investing activities in 2021 was 287 billion as compared to 176 billion in 2020 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a 134 billion increase in cash used to fund acquisitions mainly the august 2021 purchases of the imp business of cornerstone and the steel racking solutions business from hannibal cash used for capital expenditures increased by 788 million to 162 billion in 2021 as compared to 154 billion in 2020 the primary drivers of capital expenditures were related to the sheet mill expansion at nucor steel gallatin the flex galvanizing line at nucor steel arkansas and the new plate mill in brandenburg kentucky the increases in cash used in investing activities in 2021 was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of investments of 6489 million in 2021 as compared to 3922 million in 2020 

financing activities

cash used in financing activities during 2021 was 360 billion as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 2859 million in 2020 the largest driver of this change was the 328 billion of stock repurchases in 2021 as compared to 395 million in the prior year this was partially offset primarily by a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of approximately 100 billion proceeds of 1970 million in 2021 related to the issuance of additional 40year variablerate green bonds as compared to aggregate issuances of 124 billion in 2020 

our revolving credit facility is undrawn and was amended and restated in november 2021 to increase the borrowing capacity from 150 billion to 175 billion and to extend the maturity date to november 5 2026 the revolving credit facility includes only one financial covenant which is a limit of 60 on the ratio of funded debt to total capital in addition the undrawn revolving credit facility contains customary nonfinancial covenants including a limit on nucor’s ability to pledge the company’s assets and a limit on consolidations mergers and sales of assets as of december 31 2021 nucor’s funded debt to total capital ratio was 28 and nucor was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility

market risk 

nucor’s largest exposure to market risk is in our steel mills and steel products segments our utilization rates for the steel mills and steel products facilities for the fourth quarter of 2021 were 89 and 71 respectively a significant portion of our steel mills and steel products segments’ sales are into the commercial industrial and municipal construction markets our largest single customer in 2021 represented just 5 of sales and consistently pays within terms in the raw materials segment we are exposed to price fluctuations related to the purchase of scrap steel pig iron and iron ore our exposure to market risk is mitigated by the fact that our steel mills use a significant portion of the products of this segment and the prices we receive for our steel and steel products tend to be correlated with the prices we pay for these materials

nucor’s taxexempt industrial development revenue bonds “idrbs” have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly these idrbs represented 24 of nucor’s longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2021 the remaining 76 of nucor’s longterm debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings from time to time nucor makes use of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk as of december 31 2021 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to partially manage its exposure to price risk related to purchases of natural gas used in the production process as well as scrap copper and aluminum purchased for resale to its customers in addition nucor uses forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time to hedge cash flows associated with certain assets and liabilities firm commitments and anticipated transactions nucor generally does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than hedging the cash flows associated with specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in future periods and hedging the exposures related to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixedrate debt instruments and foreign currency transactions nucor recognizes all derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and mexico we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations

dividends

nucor has increased its base cash dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 1973 nucor paid dividends of 162 per share in 2021 compared with 161 per share in 2020 in december 2021 the board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend on nucor’s common stock to 050 per share nucor returned approximately 376 billion in capital to its stockholders in the form of base dividends and share repurchases in 2021 in february 2022 the board of directors declared nucor’s 196 th consecutive quarterly cash dividend of 050 per share payable on may 11 2022 to stockholders of record as of march 31 2022

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december 31 2021 for the periods presented in thousands

 



 









note in addition to the amounts shown in the table above 951 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled related to these unrecognized tax benefits we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of 175 million at december 31 2021

outlook 

in 2022 we expect to continue to take advantage of our position of strength to grow nucor’s longterm earnings power and stockholder value by continuing to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework and successfully focusing on profitable growth strategies we have invested significant capital over a broad range of strategic acquisitions and investments that we believe will further enhance our ability to grow nucor’s longterm earnings power by increasing our channels to market expanding our product portfolios into higher valueadded offerings that are less vulnerable to imports improving our cost structure and further building upon our market leadership positions and further enhance our commercial excellence we are utilizing nucor’s financial strength to execute on investment opportunities to further grow our longterm earnings capacity

 

enduse market demand remains strong for steel and steel products and we anticipate that 2022 will be another year of strong profitability for nucor we expect consolidated net earnings attributable to nucor stockholders in the first quarter of 2022 will be slightly reduced from the record results of the fourth quarter of 2021 diluted earnings per share for first quarter of 2022 should benefit from lower weighted average shares outstanding

 

 

steel mill segment earnings are expected to decline in the first quarter of 2022 due to decreased profitability of our sheet mills the steel products segment is expected to achieve further margin expansion and profitability in the first quarter of 2022 as backlog pricing has improved reflecting higher steel costs earnings of the raw materials segment are expected to improve slightly in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the improved profitability of our dri facilities partially offset by the impact of lower scrap prices on our scrap brokerage and processing operations

 

we are ever mindful of the threat of increases in imported steel stemming from the still significant excess foreign steel capacity over the past decade the steel industry has won several important trade cases that addressed unfairly traded imports

 

we are committed to executing on the opportunities we see ahead to reward nucor stockholders with very attractive longterm returns on their valuable capital invested in our company our industryleading financial strength allows us to support investments in our facilities that we believe will enable us to generate increased profitability capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately 23 billion in 2022 and as we have in our past we will allocate capital to investments that we believe will build our longterm earnings power 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to the valuation allowances for receivables the carrying value of noncurrent assets and reserves for environmental obligations and income taxes our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources accordingly actual costs could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

inventories

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value the company records any amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value as a charge to cost of products sold scrap and scrap substitute costs are a very significant component of the raw material semifinished and finished product inventory balances the vast majority of the company’s inventory is recorded on the firstin firstout method production costs are applied to semifinished and finished product inventory from the approximate period in which they are produced

longlived asset impairments

we evaluate our property plant and equipment and finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment on an individual asset basis or at the lowest level asset grouping for which cash flows can be independently identified asset impairments are assessed whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets could exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows in developing estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations we utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce when it is determined that an impairment exists the related assets are written down to estimated fair market value management determined that no longlived asset impairment testing was required in 2021 

certain longlived asset groupings were tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 20 2 0  undiscounted cash flows for each asset grouping were estimated using management’s longrange estimates of market conditions associated with each asset grouping over the estimated useful life of the principal asset within the group our undiscounted cash flow analysis indicated that  other than the groupings discussed below  the tested longlived asset groupings were recoverable as of december 31 20 2 0  

steel mills segment asset impairments

in 2019 nucor recorded a noncash impairment charge of 200 million related to certain property plant and equipment at our plate mill in texas this charge is included in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 

in 2020 nucor recorded noncash impairment charges totaling 1032 million related to certain inventory and longlived assets which primarily related to our castrip sheet mill operations due to the advancements in the capabilities at our new cold mill and galvanizing line we have under construction at nucor steel arkansas we believe the value of the technology and process has diminished for nucor as such the existing castrip assets are not expected to be materially utilized going forward these charges are included in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2020

raw materials segment asset impairments

in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the deteriorating natural gas pricing environment at our sales point in the piceance basin as well as the decreased performance of the natural gas well assets nucor determined a triggering event had occurred and performed an impairment analysis on all three fields of wells as a result of the fourth quarter of 2019 analysis a 350 million noncash impairment charge was recorded on one field of wells an increase in the estimated lease operating cost projections was the primary factor in causing this field of wells to be impaired the noncash impairment charge is included in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2019

one of the primary assumptions that affects the undiscounted cash flows determination is management’s estimate of future pricing of natural gas and natural gas liquids the pricing used in the impairment assessments was developed by management based on projected natural gas market supply and demand dynamics in conjunction with a review of projections by market analysts management also makes estimates on the expected reserve levels and on the expected lease operating costs the impairment assessments were performed on each of nucor’s three fields of wells with each field defined by common geographic location the combined carrying value of the three fields of wells was 652 million at december 31 2021 717 million at december 31 2020

changes in the natural gas industry or a prolonged lowprice environment beyond what had already been assumed in the assessments could cause management to revise the natural gas and natural gas liquids price assumptions the estimated reserves or the estimated lease operating costs unfavorable revisions to these assumptions or estimates could possibly result in further impairment of some or all of the fields of proved well assets

in 2020 regulatory authorities in colorado adopted new rules that became effective january 2021 one of these rules increases drilling setback distances in the fourth quarter of 2020 nucor determined a triggering event had occurred as we do not expect to be able to access the full extent of the resources in the ground and performed an impairment analysis as a result nucor recorded a 270 million noncash impairment charge related to the writedown of our leasehold interest in unproved oil and gas properties this charge is included in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2020

in the second quarter of 2021 nucor decided that it would not develop a portion of its unproved oil and natural gas properties “portion a” within the contractually specified time period related to portion a as a result of this decision the company will forfeit its leasehold rights for portion a the company recorded a charge of 420 million to write off the value of portion a that is included in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2021 the decision not to develop portion a was heavily influenced by the approaching deadline to commence development combined with portion a’s expected nearterm profitability not achieving management’s desired returns relative to the cost of development a significant portion of the company’s remaining leasehold interest in unproved oil and natural gas properties are held by production accordingly management does not believe the value assigned to those portions needs to be evaluated at this time the carrying value of the remaining portions of unproved oil and natural gas properties was 960 million at december 31 2021 

goodwill and intangibles

goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred we perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the recorded value including goodwill

when appropriate nucor performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for certain reporting units it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis in these instances a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of these reporting units significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as part of our annual testing and any required interim testing include i expected cash flow for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices raw materials and other costs to produce and estimated capital needs ii an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit iii a discount rate based on management’s best estimate of the aftertax weightedaverage cost of capital and iv a probabilityweighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence management considers historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate

our fourth quarter 2021 annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge management does not believe that future impairment of these reporting units is probable however the performance of certain businesses that comprise our reporting units requires continued improvement an increase of approximately 50 basis points in the discount rate a critical assumption in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value would not result in an impairment charge see note 8 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the results of the company’s 2021 annual goodwill impairment analysis

nucor will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout 2022 in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual qualitative andor quantitative impairment test during our fourth quarter of 2022 changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill

equity method investments 

investments in joint ventures in which nucor shares control over the financial and operating decisions but in which nucor is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method each of the company’s equity method investments is subject to a review for impairment if and when circumstances indicate that a decline in value below its carrying amount may have occurred examples of such circumstances include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in the earnings performance or business prospects of the investee missed financial projections a significant adverse change in the regulatory tax economic or technological environment of the investee a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates and recurring negative cash flows from operations when management considers the decline to be other than temporary the company would write down the related investment to its estimated fair market value an otherthantemporary decline in carrying value is determined to have occurred when in management’s judgment a decline in fair value below carrying value is of such length of time andor severity that it is considered longterm

in the event that an impairment review is necessary we calculate the estimated fair value of our equity method investments using a probabilityweighted multiplescenario income approach management’s analysis includes three discounted cash flow scenarios best case base case and recessionary case which contain forecasted nearterm cash flows under each scenario generally i the best case scenario contains estimates of future results ranging from slightly higher than recent operating performance to levels that are consistent with historical operating and financial performance ii the base case scenario contains estimates of future results ranging from generally in line with recent operating performance to levels that are more conservative than historical operating and financial performance and iii the recessionary case scenario contains estimates of future results which include limited growth resulting only from operational cost improvements and limited benefits of new highervalue product offerings management determines the probability that each cash flow scenario will come to fruition based on the specific facts and circumstances of each of the preceding scenarios with the base case typically receiving the majority of the weighting

key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our equity method investments include i expected cash flow for the sixyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs ii an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the investment iii a discount rate based on management’s best estimate of the aftertax weightedaverage cost of capital and iv a probabilityweighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence while the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include projected revenues metal margins and discount rate the assumptions are often interdependent and no single factor predominates in determining the estimated fair value management considers historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its investments are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate

nucor determined that a triggering event occurred in the first quarter of 2020 with respect to its equity method investment in duferdofin nucor due to adverse developments in the joint venture’s commercial outlook which were exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic all of which negatively impacted the joint venture’s strategic direction after completing its impairment assessment nucor determined that the carrying amount exceeded its estimated fair value and the impairment condition was considered to be other than temporary therefore nucor recorded a 2500 million impairment charge in the first quarter of 2020 the assumptions that most significantly affected the fair value determination included projected cash flows and the discount rate the companyspecific inputs for measuring fair value are considered “level 3” or unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data under applicable fair value authoritative guidance as quoted market prices are not available

throughout 2020 additional capital contributions were made by the company to duferdofin nucor that were immediately impaired these additional capital contributions resulted in 50 million 66 million and 254 million impairment charges against our investment in duferdofin nucor in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 respectively also in the fourth quarter of 2020  nucor reclassified into earnings 1586 million of cumulative foreign currency translation losses on our investment in duferdofin nucor in 2020 total impairment charges including the charge associated with forgiving and outstanding note receivable  related to our investment in duferdofin nucor were approximately 4835 million these noncash impairment charges are included in the steel mills segment and in losses and impairment s of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2020  

income taxes

we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes under the liability method deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations are recognized as a component of interest expense and other expenses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them

interest rate risk – nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2021 approximately 24 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly the remaining 76 of nucor’s longterm debt was at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2021 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk – in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in periods of strong or stable demand for our products we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for our products is weaker this becomes more challenging our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs dri is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic steel production 

natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to partially offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states 

nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in net earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2021 accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes included 11 million in unrealized netoftax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of the derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2021 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands

 



 

any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities

foreign currency risk – nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and mexico we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2021 and 2020 were insignificant

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2020 we recycled approximately 178 million gross tons of scrap steel

segments principle products produced and markets and marketing 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials the steel mills segment is nucor’s largest segment representing 60 of the company’s sales to external customers in the year ended december 31 2020 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces we also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad the markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions

we are a leading domestic provider for most of the products we supply and in many cases eg structural steel merchant bar steel steel joist and deck preengineered metal buildings steel piling and cold finish bar steel we are the leading supplier 

steel mills segment 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces sheet steel hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks hpiling and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar and engineered special bar quality “sbq” nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces “eafs” continuous casting and automated rolling mills the steel mills segment also includes nucor’s equity method investments in numit llc “numit” and nucorjfe steel mexico s de rl de cv “nucorjfe” as well as international trading and distribution companies that buy and sell steel manufactured by the company and other steel producers 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada and mexico the steel mills segment sold approximately 18049000 tons to outside customers in 2020 

 

 

the following chart shows our outside steel shipments by end market 

in 2020 80 of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers the remaining 20 of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our tubular products piling distributor joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 



steel produced by our bar mills has a wide usage serving end markets including the agricultural automotive construction energy furniture machinery metal building railroad recreational equipment shipbuilding heavy truck and trailer market segments considering nucor’s production capabilities and the mix of bar products generally produced and marketed the capacity of the bar mills is estimated at approximately 9560000 tons per year

raw materials segment 

in the raw materials segment nucor produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas drilling operations nucor’s raw materials investments are focused on creating an advantage for its steelmaking operations through a global information network and a multipronged and flexible approach to metallics supply



djj is the leading broker of ferrous scrap in north america and is a global trader of scrap metal pig iron and other metallics in addition to sourcing steel scrap for nucor’s mills djj is a global trader of ferroalloys and nonferrous metals djj’s logistics team owns and operates one of the largest independent fleets of railcars in the united states dedicated to the movement of scrap and steel and also offers railcar leasing and railcar fleet management services these activities have strategic value to nucor as the leading and most diversified north american steel producer

 

our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are eaf steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills  and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 20 20  approximately 9  of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitute tons we brokered and processed were sold to external customers we consumed the balance in our steel mills 



nucor’s dri production capabilities provide our steel mills flexibility to quickly adjust the metallic mix to changing market conditions and to maintain competitiveness in the sometimesvolatile scrap market with the potential for highquality scrap becoming scarcer coupled with the risk of thirdparty supplier disruptions nucor’s dri facilities provide a greater degree of certainty over its metallics supply



nucor’s access to a longterm lowcost supply of natural gas is a component in the execution of nucor’s raw material strategy natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our dri plant in louisiana and our steel mills in the united states

customers 

a significant portion of our steel mills and steel products segments’ sales are into the commercial industrial and municipal construction markets we have a diverse customer base and are not dependent on any single customer our largest single customer in 2020 represented less than 5 of sales and consistently pays within terms our steel mills use a significant portion of the products of the raw materials segment 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to expand our product portfolio to include more valueadded steel mill products and capabilities improve our cost structure enhance our operational flexibility and provide additional channels to market for our products these investments totaled approximately 424 billion over the last three years with approximately 95 going to capital expenditures and the remainder going to acquisitions we believe that our focus on lowering costs and diversifying our operations will enable us to deliver profitable longterm growth further we believe shifting our product mix to a greater proportion of valueadded products and increasing enduse market diversity will make us less susceptible to being negatively impacted by imports

several new capital projects that support our expansion of valueadded product offerings and costreduction strategies were completed in 2020 nucor’s 245 million rebar micro mill near kansas city in sedalia missouri finished commissioning in the second quarter of 2020 and is capable of producing approximately 380000 tons annually we believe that positioning the micro mill near the kansas city market will provide us with a freight cost advantage relative to more distant suppliers and we will also benefit from the scrap supply in the immediate area provided by our existing djj operations in december 2020 nucor’s 249 million investment in a new rebar micro mill in frostproof florida began production and commissioning this mill is capable of producing approximately 350000 tons annually we believe this new micro mill will also benefit from the scrap supply in the immediate area provided by 

 

our existing djj operations as well as strong regional demand for its products  also i n december 2020 nucor steel kankakee inc finished commissioning its fullrange merchant bar quality mill with approximately 500000 tons of annual capacity at its existing mill in bourbonnais illinois at a cost of 187 million like the new micro mill s  we believe that the kankakee mill will also benefit from logistical advantages serving its customers and lowcost scrap supply 

nucor is constructing a new 325 million 3 rd generation flexible galvanizing line with an annual capacity of approximately 500000 tons at our nucor steel arkansas facility this project complements the new 245 million specialty cold mill at nucor steel arkansas that completed its first full year of production in 2020 we believe these investments will accelerate our goal of increasing our automotive market share the new galvanizing line is expected to be operational in the second half of 2021 in september 2018 nucor announced an approximately 650 million investment to modernize and expand the production capability at its gallatin flatrolled sheet mill located in ghent kentucky this investment will increase the production capability from approximately 1400000 tons to approximately 3000000 tons annually and will increase the maximum coil width to approximately 73 inches this expansion is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021 and complements the mill’s new 200 million hot band galvanizing and pickling line that completed its first full year of production in 2020 in january 2019 nucor announced plans to build a stateoftheart plate mill which will be based in brandenburg kentucky on the ohio river with an expected investment of 170 billion we anticipate the mill will be completed in late 2022 and will be capable of producing approximately 1200000 tons per year of steel plate products

in addition to growing through capital expansions at our existing operations and acquisitions nucor also uses joint ventures as a platform for growth nucorjfe our joint venture with jfe steel corporation of japan in which nucor has 50 ownership resumed production in late 2020 after lengthy governmentmandated shutdowns related to the covid19 pandemic located in central mexico nucorjfe will supply galvanized sheet steel to the growing mexican automotive market the investment totaled 360 million with nucors share of these amounts being 50 nucor’s sheet mills are expected to provide a significant portion of the hotrolled steel substrate that will be consumed by nucorjfe

capital allocation strategy 

the significant developments in nucor’s business in recent years have been driven by our capital allocation strategy our highest capital allocation priority is to invest in our business for profitable longterm growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing existing operations greenfield expansions and acquisitions

our second priority is to return capital to our stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases nucor has paid 147 billion in dividends to its stockholders during the past three years that dividend payout represents 19 of cash flows from operations during that threeyear period the company repurchased 395 million of its common stock in 2020 2985 million in 2019 and 8540 million in 2018 

we intend to return at least 40 of our net income to stockholders over time via a combination of both cash dividends and share repurchases over the past three years we have returned approximately 61 of our net income in this manner at december 31 2020 the company had approximately 116 billion available for share repurchases under the current share repurchase program

we intend to execute on this strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet with relatively low financial leverage as measured in terms of net debt to total capital as well as ample liquidity at yearend 2020 our net debt to total capital was approximately 13 and we had cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and cash equivalents on hand of 316 billion at the end of 2020 nucor had the strongest credit ratings in the north american steel sector baa1a with stable outlooks at both moody’s and standard  poor’s

 

 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service

in our steel mills segment our eaf steel mills face many different forms of competition including domestic integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other domestic eaf steel mills steel imports and alternative materials large domestic integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs eafbased steel producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with large integrated steel producers eafbased steel producers also typically emit less carbon dioxide per ton of steel produced than integrated steel producers

the covid19 pandemic has exacerbated the ongoing risks nucor and the entire steel industry face from excess global steelmaking capacity particularly in nonmarket economies china set a record for steel production in 2020 despite the pandemic steel production in china rose from approximately 110 billion tons in 2019 to approximately 116 billion tons in 2020 as a result china’s share of global crude steel production rose from 533 in 2019 to 566 in 2020 the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” estimates that excess global steel production capacity will be approximately 776 million tons in 2020 up from 624 million tons in 2019 which was itself up significantly from the prior year china’s largest steel companies are stateowned and receive significant financial support from the chinese government

the section 232 steel tariffs implemented in 2018 continue to be effective in preventing the dumping of steel products in the us market successful industry trade cases over the past several years have had an impact on import levels as well for the full year 2020 imports of finished steel were down approximately 23 from the previous year and accounted for approximately 18 of us market share in 2020 finished steel import market share was at its lowest level since 2003 

the new united statesmexicocanada usmca trade agreement went into effect in july 2020 the agreement has several provisions that we believe will benefit the steel industry including requiring that higher levels of a vehicle’s content including steel be produced in north america for a vehicle to qualify for zero tariffs and that 70 of the steel used in vehicles be melted and poured in north america there are also provisions addressing currency manipulation and stateowned enterprises 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are often other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives can become more attractive to our customers

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 258 billion and 168 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from other nucor businesses nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 266 billion and 224 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the majority of these orders are expected to be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not meaningful because the vast majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally

 

sources and availability of raw materials 

an ample supply of highquality scrap and scrap substitutes is critical to support nucor’s ability to produce highquality steel nucor’s raw materials segment safely produces sources trades and transports steelmaking raw materials nucor’s raw materials investments are focused on creating an advantage for its steelmaking operations through a global information network and a multipronged and flexible approach to metallics supply

scrap and scrap substitutes are the most significant element in the total cost of steel production the average cost of scrap and scrap substitutes used in our steel mills segment decreased 8 from 314 per gross ton used in 2019 to 290 per gross ton used in 2020 on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce one ton of steel depending on the market conditions at the time a raw material surcharge or variable steel pricing mechanism may be implemented to assist nucor in maintaining operating margins and in meeting our customer commitments during periods of rapidly changing scrap and scrap substitute costs 

for the past decade nucor has focused on securing access to lowcost raw material inputs as they are the company’s largest expense we believe nucor’s broad balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallic inputs our investment in dri production facilities and scrap yards as well as our access to international raw materials markets provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw material costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil we believe the continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production as well as in the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj gives us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus helps us mitigate the risk of significant fluctuations in the availability and costs of critical inputs

djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate dri plants in trinidad and louisiana with respective annual production capacities of approximately 2000000 and 2500000 metric tons the primary raw material for our dri facilities is pelletized iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers another major source of raw materials used in the production of steel is pig iron we received over 26 million gross tons of pig iron in 2020 as with scrap and iron ore we source pig iron from a number of international suppliers

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills energy consumption and costs 

most of our operations are energy intensive as a result we continuously strive to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient in addition we proactively engage with suppliers regulators and other energy industry participants to ensure the continued availability of reliable low cost sources of energy in various forms

our steel mills utilize eafs for 100 of their steel production with approximately 50 of their total energy consumed as electricity the total energy consumed by nucor also includes natural gas oxygen and carbon raw material inputs for the scrap melting process electricity is the primary energy source with natural gas combustion serving as the fuel for reheat furnaces and other preheating operations our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas 

the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today by many factors including changes in supply and demand the regulatory environment and pipelinetransmission infrastructure

we closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption we work with policymakers to provide technical information that can inform policy making and avoid 

 

unintended adverse consequences of legislative and regulatory actions we believe that a thoughtful approach to domestic energy policy can help ensure that steel and steel products manufactured in the united states remain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace 

greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions by the energy sector have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years as more people become concerned that these emissions are a significant contributor to climate change this has led to increasing support for and investment in low or zero carbon energy generation technologies such as solar wind and nuclear as a result the development of these technologies has accelerated and in many cases they are now more cost competitive with traditional fossil fuelbased power generation we believe that this ongoing diversification of power generation technologies is fundamentally positive but without careful planning and investment there is some risk to the reliability of the domestic power grid as this transition continues in particular legacy fossil fuelbased assets will remain essential for some time to come and the us transmission grid is broadly in need of substantial upgrades to take full advantage of these newer more intermittent power sources we are also optimistic about the related demand for our products as transmission grid upgrades are executed and newer power generation assets are developed using steel

in november of 2020 we executed a 15year 250megawatt virtual power purchase agreement “vppa” with a major north american renewable energy company under the vppa we have agreed to purchase for a fixed price a portion of the output of a solar array being developed in northwestern texas the vppa will be settled financially on a monthly basis we have undertaken this initiative to support the ongoing transition of the us power grid to a greater reliance on renewable power as part of this arrangement we will also receive renewable energy credits “recs” commensurate with the power we purchase these recs can be applied against a portion of our ghg emissions enabling us to receive credit for reducing them the pay fixed received floating nature of this arrangement also offsets a portion of our exposure to higher prices for electricity over the life of the contract we are evaluating and considering more transactions like this one

we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges as well as our owned natural gas drilling operations in addition to the currently producing wells in the piceance basin nucor owns leasehold interests in natural gas properties in the south piceance basin in the western slope of colorado to support nucor’s operating wells and potential future well developments on these properties nucor has entered into longterm agreements directly with thirdparty gathering and processing service providers natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our dri plant in louisiana and by our steel mills in the united states nucor has full discretion on its participation in all future drilling capital investments

government and environmental regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations the most significant of which are intended to protect our teammates and the environment due to the nature of the steel industry we are subject to substantial regulations related to safety in the workplace in addition to the requirements of the state and local governments of the communities in which we operate we must comply with federal health and safety regulations the most significant of which are enforced by the occupational safety and health administration “osha” because safety and safety compliance is one of our primary values its effect on our capital expenditures earnings and competitive position is not estimable

nucor operates a robust and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of each individual teammate as well as management being responsible for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification requires nucor’s steel mills to implement an environmental management system with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use 

the principal federal environmental laws that regulate our business include the clean air act the “caa” that regulates air emissions the clean water act the “cwa” that regulates water withdrawals and discharges the resource conservation and recovery act the “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response 

 

compensation and liability act the “cercla” that governs releases of hazardous substances and remediation of contaminated sites our operations are also subject to state and local environmental laws and regulations 

as it relates to air emission rates eafs are the most efficient and cleanest steel making process commercially available today in comparison to blast furnaces emissions of sulfur oxides from eafs are approximately 14 of the amount emitted from blast furnaces eafs emit less than 1 of the particulate emissions compared to blast furnace operations importantly eaf emissions of greenhouse gases per ton of steel average less than half of the rates typically generated by blast furnaces operating eafs instead of blast furnaces is a proven air quality improvement strategy in addition each of our steel mills operate air pollution control devices baghouses to collect and capture particulate emissions “eaf dust” from the steel making process we strive to maintain compliance with all applicable caa requirements

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal as mentioned previously the process of recycling scrap metal generates particulate matter emissions that includes contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals initially the particulate matter captured and collected is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals the eaf dust is recycled to recover these metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it collects to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor believes it is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but it is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both the cercla and the rcra

in addition to recycling eaf dust nucor mills beneficially reuse steel slag in road materials as a granular base embankments engineered fill highway shoulders and hot mix asphalt pavement the physical chemical mechanical and thermal properties of steel slag provide a vital resource for construction companies and activities we take considerable pride in our recycling efforts 

notably in both 2019 and 2018 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” identified nucor as a top 10 parent company in terms of pollution source reduction activities in its assessment publication national analysis of toxics release inventory to illustrate potential reduction strategies the epa used a nucor facility as an example of pollution prevention nucor focuses on pollution prevention at all of our facilities 

not only does the rcra establish standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes the rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling and storage of most wastes periodically past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are discovered when the epa determines these offsite properties are contaminated nucor quickly evaluates such claims and if nucor is determined to be responsible we do our part to remediate our share of such issues nucor believes all identified liabilities under the rcra are either currently being resolved or have been fully resolved 

because nucor has historically implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under the cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor regularly evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under the rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor believes that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them

to protect water resources the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals when applicable nucor maintains discharge and water withdrawal permits at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those 

 

permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments if the facility discharges into publicly owned treatment works 

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2021 and 2022 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year

human capital resources 

culture organization and compensation

we consider our teammates the most important part of nucor and believe that our culture – and the encouragement that we provide to our teammates to “grow the core expand beyond and live our culture” – provides us with a competitive advantage our culture’s key principles are safety first trust open communications teamwork community stewardship and results 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure that allows our teammates to make quick decisions and innovate our organization is also highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their teams with more than 26000 teammates only 150 work in our principal executive offices in charlotte north carolina by empowering our teammates our goal is to foster an entrepreneurial mindset along with a strong sense of personal responsibility and a culture of accountability this empowerment is reinforced by our compensation policies so as to drive results and contribute to our success 

teammate input is essential for us to maintain our culture of empowering teammates to make operational decisions aside from our practice of everyday open communication we periodically ask our teammates to formally provide feedback beginning in 1986 we have asked our teammates to complete a comprehensive survey in order to gather feedback on a range of topics including matters relating to the effectiveness of our culture we view the survey as an important tool we use to continually improve our company and ensure our teammates remain engaged and satisfied this survey is conducted every three years the last of which was conducted in 2019 in the most recent survey 90 of the responses were favorable in the category of “satisfaction  commitment” the overall percentage of negative responses in the most recent survey has dropped by 25 percentage points since the survey began in 1986 teammates of certain previously acquired businesses – most notably djj and harris which together accounted for approximately 27 of our workforce as of december 31 2020 – complete comparable surveys that have also shown an improving trend over time

safety

one of nucor’s core values is our teammates’ wellbeing and safety and it is our goal to become the safest steel company in the world our foremost responsibility is to work safely which requires our teammates to identify unsafe conditions and activities and mitigate these hazards we will continue working to eliminate exposures that can lead to injury and encourage our teammates to share their ideas for safety improvement two key metrics nucor uses to measure safety are the injuryillness rate and days away restricted and transfer “dart” case rate 

nucor calculates the annual injuryillness rate by dividing the number of workrelated injuries and illnesses by the total number of hours worked by all nucor teammates in a given year and then multiplying the resulting percentage by 200000 the equivalent of 100 fulltime employees working 40 hours per week 50 weeks per year in 2020 we achieved an annual injuryillness rate of 110

nucor uses the dart case rate to assess and manage the risk of serious injury in the workplace nucor calculates the annual dart case rate by dividing the number of cases resulting in days away from work restricted work activity andor job transfers by the total number of hours worked by all nucor teammates in a given year and then multiplying the resulting percentage by 200000 the equivalent of 

 

100 fulltime employees working 40 hours per week 50 weeks per year in 2020 we achieved an annual dart case rate of 059 

beginning in 1998 nucor has used the president’s safety award to recognize divisions that achieve strong records of safety performance based on objective metrics since 2004 the president’s safety award has gone to divisions and mills where the injuryillness rate and dart case rate are less than onethird the national average for comparable facilities in 2020 40 of nucor’s mills and divisions achieved the president’s safety award nucor also has 25 osha voluntary protection program sites osha’s highest level of recognition

our teammates

nucor had approximately 26400 teammates as of december 31 2020 the vast majority of our teammates are located in the united states with only a small number of teammates located outside of north america our operations are highly automated allowing us to take advantage of lower employment costs while still providing our teammates with compensation that we believe is highly competitive as compared to comparable businesses in our industry at nucor we believe in “payforperformance” nucor teammates typically earn a significant part of their compensation based on their productivity production teammates work under group incentives that provide increased earnings for increased production this additional incentive compensation is paid weekly in most cases nucor has also historically contributed 10 of earnings before federal taxes to a profit sharing plan for the majority of teammates below the officer level we believe such compensation practices incentivize our workforce and reinforce our culture

while nucor seeks to hire qualified and talented individuals as teammates we also believe in developing the skills of our workforce by providing educational and onthejob training in addition to safety training further nucor believes it is important for senior management to also be familiar with and have had direct experience running nucor’s mills and other operational divisions the vast majority of our teammates are not represented by labor unions and we believe our teammate turnover is low

at nucor we believe that a diversity of perspectives and background helps to facilitate the “nucor way” as we work to “grow the core expand beyond and live our culture” we also believe that recruiting and hiring the best talent available will continue to provide us with a more diverse and capable workforce in addition nucor has a long history of conducting our businesses in a manner consistent with high standards of social responsibility we have adopted a comprehensive human rights policy which operates in conjunction with many other nucor policies related to ethical conduct and human rights including our standards of business conduct and ethics code of ethics for senior financial professionals supplier code of conduct and policy on eliminating forced labor from our supply chain we will continue to evaluate our approach and look for opportunities to improve so that nucor and its stockholders benefit to the greatest extent possible from our teammates

 item 1a 

risk factors

tableend

many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

industry specific risk factors

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

recent additions of new steelmaking capacity and the decrease in steel production due to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic has caused excess steelmaking capacity to grow during the last two years after several years of decline according to the oecd global steel production overcapacity is projected to be approximately 776 million tons in 2020 china continues to be a significant contributor to excess steelmaking capacity 

during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand for steel and steel products this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

section 232 steel tariffs are currently keeping some dumped steel products out of the us market the us government has also been negotiating new trade agreements with many countries including china which may provide another opportunity to address excess steelmaking capacity should these efforts be abandoned or fail to reduce the impact of global excess capacity and the section 232 tariffs be lifted us steelmakers would be at greater risk of having to compete against steel products dumped in the us market

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements

our operations are capital intensive for the threeyear period ended december 31 2020 our total capital expenditures were approximately 404 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds shortterm commercial paper issuance offerings of our debt and equity securities or from borrowings under our 150 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot guarantee that this will be the case additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political regulatory and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions including physical or information systems related 

 

issues  that impact the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

competition from other steel producers imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price quality and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel steel products and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including the cost and availability of raw materials energy technology labor and capital costs currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products

since 2011 automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may seek to reduce the amount of steel they incorporate in their vehicles or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing their demand for steel certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy metals service centers appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the us economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the us economy is recovering from its lows during the second quarter of 2020 but the pace of the recovery in 2021 will likely depend on how quickly the us population is vaccinated and normal activities can resume as well as government stimulus programs or infrastructure spending even with this economic recovery challenges from global production overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties both in the united states and in other regions of the world remain

we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions future economic downturns prolonged slow growth or stagnation in the economy or a sectorspecific slowdown in one of our key enduse markets such as nonresidential construction could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows especially in light of the capitalintensive nature of our business

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our steel products the raw material required to produce dri is pelletized iron ore although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also by acquiring djj in 2008 we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states and internationally 

 

although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors as well as currency fluctuations at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs experience margin compressions or suffer harm to our reputation

our steelmaking processes our dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs the regulation of these ghgs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and accordingly we make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates most notably the uncertainty of policies enforcement priorities legislation and regulations related to climate change mitigation strategies pose the greatest risk

as a carbon steel producer nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if carbon policy decisions and mandates are not properly implemented carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s steel production processes furthermore nucor steel mills utilize eafs for 100 of their steel melting operations and the costs associated with the decarbonization of electricity generation is a significant concern significant new rulemaking or legislation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

environmental regulation compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position

we incur significant costs in meeting our environmental regulation compliance and remediation obligations the principal federal environmental laws include the caa that regulates air emissions the cwa that regulates water withdrawals and discharges rcra that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and cercla that governs releases of hazardous substances and remediation of contaminated sites our operations are also subject to state and local environmental laws and regulations capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2021 and 2022 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

in addition to the above mentioned statutes certain revisions to national air ambient quality standards could make it significantly more difficult for us to obtain construction permits and permits to expand existing operations resulting cancellations delays or unanticipated costs to these projects could negatively impact our ability to generate expected returns on our investments these regulations can also increase our cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process we may in the future incur substantially increased costs complying with such regulations particularly if federal regulatory agencies were to change their enforcement posture with respect to such regulations

 

emerging customer preferences for greater product transparency and less ghg intensive materials may put us at a competitive disadvantage or reduce demand for our products 

numerous states including washington oregon and new york are considering establishing requirements for environmental product declarations “epds” to evaluate environmental impacts of products california has enacted the “buy clean california act” and california has established global warming potential gwp benchmarks through epds for certain materials including certain steel products currently the federal government is considering similar legislation epd legislation has the potential to put domestic steel manufacturers at a disadvantage to foreign competitors unless standardized mechanisms are used to fully evaluate products produced by foreign steel producers

general risk factors

the covid19 pandemic as well as similar epidemics and public health emergencies in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics epidemics and other public health emergencies such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic which spread from china to many other countries including the united states in march 2020 the world health organization characterized the outbreak of covid19 as a pandemic and the united states declared the covid19 pandemic a national emergency

we are a company operating in a critical infrastructure industry as defined by the us department of homeland security as such nucor was deemed an essential or life ‐ sustaining operation and accordingly is currently able to maintain operations sufficient to meet our customers’ ongoing needs in spite of our continued operations the covid19 pandemic has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations supply chain transportation networks and customers which may compress our margins including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking the covid19 pandemic is a widespread public health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies of many countries and caused periodic disruption to financial markets any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and raw materials the progression of the covid19 pandemic could also negatively impact our business or results of operations through the temporary closure of our operating facilities or those of our customers or suppliers

in addition the ability of our teammates and our suppliers’ and customers’ teammates to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 our customers may be directly impacted by business interruptions or weak market conditions and may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations furthermore the progression of and global response to the covid19 pandemic has begun to cause and increases the risk of further delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects including potential delays in obtaining permits from government agencies the extent of such delays and other effects of covid19 on our capital projects certain of which are outside of our control is unknown but they could impact or delay the timing of anticipated benefits on capital projects

the extent to which covid19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and unpredictable including new information concerning the severity of the pandemic the availability of a vaccine evolving strains of the virus and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate the effects of the pandemic the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of covid19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

 

we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations threats from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks or system failures could 

 

result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information or personal data or reputational damage or could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel resulting in lost revenues as well as delays in reporting our financial results we also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems we may also contend with potential liability for stolen information increased cybersecurity protection costs litigation expense and increased insurance premiums 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes critical equipment failures acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset a portion of the losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent that any such losses are not covered by our insurance or that there are significant delays in resolving our claims with our insurance providers

we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses

risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations

certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states in canada mexico and in emerging markets there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets these risks include but are not limited to unfavorable political or economic factors local labor and social issues changes in regulatory requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and complex foreign laws treaties including tax laws and the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry as well as changes in interest rates commodity prices and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations

 

tax increases and changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the united states nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws

nucor recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are believed to be more likely than not of being sustained we cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit challenging any of our tax positions and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any challenges if we are unsuccessful in any of these matters we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods interest fines or penalties

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks

we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations contractual obligations and other legal standards notwithstanding this we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in respect of various issues including regulatory safety environmental employment transportation intellectual property contractual importexport international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings see “item 3 legal proceedings” a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the nature of our operations means that legal compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

tableend

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of nucor corporation should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report discusses our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 information concerning the year ended december 31 2019 and a comparison of the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 may be found under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed with the sec on february 28 2020

overview 

the covid19 pandemic began to impact nucor’s operations in the final weeks of the first quarter of 2020 it would rapidly become the most significant event of 2020 impacting almost all aspects of our business through the remainder of the year and into the present our most important value is the health and safety of our teammates their families and the communities where we operate we formed several internal task forces to closely monitor developments related to the pandemic our facilities around the country have taken steps to respond to covid19 based on the nature of their operations and the actions being taken by their state and local governments we have restricted travel upgraded the cleaning practices at our facilities and offices implemented remote work for teammates wherever possible and instituted social distancing measures throughout the company in addition to these measures which are still in effect to varying degrees we also took significant action to further strengthen our liquidity resources and financial position these financial measures are further explained in the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” across nucor we remain committed to protecting our teammates while minimizing disruptions to our customers and supply chain 

due to the impact of the pandemic the us economy shrank by 35 in 2020 compared to a growth rate of 22 in 2019 despite this demand in several key enduse markets was surprisingly resilient in 2020 most notably in nonresidential construction and automotive which together account for nearly twothirds of steel consumption operating rates at our steel mills for the full year 2020 decreased to 82 as compared to 84 for the full year 2019 industrywide the us capacity utilization rate was 68 for 2020 down from 80 in 2019 

economic conditions improved in the second half of 2020 and we are optimistic about market conditions heading into 2021 we expect the nonresidential construction and automotive markets to remain strong we hope to see improvement in markets like heavy duty trucks heavy equipment and agriculture that were down in 2020 we anticipate the recovery in oil and gas markets to be slow but nucor has seen increased sales into the renewable energy market

the section 232 steel tariffs continued to be effective in keeping unfairly traded imports out of the us market for the full year 2020 finished steel imports were down approximately 23 from the previous year and accounted for approximately 18 of us market share 

 

our challenges and risks 

sales of many of our products are largely dependent upon capital spending in the nonresidential construction markets in the united states including in the industrial and commercial sectors as well as capital spending on infrastructure that is publicly funded such as bridges schools prisons and hospitals while there has been no federal infrastructure bill in recent years many states have passed bills funding infrastructure improvements 

 

while the section 232 tariffs are having their intended impact by keeping unfairly traded imports out of the us market global steel production overcapacity continues to be a longterm challenge steel production in china rose in 2020 going from approximately 110 billion tons in 2019 to approximately 116 billion tons in 2020 – an increase of 55 as a result china’s share of global crude steel production rose from 533 in 2019 to 566 in 2020 the oecd projects that global excess steel production capacity was approximately 776 million tons in 2020 up from 624 million tons at the end of 2019  which was itself up significantly from the prior year 

a major uncertainty we continue to face in our business is the price of our principal raw material ferrous scrap which is volatile and often increases or decreases rapidly in response to changes in domestic demand unanticipated events that affect the flow of scrap into scrap yards the availability of scrap substitutes currency fluctuations and changes in foreign demand for scrap in periods of rapidly increasing raw material prices in the industry which are often also associated with periods of strong or rapidly improving steel market conditions being able to increase our prices for the products we sell quickly enough to offset increases in the prices we pay for ferrous scrap is challenging but critical to maintaining our profitability we attempt to mitigate the scrap price risk by managing scrap inventory levels at the steel mills to match the anticipated demand over the next several weeks certain scrap substitutes including pig iron have longer lead times for delivery than scrap which can make this inventory management strategy difficult to achieve continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj give us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus also helps us to mitigate this risk

during periods of stronger or improving steel market conditions we are more likely to be able to pass through to our customers relatively quickly the increased costs of ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes protecting our gross margins from significant erosion during weaker or rapidly deteriorating steel market conditions weak steel demand low industry utilization rates and the impact of imports create an even more intensified competitive environment and increased pricing pressure all of those factors to some degree impact pricing which increases the likelihood that nucor will experience lower gross margins

although the majority of our steel sales are to spot market customers in north america who place their orders each month based on their business needs and our pricing competitiveness compared to both domestic and global producers and trading companies we also sell contract tons most notably in our sheet operations approximately 70 of our sheet sales were to contract customers in 2020 75 in 2019 with the balance being sold in the spot market at the prevailing prices at the time of sale steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant the amount of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on the overall market conditions at the time how the enduse customers see the market moving forward and the strategy that nucor management believes is appropriate to the upcoming period

nucor management considerations include maintaining an appropriate balance of spot and contract tons based on market projections and appropriately supporting our diversified customer base the percentage of tons that is placed under contract also depends on the overall market dynamics and customer negotiations in years of strengthening demand we typically see an increase in the percentage of sheet sales sold under contract as our customers have an expectation that transaction prices will rapidly rise and available capacity will quickly be sold out to mitigate this risk customers prefer to enter into contracts in order to obtain committed volumes of supply from the mills the vast majority of our contracts include a method of adjusting prices on a periodic basis to reflect changes in the market pricing for steel andor scrap market indices for steel generally trend with scrap pricing changes but during periods of steel market weakness the more intensified competitive steel market environment can cause the sales price indices to decrease resulting in reduced gross margins and profitability furthermore since the selling price adjustments are not immediate there will always be a timing difference between changes in the prices we pay for raw materials and the adjustments we make to our contract selling prices generally in periods of increasing scrap prices we experience a shortterm margin contraction on 

 

contract tons conversely in periods of decreasing scrap prices we typically experience a shortterm margin expansion contract sales typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months 

our strengths and opportunities

we are north america’s most diversified steel producer as a result our shortterm performance is not tied to any one market we have numerous large strategic capital projects at various stages of progress that we believe will help us further diversify our product offerings and expand the markets that we serve we expect these investments to grow our longterm earnings power by increasing our channels to market expanding our product portfolio into higher valueadded offerings that are less vulnerable to imports improving our cost structure and further building upon our market leadership positions

we believe that nucor’s raw material supply chain is another important strength our investment in dri production facilities and scrap brokerage and processing businesses provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw materials costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control reduces risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a considerable portion of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that historically have experienced greater political turmoil

our highly variable lowcost structure combined with our financial strength and liquidity has allowed us to successfully navigate cyclical severely depressed steel industry market conditions in the past in such times our incentivebased pay system reduces our payroll costs both hourly and salary which helps to offset lower selling prices our payforperformance system that is closely tied to our levels of production also allows us to keep our highly experienced workforce intact and to continue operating our facilities when some of our competitors with greater fixed costs are forced to shut down some of their facilities because we use eafs to produce our steel we can easily vary our production levels to match shortterm changes in demand unlike our blast furnacebased integrated competitors we believe these strengths also provide us further opportunities to gain market share during such times

evaluating our operating performance

we report our results of operations in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials most of the steel we produce in our mills is sold to outside customers 80 in both 2020 and 2019 but a significant percentage is used internally by many of the facilities in our steel products segment 20 in both 2020 and 2019

we begin measuring our performance by comparing our net sales both in total and by individual segment during a reporting period with our net sales in the corresponding period in the prior year in doing so we focus on changes in and the reasons for such changes in the two key variables that have the greatest influence on our net sales average sales price per ton during the period and total tons shipped to outside customers

we also focus on both dollar and percentage changes in gross margins which are key drivers of our profitability and the reasons for such changes there are many factors from period to period that can affect our gross margins one consistent area of focus for us is changes in “metal margins” which is the difference between the selling price of steel and the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes increases or decreases in the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes that are not offset by changes in the selling price of steel can quickly compress or expand our margins and reduce or increase our profitability

changes in marketing administrative and other expenses particularly profit sharing and other variable incentivebased payment costs can have a material effect on our results of operations for a reporting period as well these costs vary significantly from period to period as they are based upon changes in our pretax earnings and other profitability metrics that are a reflection of our payforperformance system that is closely tied to our levels of production

 

evaluating our financial condition 

we evaluate our financial condition each reporting period by focusing primarily on the amounts of and reasons for changes in cash provided by operating activities our current ratio the turnover rate of our accounts receivable and inventories the amounts of and reasons for changes in cash used in or provided by investing activities including projected capital expenditures and financing activities and our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments position at period end we believe that our conservative financial practices have served us well in the past and are serving us well today as a result our financial position remains strong 

comparison of 2020 to 2019 

results of operations 

nucor reported consolidated net earnings of 236 per diluted share in 2020 and 414 per diluted share in 2019 the covid19 pandemic and the impacts it had on the domestic economy were the primary factor driving the decrease in earnings in 2020 as compared to 2019 

in 2019 the steel mills segment’s profitability peaked in the first quarter and experienced a downward trend for the remainder of the year primarily due to inventory destocking the first quarter of 2020 was off to a promising start for the steel mills segment building off of the momentum of price increases announced in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a strong quarterly utilization rate of 89 the first quarter of 2020 ended with the rapidly intensifying impact of the covid19 pandemic beginning to impact our business late in the quarter we also determined a triggering event occurred related to our equity method investment located in italy duferdofin nucor srl “duferdofin nucor” that would result in us reserving a note receivable and a significant impairment charge in the first quarter of 2020 we ultimately exited our investment in duferdofin nucor prior to the end of the year total losses and impairments of assets related to duferdofin nucor that were included in the steel mills segment earnings were approximately 4835 million in 2020 we also recorded additional impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to certain inventory and longlived assets of 1032 million that were primarily related to our castrip sheet operations

the steel mills segment performance bottomed in the second quarter of 2020 but had an upward trajectory for the remainder of the year our steel mills segment is expected to have a very strong first quarter of 2021 due to increases in steel selling prices and strengthening market conditions at the end of 2020 

nonresidential construction market conditions were strong in 2019 and 2020the resiliency of nonresidential construction markets during the covid19 pandemic paved the way for our steel products segment to have record profitability in 2020 surpassing the previous record set in 2019 many of our business units in this segment performed at record or nearrecord levels with our rebar fabrication and tubular products businesses driving the yearoveryear increase for the segment in addition to the strength of nonresidential construction markets over the last two years the steel products segment continues to benefit from the lasting effects of changes in business strategy and efficiency initiatives that have significantly improved the performance of our rebar fabrication operations and metal buildings business 

the raw materials segment’s profitability in 2020 increased from 2019 primarily due to the improved performance of our dri facilities our dri facility in louisiana experienced a planned 70day outage in 2019 to enhance operational reliability and the facility set new records for production shipping and operating hours in 2020 low average selling prices and higher iron ore costs have caused the dri facilities to have combined operating losses in 2020 and 2019 however selling prices for raw materials increased dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2020 and we expect strong performance for the raw materials segment in the first quarter of 2021 

the raw materials segment incurred noncash impairment charges of 270 million and 350 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the 2020 charges related to our leasehold interest in unproved oil and gas properties and the 2019 charges related to our proved oil and gas properties refer to “critical accounting policies and estimates” for further discussion of these charges

 

nucor’s income tax provision in 2020 benefited from several notable items that are not included in segment reporting of note the 2020 tax provision benefited from 2019 million related to certain tax deductions claimed related to our now exited investment in duferdofin nucor 397 million related to certain state tax credits and 482 million related to the anticipated carryback of a 2020 tax net operating loss under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” 

the following discussion will provide greater quantitative and qualitative analysis of nucor’s performance in 2020 as compared to 2019 net sales 

net sales to external customers by segment for 2020 and 2019 were as follows in thousands

 



 

net sales for 2020 decreased 11 from the prior year average sales price per ton decreased 7 from 851 in 2019 to 789 in 2020 total tons shipped to outside customers decreased 4 from 26532000 tons in 2019 to 25519000 in 2020

in the steel mills segment sales tons were as follows in thousands

 



 

net sales for the steel mills segment decreased 13 in 2020 from the prior year due to a 10 decrease in the average sales price per ton from 748 in 2019 to 671 in 2020 as well as a 3 decrease in total tons shipped to outside customers 

outside sales tonnage for the steel products segment was as follows in thousands

 



 

net sales for the steel products segment decreased 5 in 2020 from the prior year due to a 5 decrease in average sales price per ton 

net sales for the raw materials segment decreased 15 in 2020 from the prior year primarily due to decreased average selling prices at djj’s brokerage operations and decreased volumes at djj’s scrap processing operations and brokerage operations in 2020 approximately 88 of outside sales for the raw 

 

materials segment were from the brokerage operations of djj and approximately 9 of outside sales were from the scrap processing operations of djj 90 and 9 respectively in 2019 

gross margins

in 2020 nucor recorded gross margins of 223 billion 11 which was a decrease from 268 billion 12 in 2019



 

scrap prices are driven by the global supply and demand for scrap and other ironbased raw materials used to make steel scrap prices decreased during most of 2020 but began to rapidly increase late in the year as we enter 2021 we see downward pressure on scrap prices in the near term that we believe is likely to stabilize and follow a more typical seasonal pattern during the remainder of the year 

 



 





gross margins related to djj’s brokerage operations decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to margin compression and decreased volumes gross margins for djj’s scrap processing operations slightly increased in 2020

marketing administrative and other expenses

a major component of marketing administrative and other expenses is profit sharing and other incentive compensation costs these costs which are based upon and fluctuate with nucor’s financial performance decreased from 2019 to 2020 due to our decreased profitability in 2020 in 2020 profit sharing costs consisted of 866 million of contributions including the company’s matching contribution made to the company’s profit sharing and retirement savings plan for qualified employees 1814 million in 2019 other employee bonus costs also fluctuate based on nucor’s achievement of certain financial performance goals including achieving record earnings and comparisons of nucor’s financial performance to peers in the steel industry and other companies stockbased compensation included in marketing administrative and other expenses decreased by 21 to 292 million in 2020 compared with 369 million in 2019 and includes costs associated with vesting of stock awards granted in prior years

included in marketing administrative and other expenses in 2020 was 182 million of restructuring charges related to the realignment of nucor’s metal buildings business in the steel products segment 

 

included in marketing administrative and other expenses in 2019 was a benefit of 337 million related to the gain on the sale of an equity method investment in the raw materials segment 

equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated affiliates

equity method investment losses and earnings were 105 million in 2020 and 33 million in 2019 the decrease in equity method investment earnings from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to the decreased results of nucorjfe and numit losses and impairments of assets 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 nucor performed an impairment analysis of its three fields of proved producing natural gas well assets and determined that the carrying amount of one of the fields of wells exceeded its fair value and the impairment condition was considered to be other than temporary this field of wells was not impaired as a result of the analysis performed in 2018 nucor recorded a 350 million noncash impairment charge against this field of wells driven primarily by estimated lease operating costs that were higher than the estimates used in the 2018 analysis these charges were included in the raw materials segment see note 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nucor recorded additional impairment charges in 2019 of 200 million related to certain property plant and equipment in the steel mills segment and 119 million related to the writedown of certain intangible assets in the steel products segment

in 2020 nucor recorded losses on assets of 4835 million related to our equity method investment in duferdofin nucor nucor also recorded impairment charges in 2020 of 1032 million related to certain inventory and longlived assets in the steel mills segment and 270 million related to the writedown of our unproved natural gas well assets included in the raw materials segment

interest expense income

net interest expense is detailed below in thousands

 



 

interest expense increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a higher average outstanding debt balance interest income decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to significantly lower average interest rates on investments

earnings loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 

the following table presents earnings loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests by segment for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in thousands the change between periods were driven by the quantitative and qualitative factors previously discussed

 



 

 

noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests represent the income attributable to the noncontrolling partners of nucor’s joint ventures primarily nucor–yamato of which nucor owns 51 the 15 increase in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the increased earnings of nucor–yamato under the nucor–yamato limited partnership agreement the minimum amount of cash to be distributed each year to the partners is the amount needed by each partner to pay applicable us federal and state income taxes in 2020 the amount of cash distributed to noncontrolling interest holders exceeded the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests based on mutual agreement of the general partners however the cumulative amount of cash distributed to partners was less than the cumulative net earnings of the partnership

provision for income taxes

the company’s effective tax rate in 2020 was 006 compared with 231 in 2019 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a net tax benefit of 2019 million 2416 for a tax loss on our investment in duferdofin nucor a net tax benefit of 452 million 541 for state tax credits and a federal tax benefit of 482 million 577 for the carryback of a federal tax net operating loss an “nol” under the cares act these benefits were all recognized in 2020 and were somewhat offset by the rate impact 112 of financial statement impairments of 4456 million which did not affect the provision for income taxes the cares act allows for an nol generated in 2020 to be carried back to taxable years where the federal income tax rate was 35 the difference in the tax rate in 2020 and tax years before the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 is the main driver of the federal tax nol benefit in 2020 but this is somewhat offset by the partial loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction in the carryback year

nucor has concluded us federal income tax matters for tax years through 2014 and for tax year 2016 the tax years 2015 and 2017 through 2019 remain open to examination by the internal revenue service the 2015 canadian income tax returns for harris steel group inc and certain related affiliates are currently under examination by the canada revenue agency the tax years 2014 through 2019 remain open to examination by other major taxing jurisdictions to which nucor is subject primarily canada and other state and local jurisdictions

net earnings and return on equity

nucor reported net earnings of 7215 million or 236 per diluted share in 2020 compared to net earnings of 127 billion or 414 per diluted share in 2019 net earnings attributable to nucor stockholders as a percentage of net sales were 36 and 56 in 2020 and 2019 respectively return on average stockholders’ equity was 68 and 126 in 2020 and 2019 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the significant uncertainty it had on nucor and our stakeholders we instituted enterprisewide efforts to enhance our liquidity and support our teammates which include among other things





 



nucor’s cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and cash equivalents position remained strong at 316 billion at december 31 2020 compared with 183 billion as of december 31 2019 approximately 3160 million and 3544 million of the cash and cash equivalents position at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively was held by our majorityowned joint ventures cash flows provided by operating activities provide us with a significant source of liquidity when needed we have external shortterm financing sources available including the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under our bank credit facilities 

we also issue longterm debt securities from time to time to further enhance our liquidity nucor took advantage of attractive market conditions during the second quarter of 2020 to issue low coupon debt in the form of longterm notes in may nucor issued 5000 million of 2000 notes due 2025 and 5000 million of 2700 notes due 2030 additionally in july nucor became an obligor with respect to 1626 million in 40year variablerate green bonds to partially fund the capital costs associated with the construction of our plate mill located in brandenburg kentucky proceeds of the green bonds are held on nucor’s balance sheet as restricted cash and cash equivalents until they are utilized in connection with the construction of the plate mill in brandenburg kentucky

in december 2020 nucor exchanged 1067 million of its 6400 notes due 2037 1619 million of its 5200 notes due 2043 and 1708 million of its 4400 notes due 2048 with holders of the existing notes for 4393 million of its 2979 notes due 2055 and a cash component of 1803 million this exchange transaction has been accounted for as a modification and as such the cash component of 1803 million has been capitalized as a reduction of longterm debt and is being amortized into interest expense over the life of the new notes 

nucor’s 150 billion revolving credit facility is undrawn and was amended and restated in april 2018 to extend the maturity date to april 2023 we believe our financial strength is a key strategic advantage among domestic steel producers particularly during recessionary business cycles we carry the highest credit ratings of any steel producer headquartered in north america with an a longterm rating from standard and poor’s and a baa1 longterm rating from moody’s our credit ratings are dependent however upon a number of factors both qualitative and quantitative and are subject to change at any time the disclosure of our credit ratings is made in order to enhance investors’ understanding of our sources of liquidity and the impact of our credit ratings on our cost of funds based upon the preceding factors we expect to continue to have adequate access to the capital markets at a reasonable cost of funds for liquidity purposes when needed  

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources

 



 

the current ratio which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities was 36 at yearend 2020 compared with 33 at yearend 2019 the current ratio was positively impacted by the 66 increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments the increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was a result of the issuance of 5000 million of 2000 notes 

 

due 2025 and 5000 million of 2700 notes due 2030 and robust cash provided by operations during 2020 

in 2020 total accounts receivable turned approximately every six weeks and inventories turned approximately every 11 weeks these ratios compare with accounts receivable turnover of approximately every five weeks and inventory turnover of approximately every 11 weeks in 2019

funds provided by operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments restricted cash and cash equivalents and new borrowings under existing credit facilities are expected to be adequate to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements for existing operations for at least the next 24 months additionally nucor has no significant debt maturities until september 2022

offbalance sheet arrangements

we have a simple capital structure with no offbalance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated special purpose entities that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity

capital allocation strategy

we believe that our conservative financial practices have served us well in the past and are serving us well today nucor’s financial strength allows for a consistent balanced approach to capital allocation throughout the business cycle nucor’s highest capital allocation priority is to reinvest in our business to ensure our continued profitable growth over the long term we have historically done this by investing to optimize our existing operations initiate greenfield expansions and make acquisitions our second priority is to return capital to our stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases we intend to return a minimum of 40 of our net earnings to our stockholders while maintaining a debttocapital ratio that supports a strong investment grade credit rating the company repurchased 395 million of shares of its common stock in 2020 2985 million in 2019 and 8540 million in 2018 

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities was 270 billion in 2020 as compared to 281 billion in 2019 net earnings declined by 5349 million over the prior year which included 6136 million of noncash losses and impairments of assets related to our equity method investment in duferdofin nucor impairment of certain inventory and longlived assets in the steel mills segment and a writedown of our unproved natural gas well assets in the raw materials segment 669 million of noncash losses and impairments of assets in 2019 additionally the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the 2093 million reduction of cash provided by operating assets and operating liabilities changes in operating assets and operating liabilities exclusive of acquisitions and dispositions provided cash of 2040 million in 2020 as compared to 4133 million in 2019 the funding of working capital increased in 2020 over the prior year mainly due to increases in accounts receivable and a more moderate decrease in inventory from yearend 2019 to the end of 2020 as compared to the same prior year period offset by an increase in accounts payable and a more moderate cash outflow related to salaries wages and related accruals accounts receivable at the end of 2020 increased from prior yearend due to a 25 increase in composite sales price from yearend 2019 to yearend 2020 inventories decreased by 2730 million due to a 13 decrease in inventory tons as compared to inventories decreasing by 7114 million due to a 22 decline in average scrap and scrap substitutes cost per ton in inventory and a 9 decline in total inventory tons on hand in the prior year period inventory tons reduction especially scrap was a particular focus due to uncertainty from the covid19 pandemic beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and our investment in inventory at the end of 2020 continued to decline from prior quarterend levels accounts payable increased due to the increase in average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton mentioned previously finally the decrease in cash used to fund salaries wages and related accruals in 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to the timing of incentive compensation payments and lower current year profit sharing accruals due to the decreased profitability of the company the 2019 payments were based on nucor’s financial performance in 2018 which was a record earnings year

 

investing activities 

our business is capital intensive therefore cash used in investing activities primarily represents capital expenditures for new facilities the expansion and upgrading of existing facilities and the acquisition of other companies cash used in investing activities in 2020 was 176 billion as compared to 179 billion in 2019 cash used for capital expenditures was relatively flat from the prior year 154 billion in 2020 as opposed to 148 billion in 2019 the primary drivers of capital expenditures were related to the sheet mill expansion at nucor steel gallatin the flex galvanizing line at nucor steel arkansas the new micro mill greenfield expansion in frostproof florida and the new plate mill in brandenburg kentucky also impacting cash used in investing activities in 2020 was the purchase of 4885 million of investments as opposed to 3677 million in the prior year these purchases were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investments of 3922 million in 2020 and 677 million in 2019 additionally 2019 benefited from cash provided by the divestiture of an affiliate of 676 million related to the sale of an equity method investment

financing activities

cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was 2859 million as compared to cash used in financing activities of 8804 million in 2019 the majority of this change related to the debt issuance discussed previously as well as nucor becoming an obligor with respect to 1626 million in 40year variable rate green bonds to partially fund the capital costs associated with the construction of our plate mill located in brandenburg kentucky there were also approximately 395 million of stock repurchases in 2020 all in the first quarter as compared to 2985 million in 2019 in addition in the fourth quarter of 2020 1804 million of cash was used for payment of premiums on the debt exchange where nucor issued 4392 million of its new 2979 notes due 2055 in exchange for certain of its existing notes finally in the first quarter of 2020 one of the remarketing agents for nucor’s industrial development revenue bonds “idrbs” put a portion of two bonds to us resulting in repayment of 320 million in longterm debt we subsequently remarketed the bonds and received 320 million in proceeds nucor’s idrbs are variablerate taxexempt bonds which have interest rates that reset on a weekly basis through an ongoing remarketing process we expect our bonds to be successfully placed with investors at the market driven rates in the future however there have been times in severe economic downturns as was the case during the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the economic impacts of covid19 that a remarketing agent is unable to remarket nucor’s bonds successfully and is unwilling to temporarily hold the bonds in that situation which has been rare in our experience it is possible that the bonds could be put back to us in the future in this instance during the first quarter of 2020 the idrbs were remarketed successfully in a short period of time however in the event of a prolonged failed remarketing we have among other options availability under our 150 billion revolving credit facility to repurchase the idrbs until they are remarketed successfully in general nucor has the ability and intent to refinance the idrb debt on a longterm basis therefore we classify the idrbs as a longterm liability the remaining 652 million of debt that was repaid during 2020 was related to a different tranche of nucor’s idrbs that was repurchased as part of our investment strategy and the payoff of a series of idrbs that matured during the third quarter

our undrawn revolving credit facility includes only one financial covenant which is a limit of 60 on the ratio of funded debt to total capitalization in addition the undrawn revolving credit facility contains customary nonfinancial covenants including a limit on nucor’s ability to pledge the company’s assets and a limit on consolidations mergers and sales of assets our funded debt to total capital ratio was 32 at the end of 2020 and 29 at the end of 2019 and we were in compliance with all other covenants under our undrawn revolving credit facility at the end of 2020

market risk

nucor’s largest exposure to market risk is in our steel mills and steel products segments our utilization rates for the steel mills and steel products facilities for the fourth quarter of 2020 were 87 and 71 respectively a significant portion of our steel mills and steel products segments’ sales are into the commercial industrial and municipal construction markets our largest single customer in 2020 represented less than 5 of sales and consistently pays within terms in the raw materials segment we are exposed to price fluctuations related to the purchase of scrap steel pig iron and iron ore our exposure to market risk is mitigated by the fact that our steel mills use a significant portion of the products of this segment

 

nucor’s taxexempt idrbs have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly these idrbs represented 2 2  of nucor’s longterm debt outstanding at december 31 20 20  the remaining 7 8  of nucor’s longterm debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings from time to time nucor makes use of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk as of december 31 20 20  there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to partially manage its exposure to price risk related to purchases of natural gas used in the production process as well as scrap copper and aluminum purchased for resale to its customers in addition nucor uses forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time to hedge cash flows associated with certain assets and liabilities firm commitments and anticipated transactions nucor generally does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than hedging the cash flows associated with specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in future periods and hedging the exposures related to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixedrate debt instruments and foreign currency transactions nucor recognizes all derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada and mexico we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations

dividends

nucor has increased its base cash dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 1973 nucor paid dividends of 161 per share in 2020 compared with 160 per share in 2019 in december 2019 the board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend on nucor’s common stock to 0405 per share over the past 10 years nucor has returned approximately 600 billion in capital to its stockholders in the form of base dividends and share repurchases in february 2021 the board of directors declared nucor’s 192 nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend of 0405 per share payable on may 11 2021 to stockholders of record on march 31 2021

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december 31 2020 for the periods presented in thousands

 



 





 







note in addition to the amounts shown in the table above 480 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled related to these unrecognized tax benefits we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of 120 million at december 31 2020

outlook 

in 2021 we will continue to take advantage of our position of strength to grow nucor’s longterm earnings power and stockholder value by continuing to successfully focus on profitable growth strategies we have invested significant capital over a broad range of strategic acquisitions and investments that we believe will further enhance our ability to grow nucor’s longterm earnings power by increasing our channels to market expand our product portfolios into higher valueadded offerings that are less vulnerable to imports improve our highly variable lowcost structure build upon our market leadership positions and achieve commercial excellence we are utilizing nucor’s financial strength to execute on investment opportunities to further grow our longterm earnings capacity

 

we expect nucor’s earnings in the first quarter of 2021 to increase significantly as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 we expect a very significant increase in earnings in the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 excluding the fourth quarter of 2020 impairment charges due to price increases that were announced in the fourth quarter of 2020 and expected higher volumes we expect the profitability of the steel products segment in the first quarter of 2021 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2020 we expect the performance of the raw materials segment to significantly increase in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to an improvement in pricing for raw materials and the absence of the impairment charge related to our unproved natural gas assets taken in 2020 

as we begin 2021 we see key economic indicators rebounding and stable or improving market conditions in 23 of the 24 steel intensive enduse markets that we monitor we believe that full year domestic steel demand will experience modest growth in 2021 as compared to 2020 backlog volumes in both the steel mills and steel products segments were significantly higher at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019

we are ever mindful of the threat of increases in imported steel stemming from the still significant excess foreign steel capacity the section 232 tariffs are having their intended impact by taking artificially lowcost foreign imports out of the us market over the past decade the steel industry has won several important trade cases that addressed unfairly traded imports prior to the imposition of the section 232 tariffs the cumulative impact of those trade case victories also took a sizeable amount of unfairly traded imports out of the market and those duties will remain in the event the section 232 tariffs are lifted

 

we are committed to executing on the opportunities we see ahead to reward nucor stockholders with very attractive longterm returns on their valuable capital invested in our company our industryleading financial strength allows us to support investments in our facilities that we believe will enable us to generate increased profitability in 2021 as we have in our past we will allocate capital to investments that we believe will build our longterm earnings power capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately 200 billion in 2021 and we will be very focused on ensuring that these investments generate appropriate returns

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to the valuation allowances for receivables the carrying value of noncurrent assets and reserves for environmental obligations and income taxes our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources accordingly actual costs could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

allowances for doubtful accounts

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required

inventories

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the company records any amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value as a charge to cost of products sold scrap and scrap substitute costs are a very significant component of the raw material semifinished and finished product inventory balances the vast majority of the company’s inventory is recorded on the firstin firstout method production costs are applied to semifinished and finished product inventory from the approximate period in which they are produced

if steel selling prices were to decline in future quarters writedowns of inventory could result specifically the valuation of raw material inventories purchased during periods of peak market pricing would most likely be impacted low utilization rates at our steel mills or raw materials facilities could hinder our ability to work through highpriced scrap and scrap substitutes particularly pig iron and iron ore leading to periodend exposure when comparing carrying value to net realizable value

longlived asset impairments

we evaluate our property plant and equipment and finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment on an individual asset basis or at the lowest level asset grouping for which cash flows can be independently identified asset impairments are assessed whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets could exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows in developing estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations we utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce when it is determined that an impairment exists the related assets are written down to estimated fair market value

certain longlived asset groupings were tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2020 undiscounted cash flows for each asset grouping were estimated using management’s longrange estimates of market conditions associated with each asset grouping over the estimated useful life of the principal asset within the group our undiscounted cash flow analysis indicated that other than the groupings discussed below the tested longlived asset groupings were recoverable as of december 31 2020 however if our projected cash flows are not realized either because of an extended recessionary period or other unforeseen events impairment charges may be required in future periods a 13 decrease in the projected cash flows of each of our asset groupings would not result in an impairment 

 

 

steel mills segment asset impairments

 

in 2019 nucor recorded a noncash impairment charge of 200 million related to certain property plant and equipment at our plate mill in texas this charge is included in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 

 

in 2020 nucor recorded noncash impairment charges totaling 1032 million related to certain inventory and longlived assets which primarily related to our castrip sheet mill operations due to the advancements in the capabilities at our new cold mill and galvanizing line we have under construction at nucor steel arkansas we believe the value of the technology and process has diminished for nucor as such the existing castrip assets are not expected to be materially utilized going forward these charges are included in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2020

 

raw materials segment asset impairments

 

in the third quarter of 2018 due to the deteriorating natural gas pricing environment at our sales point in the piceance basin nucor determined a triggering event had occurred and performed an impairment analysis that resulted in 1100 million of noncash impairment charges relating to two of its three groups “fields” of wells in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the deteriorating natural gas pricing environment at our sales point in the piceance basin as well as the decreased performance of the natural gas well assets nucor determined a triggering event had occurred and performed an impairment analysis on all three fields of wells as a result of the fourth quarter of 2019 analysis a 350 million noncash impairment charge was recorded on the field of wells that was not previously impaired in the third quarter of 2018 an increase in the estimated lease operating cost projections was the primary factor in causing this field of wells to be impaired the noncash impairment charges are included in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

 

one of the main assumptions that most significantly affects the undiscounted cash flows determination is management’s estimate of future pricing of natural gas and natural gas liquids the pricing used in the impairment assessments was developed by management based on projected natural gas market supply and demand dynamics in conjunction with a review of projections by market analysts management also makes key estimates on the expected reserve levels and on the expected lease operating costs the impairment assessments were performed on each of nucor’s three fields of wells with each field defined by common geographic location the combined carrying value of the three fields of wells was 717 million at december 31 2020 789 million at december 31 2019

 

changes in the natural gas industry or a prolonged lowprice environment beyond what had already been assumed in the assessments could cause management to revise the natural gas and natural gas liquids price assumptions the estimated reserves or the estimated lease operating costs unfavorable revisions to these assumptions or estimates could possibly result in further impairment of some or all of the fields of proved well assets

in 2020 regulatory authorities in colorado adopted new rules that became effective january 2021 one of these rules increases drilling setback distances in the fourth quarter of 2020 nucor determined a triggering event had occurred as we do not expect to be able to access the full extent of the resources in the ground and performed an impairment analysis as a result nucor recorded a 270 million noncash impairment charge related to the writedown of our leasehold interest in unproved oil and gas properties this charge is included in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2020

goodwill and intangibles

goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred we perform our annual 

 

impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the recorded value including goodwill 

when appropriate nucor performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for certain reporting units it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis in these instances a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of these reporting units significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as part of our annual testing and any required interim testing include i expected cash flow for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices raw materials and other costs to produce and estimated capital needs ii an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit iii a discount rate based on management’s best estimate of the aftertax weightedaverage cost of capital and iv a probabilityweighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence management considers historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate

our fourth quarter 2020 annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge management does not believe that future impairment of these reporting units is probable however the performance of certain businesses that comprise our reporting units requires continued improvement an increase of approximately 50 basis points in the discount rate a critical assumption in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value would not result in an impairment charge see note 8 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the results of the company’s 2020 annual goodwill impairment analysis

nucor will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout 2021 in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual qualitative andor quantitative impairment test during our fourth quarter of 2021 changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill

equity method investments

investments in joint ventures in which nucor shares control over the financial and operating decisions but in which nucor is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method each of the company’s equity method investments is subject to a review for impairment if and when circumstances indicate that a decline in value below its carrying amount may have occurred examples of such circumstances include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in the earnings performance or business prospects of the investee missed financial projections a significant adverse change in the regulatory tax economic or technological environment of the investee a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates and recurring negative cash flows from operations when management considers the decline to be other than temporary the company would write down the related investment to its estimated fair market value an otherthantemporary decline in carrying value is determined to have occurred when in management’s judgment a decline in fair value below carrying value is of such length of time andor severity that it is considered longterm

in the event that an impairment review is necessary we calculate the estimated fair value of our equity method investments using a probabilityweighted multiplescenario income approach management’s analysis includes three discounted cash flow scenarios best case base case and recessionary case which contain forecasted nearterm cash flows under each scenario generally i the best case scenario contains estimates of future results ranging from slightly higher than recent operating performance to levels that are consistent with historical operating and financial performance ii the base case scenario contains estimates of future results ranging from generally in line with recent operating performance to levels that are more conservative than historical operating and financial performance and iii the recessionary case scenario contains estimates of future results which include limited growth resulting only from operational cost improvements and limited benefits of new highervalue product offerings management determines the probability that each cash flow scenario will come to fruition based 

 

on the specific facts and circumstances of each of the preceding scenarios with the base case typically receiving the majority of the weighting 

key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our equity method investments include i expected cash flow for the sixyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs ii an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the investment iii a discount rate based on management’s best estimate of the aftertax weightedaverage cost of capital and iv a probabilityweighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence while the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include projected revenues metal margins and discount rate the assumptions are often interdependent and no single factor predominates in determining the estimated fair value management considers historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its investments are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate

nucor determined that a triggering event occurred in the first quarter of 2020 with respect to its equity method investment in duferdofin nucor due to adverse developments in the joint venture’s commercial outlook which were exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic all of which negatively impacted the joint venture’s strategic direction after completing its impairment assessment nucor determined that the carrying amount exceeded its estimated fair value and the impairment condition was considered to be other than temporary therefore nucor recorded a 2500 million impairment charge in the first quarter of 2020 the assumptions that most significantly affected the fair value determination included projected cash flows and the discount rate the companyspecific inputs for measuring fair value are considered “level 3” or unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data under applicable fair value authoritative guidance as quoted market prices are not available

throughout 2020 additional capital contributions were made by the company to duferdofin nucor that were immediately impaired these additional capital contributions resulted in 50 million 66 million and 254 million impairment charges against our investment in duferdofin nucor in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 respectively also in the fourth quarter of 2020 nucor reclassified into earnings 1586 million of cumulative foreign currency translation losses on our investment in duferdofin nucor in 2020 total impairment charges including the aforementioned note receivable related to our investment in duferdofin nucor were approximately 4835 million these noncash impairment charges are included in the steel mills segment and in losses and impairments of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2020

environmental remediation

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal state and local authorities and we make provisions for the estimated costs related to compliance undiscounted remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures the accruals are reviewed periodically and as investigations and remediation proceed adjustments are made as we believe are necessary our measurement of environmental liabilities is based on currently available facts present laws and regulations and current technology

income taxes

we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes under the liability method deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations are recognized as a component of interest expense and other expenses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them

interest rate risk – nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2020 approximately 22 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly the remaining 78 of nucor’s longterm debt was at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2020 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk – in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in periods of strong or stable demand for our products we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for our products is weaker this becomes more challenging our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs dri is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic steel production 

natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states 

nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in net earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2020 accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes included 47 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of the derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2020 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands

 



 

any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities

foreign currency risk – nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and mexico we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2020 and 2019 were insignificant

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada and mexico the steel mills segment sold approximately 18585000 tons to outside customers in 2019 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following chart shows our outside steel shipments by end market 

in 2019 80 of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers the remaining 20 of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our tubular products piling distributor joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 



steel produced by our bar mills has a wide usage serving end markets including the agricultural automotive construction energy furniture machinery metal building railroad recreational equipment shipbuilding heavy truck and trailer market segments considering nucor’s production capabilities and the mix of bar products generally produced and marketed the capacity of the bar mills is currently estimated at approximately 8830000 tons per year

reinforcing and merchant bar steel are sold in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders our sbq products are hotrolled to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors



nucor produces hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized sheet steel to customers’ specifications while maintaining some inventories to fulfill anticipated orders contract sales within the steel mills segment are most notable in our sheet operations as it is common for contract sales to account for the majority of sheet sales in a given year we estimate that approximately 75 of our sheet steel sales in 2019 were to contract customers the balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale the proportion of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors including our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons in a manner to meet our customers’ requirements while considering the expected profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse 

 

customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts are generally noncancellable agreements that incorporate monthly or quarterly price adjustments reflect ing changes in the current marketbased indices andor raw material cost  and typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months  



structural steel products come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders



in january 2019 nucor announced that it will build a stateoftheart plate mill to be located in brandenburg kentucky nucor steel brandenburg will be located on the ohio river and well placed to serve the us midwest which is the largest plateconsuming area in the united states the new plate mill will enhance our ability to serve our customers and will produce cuttolength coiled heattreated and discrete plate in widths and thicknesses that are not currently offered by nucor with an expected investment of 170 billion the mill is expected to have an annual capacity of approximately 1200000 tons and is expected to be completed in 2022

plate steel products come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders



nucor owns a 50 economic and voting interest in numit a company that owns 100 of the equity interest in steel technologies llc “steel technologies” an operator of 26 strategically located sheet processing facilities in the united states canada and mexico steel technologies transforms flatrolled steel into products that meet the exact specifications for customers in a wide range of industries including the automotive agricultural and consumer goods markets

reinforcing products are essential to concrete construction they supply tensile strength as well as additional compressive strength and protect the concrete from cracking in many markets harris sells reinforcing products on an installed basis ie harris fabricates the reinforcing products for a specific application and performs the installation harris operates nearly 70 fabrication facilities across the united states and canada with each facility serving a local market total annual rebar fabrication capacity is approximately 1650000 tons



sales of steel joists joist girders and steel decking are dependent on the nonresidential building construction market the majority of steel joists joist girders and steel decking are used extensively as part of the roof and floor structural support systems in manufacturing buildings retail stores shopping centers warehouses schools hospitals and to a lesser extent in multistory buildings and apartments we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not sell these finished steel products out of inventory the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longerterm supply contracts may or may not permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs



 





nucor’s cold finished facilities are among the most modern in the world producing cold finished bars for the most demanding applications ncf obtains most of its steel from the nucor bar mills ensuring consistent quality and supply through all market conditions these facilities produce colddrawn turned ground and polished steel bars that are used extensively for shafting and other precision machined applications ncf produces rounds hexagons flats and squares in carbon alloy and leaded steels these bars are purchased by the appliance automotive construction equipment electric motor farm machinery and fluid power industries as well as by service centers ncf bars are used in tens of thousands of products a few examples include anchor bolts hydraulic cylinders and shafting for air conditioner compressors ceiling fan motors garage door openers electric motors and lawn mowers

in late 2018 nucor acquired a fully integrated precision castings company corporacion pok sa de cv “pok” with a facility in guadalajara mexico pok produces complex castings and precision machined products used by the oil and gas mining and sugar processing industries pok produces a wide array of precision castings using steel bronze iron and specialty exotic alloys pok complements ncf’s businesses and nucor’s cold finish facility in monterrey



the sizes of the buildings that can be produced range from less than 1000 square feet to more than 1000000 square feet complete metal building packages can be customized and combined with other materials such as glass wood and masonry to produce costeffective energy efficient aesthetically pleasing buildings designed to the customers’ special requirements the buildings are sold primarily through independent builder distribution networks in order to provide fasttrack customized solutions for building owners the primary markets served are commercial industrial and institutional buildings including distribution centers data centers automobile dealerships retail centers schools and manufacturing facilities 



nucor produces mesh at nucor steel connecticut inc and nucor wire products utah nucor also produces mesh in canada at the harris operations of laurel and laurellec the combined annual production capacity of the steel mesh facilities is approximately 128000 tons

our grating business which operates under the brand names nucor grating in the united states and fisher  ludlow in canada manufactures and fabricates steel and aluminum bar grating products at facilities located in north america nucor grating and fisher  ludlow serve the new construction and maintenancerelated markets the annual production capacity for our grating business is approximately 120000 tons

raw materials segment 

in the raw materials segment nucor produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas drilling operations nucor’s raw materials investments are focused on creating an advantage for its steelmaking operations through a global information network and a multipronged and flexible approach to metallics supply



djj is the leading broker of ferrous scrap in north america and is a global trader of scrap metal pig iron and other metallics in addition to sourcing steel scrap for nucor’s mills djj is a global trader of ferroalloys and nonferrous metals djj’s logistics team owns and operates one of the largest independent fleets of railcars in the united states dedicated to the movement of scrap and steel and also offers railcar leasing and railcar fleet management services these activities have strategic value to nucor as the leading and most diversified north american steel producer

our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are eaf steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2019 approximately 10 of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitute tons we processed were sold to external customers we consumed the balance in our steel mills



nucor’s dri production capabilities provide our steel mills flexibility to quickly adjust the metallic mix to changing market conditions and to maintain competitiveness in the sometimesvolatile scrap market with the potential for highquality scrap becoming scarcer coupled with the risk of thirdparty supplier disruptions nucor’s dri facilities provide a greater degree of certainty over its metallics supply

in early 2018 teammates at our nucor steel louisiana facility began implementation of a threepronged strategy to increase the plants reliability and uptime called project 8000 the plan focuses on achieving improvements in people process and equipment the louisiana dri facility established new annual records for plant uptime production and shipments in 2018 as improvements related to people and processes were implemented in 2019 the critical work of replacing the convection section of our process gas heater as well as relining the reactor refractory was completed during a planned 70day outage that began in earlyseptember and ended in midnovember despite this outage 2019 was the secondbest year for uptime and output at nucor steel louisiana since its startup in 2013 we expect these projects will further improve the plant’s reliability



nucor’s access to a longterm lowcost supply of natural gas is an important component in the execution of nucor’s raw material strategy natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations 

 

is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our dri plant in louisiana and our steel mills in the united states 

customers 

a significant portion of our steel mills and steel products segments’ sales are into the commercial industrial and municipal construction markets our largest single customer in 2019 represented approximately 5 of sales and consistently pays within terms our steel mills use a significant portion of the products of the raw materials segment 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to expand our product portfolio to include more valueadded steel mill products improve our cost structure enhance our operational flexibility and provide additional channels to market for our products these investments totaled approximately 368 billion over the last three years with approximately 80 going to capital expenditures and the remaining going to acquisitions we believe that our focus on lowering costs and diversifying our operations will enable us to execute on our strategy of delivering profitable longterm growth further we believe shifting our product mix to a greater proportion of valueadded products and increasing enduse market diversity will make us less susceptible to imports

new capital projects that align with our expansion of valueadded product offerings and costreduction strategies were completed in 2019 at our sheet mill located in ghent kentucky nucor’s approximately 200 million investment in a new hot band galvanizing and pickling line ramped up production in late 2019 and is shipping products to customers we believe the new galvanizing line is the widest hotrolled galvanizing line in north america with its 72inch product creating synergies with nucor’s other sheet mills and allowing us to enter new automotive market segments our nucor steel arkansas facility built an additional specialty cold mill for approximately 245 million that began start up in 2019 that cold mill facility expands our ability to produce advanced highstrength lowalloy steel and motor lamination steel products

we have several growth initiatives underway in our bar mill group that will enhance our position as a lowcost producer of bar nucor’s rebar micro mill near kansas city in sedalia missouri is capable of producing approximately 380000 tons annually and was completed at a cost of approximately 245 million we believe that positioning the micro mill near the kansas city market will provide us with a freight cost advantage relative to more distant suppliers and we will also benefit from the scrap supply in the immediate area provided by our existing djj operations the new mill went into startup in early 2020 nucor steel kankakee inc is building a fullrange merchant bar quality mill with approximately 500000 tons of annual capacity at our existing mill in bourbonnais illinois at an estimated cost of 185 million like the new micro mill we believe that the kankakee mill will also benefit from logistical advantages and lowcost scrap supply we expect this project to begin startup in the second quarter of 2020 in march 2018 nucor announced that it would build a second rebar micro mill capable of producing approximately 380000 tons annually in frostproof florida similar to the mill in sedalia missouri we believe this new micro mill will benefit from the scrap supply in the immediate area provided by our existing djj operations as well as strong regional demand for its products this approximately 240 million investment is expected to be operational in the second half of 2020

in may 2018 nucor announced an approximately 275 million investment to construct a new 3 rd generation flexible galvanizing line with an annual capacity of approximately 500000 tons at our nucor steel arkansas facility this project complements the previously mentioned specialty cold mill recently started up at the facility and we believe it will accelerate our goal of increasing our automotive market share the new galvanizing line is expected to be operational in mid2021 in september 2018 nucor announced an approximately 650 million investment to modernize and expand the production capability at its gallatin flatrolled sheet mill located in ghent kentucky this investment will increase the production capability from approximately 1600000 tons to approximately 3000000 tons annually and will increase the maximum coil width to approximately 73 inches this expansion is expected to be completed in mid2021 and complements the previously mentioned hot band galvanizing and pickling line that recently 

 

s tarted up at gallatin  i n january 2019 nucor announced plans to build a stateoftheart plate mill  which will be based in brandenburg kentucky on the ohio river  w ith an expected investment of 1 70 billion  w e expect the mill to be completed in late 2022 and to be capable of producing approximately 1200000 tons per year of steel plate products 

nucor’s steel products segment has also grown significantly in recent years through the acquisitions of the companies that make up our ntp group ntp consists of the former independence tube corporation acquired in october 2016 southland tube inc acquired in january 2017 republic conduit acquired in january 2017 and the assets of century tube llc acquired in december 2018 the combined purchase price of these acquisitions was approximately 898 million ntp is optimizing the teams and assets of the eight strategically located facilities to create leadership positions in the following markets hss steel tubing piling sprinkler pipe steel electrical conduit and mechanical tube for the automotive market the ntp group provides nucor with a line of valueadded products to offer our customers and a significant channel to market as the businesses are consumers of nucor’s hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel

in addition to growing through capital expansions at our existing operations and acquisitions nucor also uses joint ventures as a platform for growth nucorjfe our joint venture with jfe steel corporation of japan in which nucor has 50 ownership is expected to start up in the first quarter of 2020 located in central mexico nucorjfe will supply galvanized sheet steel to the growing mexican automotive market the facilitys construction has faced some unanticipated challenges including more difficult soil conditions requiring incremental piling and insufficient electrical system infrastructure these events increased the total capital budget from our initial estimate of 270 million to approximately 360 million with nucors share of these amounts being 50 nucor’s sheet mills are expected to provide approximately half of the hotrolled steel substrate that will be consumed by the joint venture

capital allocation strategy 

the significant developments in nucor’s business in recent years have been driven by our capital allocation strategy our highest capital allocation priority is to invest in our business for profitable longterm growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing existing operations greenfield expansions and acquisitions

our second priority is to return capital to our stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases nucor has paid 146 billion in dividends to its stockholders during the past three years that dividend payout represents 23 of cash flows from operations during that threeyear period the company repurchased 2985 million of its common stock in 2019 8540 million in 2018 and 903 million in 2017 

we intend to return at least 40 of our net income to stockholders over time via a combination of both cash dividends and share repurchases over the past three years we have returned approximately 55 of our net income in this manner

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service

in our steel mills segment our eaf steel mills face many different forms of competition including domestic integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other domestic eaf steel mills steel imports and alternative materials large domestic integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating 

 

costs eaf based steel producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with large integrated steel producers 

excess global steelmaking capacity particularly in nonmarket economies continues to be a significant challenge for nucor and the entire us steel industry steel production in china rose from approximately 102 billion tons in 2018 to approximately 110 billion tons in 2019 – an increase of 8 as a result china’s share of global crude steel production rose from 513 in 2018 to 533 in 2019 the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” estimates that excess global steel production capacity was approximately 485 million tons through the first half of 2019 up from 455 million tons at the end of 2018 nearly a quarter of that excess capacity is located in china where the largest steel companies are stateowned and receive significant financial support from the chinese government

the section 232 steel tariffs implemented by the current administration in 2018 are having their intended impact by preventing the dumping of steel products in the us market in addition successful industry trade cases over the past several years have had an impact on import levels for the full year 2019 imports of finished steel were down approximately 18 from the previous year and accounted for approximately 19 of us market share the last time steel import levels were this low was in 2010 approximately six million fewer tons of imports entered the united states in 2019 than in 2018 the comprehensive nature of the section 232 tariffs is also preventing the transshipment of artificially lowpriced steel through third party countries

the new united statesmexicocanada trade agreement was passed by the us house and senate and signed by president trump in january 2020 the agreement has several provisions that will benefit the steel industry including requiring that higher levels of a vehicle’s content including steel be produced in north america for a vehicle to qualify for zero tariffs and that 70 of the steel used in vehicles be melted and poured in north america there are also provisions addressing currency manipulation and stateowned enterprises 

the united states also reached a phaseone trade agreement with china in january 2020 which includes enforceable commitments from china to refrain from currency devaluation for competitive purposes negotiations with china continue in order to address china’s use of subsidies and stateowned enterprises which contribute to its persistent steel production overcapacity 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives can become more attractive to our customers

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 168 billion and 208 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from other nucor businesses nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 224 billion and 226 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the majority of these orders are expected to be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally

sources and availability of raw materials 

an ample supply of highquality scrap and scrap substitutes is critical to support nucor’s ability to produce highquality steel nucor’s raw materials segment safely produces sources trades and 

 

transpor t s steelmaking raw materials nucor’s raw materials investments are focused on creating an advantage for its steelmaking operations through a global information network and a multipronged and flexible approach to metallics supply 

scrap and scrap substitutes are the most significant element in the total cost of steel production the average cost of scrap and scrap substitutes used in our steel mills segment decreased 13 from 361 per gross ton used in 2018 to 314 per gross ton used in 2019 on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce one ton of steel depending on the market conditions at the time a raw material surcharge or variable steel pricing mechanism may be implemented to assist nucor in maintaining operating margins and in meeting our customer commitments during periods of rapidly changing scrap and scrap substitute costs 

for the past decade nucor has focused on securing access to lowcost raw material inputs as they are the company’s largest expense nucor’s broad balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallic inputs our investment in dri production facilities and scrap yards as well as our access to international raw materials markets provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw material costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production as well as in the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj gives us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus helps us mitigate the risk of significant fluctuations in the availability and costs of critical inputs

djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate dri plants in trinidad and louisiana with respective annual production capacities of approximately 2000000 and 2500000 metric tons the primary raw material for our dri facilities is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers another major source of raw materials used in the production of steel is pig iron we received over 25 million gross tons of pig iron in 2019 as with scrap and iron ore we source pig iron from a large number of international suppliers

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas which are significant costs to nucor access to longterm low cost sources of energy in various forms is critically important to our continued success because of the efficiency of nucor steel mills we believe we are able to reduce our energy costs relative to other steel producers 

our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges as well as our natural gas drilling operations in addition to the currently producing wells in the piceance basin nucor owns leasehold interests in natural gas properties totaling approximately 54000 acres in the south piceance basin in the western slope of colorado to support nucor’s operating wells and potential future well developments on these properties nucor has entered into longterm agreements directly with existing thirdparty gathering and processing service providers natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our dri plant in louisiana and by our steel mills in the united states the determination of whether or not to participate in all future drilling capital investments by one working interest owner is independent of the other working interest owner as such nucor has full discretion on its participation in all future drilling capital investments

 

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefited from relatively stable and competitive energy costs the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today by many factors including fuel switching coal to natural gas by public utilities changes in supply and demand and pipeline and export infrastructure expansion because energy is such a significant cost for nucor we strive to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace 

environmental laws and regulations 

nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use and has implemented sitewide recycling programs many of our facilities have incorporated energy efficiency targets to reduce both cost and environmental impacts into their environmental management systems these environmental management systems help facilitate compliance with our environmental commitment which is every nucor teammate’s responsibility nucor’s environmental program maintains a high level of ongoing training commitment outreach and visibility

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment the principal federal environmental laws include the clean air act that regulates air emissions the clean water act the “cwa” that regulates water discharges and withdrawals the resource conservation and recovery act the “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “cercla” that governs releases of hazardous substances and remediation of sites contaminated thereby our operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws

as the leading recycler in north america and often one of the largest employers in the communities where we operate we take considerable interest and pride in our environmental track record we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations

the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available

the rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes the rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling and storage of most wastes while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered these activities and offsite properties that the us environmental protection agency the “epa” has determined are contaminated for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level are quickly evaluated and corrected while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under the rcra we believe these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved

because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under the cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor regularly evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under the rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the 

 

operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor believes that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them 

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment this filtrant “eaf dust” is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both the cercla and the rcra

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2020 and 2021 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to innovate our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff we have slightly more than 100 employees in our principal executive offices the vast majority of nucor’s approximately 26800 employees as of december 31 2019 are not represented by labor unions

nucor places the highest value on our teammates’ wellbeing and safety our foremost responsibility is to work safely which requires our teammates to identify unsafe conditions and activities and mitigate these hazards in 2019 we achieved our best safety performance in the key metrics we measure including injuryillness rate and days away restricted and transfer dart case rate we will continue to eliminate exposures that can lead to injury and encourage our teammates to share their ideas for safety improvement

the operations in our mills are highly automated resulting in lower employment costs employee turnover in nucor mills is extremely low nucor employees have a significant part of their compensation based on their productivity production employees work under group incentives that provide increased earnings for increased production this additional incentive compensation is paid weekly additionally because we use eafs to produce our steel we can easily vary our production levels to match shortterm changes in demand unlike our integrated competitors taking advantage of this highly variable lowcost structure has enabled nucor to better control our costs during weaker market conditions

risk factors

tableend

many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the current global steelmaking capacity significantly exceeds the current global consumption of steel according to the oecd global steel production overcapacity was approximately 485 million tons at the halfway point of 2019 with a quarter of that amount located in china overcapacity is down from its peak in 2015 and 2016 efforts by china to close inefficient steel production and improve air quality steel mill closures in europe and stronger global economic growth all contributed to reduce excess capacity

during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

section 232 steel tariffs are keeping dumped steel products out of the us market the us government is also negotiating new or renegotiating existing trade agreements with many countries including china which provide another opportunity to address excess steelmaking capacity should these efforts fail to reduce excess capacity and the section 232 tariffs be lifted us steelmakers would be at risk of having to compete again against steel products dumped in the us market

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy metals service centers appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the us economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows general economic conditions in the united states and steel demand in this country are currently stronger than in many parts of the world but challenges from global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties both in the united states and in other regions of the world remain

while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions future economic downturns or prolonged slowgrowth or a stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

competition from other steel producers imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price quality and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel steel products and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including the cost and availability of raw materials energy technology labor and capital costs currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products

since 2011 automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy “cafe” mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce 

 

as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may seek to reduce the amount of steel they incorporate in their vehicles or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing their demand for steel certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our steel products the raw material required to produce dri is pelletized iron ore although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj in 2008 we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors as well as currency fluctuations at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political regulatory and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions including physical or information systems related issues that impact the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

our steelmaking processes our dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases “ghgs” the regulation of these ghgs through significant new rulemaking or legislation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent domestic ghg 

 

regulations are further implemented because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations we are already impacted in the permit modification and reporting processes both ghg regulations and national air ambient quality standards which are more restrictive than previous standards can make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits 

these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased and continue to increase the cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is mitigating some of this indirect impact as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly however because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas the resulting reduction in capacity can lead to increased electrical energy prices

in 2019 the epa issued its affordable clean energy ace rule to replace the promulgated clean power plan that was driving many utilities to shutter coal fired power plants while this is expected to result in lower electric power costs in the united states another change in regulatory approach due to political or other considerations could cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy adversely impacting nucor’s competitive position

while the federal government has moved in recent years to relax some regulations that can impact domestic energy costs some states are moving to enact their own regulations to curtail carbon and other ghg emissions if such regulations are enacted in states in which nucor does business it could increase our costs there numerous states including california washington oregon and new york are considering or have passed laws using environmental product declarations “epds” to evaluate environmental impacts of products california has implemented the “buy clean california act” and california is currently requesting epds from manufacturers to be used in state of california funded projects epds are now required for certain materials including some steel products global warming potentials “gwp” will be established by january 1 2021 for applicable product categories and epds will be used to determine product compliance to the gwp limits the impacts identified by epds could impact future stateconsumer purchasing decisions in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to these regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment

we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations threats from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information personal data reputational damage or could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel resulting in lost revenues as well as delays in reporting our financial results we also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems we may also contend with potential liability for stolen information increased cybersecurity protection costs litigation expense and increased insurance premiums

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes critical equipment failures acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset a portion of the losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent that any such losses are not covered by our insurance or that there are significant delays in resolving our claims with our insurance providers

 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and accordingly we make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates

nucor has implemented revised epa rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials we have incurred increased administrative and operational costs to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag mill scale iron dusts lime and air filtration control dusts to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted

if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows

we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2019 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 40 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds shortterm commercial paper issuance or from borrowings under our 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot guarantee that this will be the case additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources

risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations

certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states in europe mexico and in emerging markets there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets these risks include but are not limited to unfavorable political or economic factors local labor and social issues changes in regulatory requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and complex foreign laws treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 fcpa these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes

 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry as well as changes in interest rates commodity prices and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations

tax increases and changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the united states nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks

we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations contractual obligations and other legal standards notwithstanding this we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in respect of various issues including regulatory safety environmental employment transportation intellectual property contractual importexport international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings see “item 3 legal proceedings” a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the nature of our operations means that legal compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

tableend

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of nucor corporation should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report discusses our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 information concerning the year ended december 31 2017 and a comparison of years 2018 and 2017 may be found under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 filed with the sec on february 28 2019

overview 

the growth rate of the us economy slowed a bit in 2019 growing at 23 on an annualized basis compared to 29 the previous year demand in 2019 remained healthy in many of the markets nucor monitors with the strongest being nonresidential construction operating rates at our steel mills for the full year 2019 decreased to 84 as compared to 91 for the full year 2018  industrywide the us capacity utilization rate was 80 for 2019 its highest annual rate since 2008 

the section 232 steel tariffs continued to be effective in keeping unfairly traded imports out of the us market for the full year 2019 finished steel imports were down approximately 18 from the previous year and accounted for approximately 19 of us market share this was the lowest level of steel imports since 2010 approximately six million fewer tons of imports entered the united states in 2019 

we are optimistic about market conditions heading into 2020 there have been a number of recent positive developments at the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 including the united statesmexicocanada trade agreement becoming law and reduced trade tensions with china we expect stable or growing enduse markets in the markets that account for approximately 70 of our shipments we expect the nonresidential construction market to remain strong 

 

our challenges and risks 

sales of many of our products are largely dependent upon capital spending in the nonresidential construction markets in the united states including in the industrial and commercial sectors as well as capital spending on infrastructure that is publicly funded such as bridges schools prisons and hospitals while there has been no federal infrastructure bill many states have passed bills funding infrastructure improvements 

while the section 232 tariffs are having their intended impact by keeping unfairly traded imports out of the us market global steel production overcapacity continues to be a longterm challenge steel production in china rose in 2019 going from approximately 102 billion tons in 2018 to approximately 110 billion tons in 2019 – an increase of 8 as a result china’s share of global crude steel production rose from 513 in 2018 to 533 in 2019 the oecd estimates that global excess steel production capacity was approximately 485 million tons at the halfway point of 2019 up from 455 million tons at the end of 2018 nearly a quarter of that excess capacity is located in china where the largest steel companies are stateowned and receive significant financial support from the chinese government 

a major uncertainty we continue to face in our business is the price of our principal raw material ferrous scrap which is volatile and often increases or decreases rapidly in response to changes in domestic demand unanticipated events that affect the flow of scrap into scrap yards the availability of scrap substitutes currency fluctuations and changes in foreign demand for scrap in periods of rapidly increasing raw material prices in the industry which are often also associated with periods of strong or rapidly improving steel market conditions being able to increase our prices for the products we sell quickly enough to offset increases in the prices we pay for ferrous scrap is challenging but critical to maintaining our profitability we attempt to mitigate the scrap price risk by managing scrap inventory 

 

levels at the steel mills to match the anticipated demand over the next several weeks certain scrap substitutes including pig iron have longer lead times for delivery than scrap which can make this inventory management strategy difficult to achieve continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production  coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj give us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus also helps us to mitigate this risk 

during periods of stronger or improving steel market conditions we are more likely to be able to pass through to our customers relatively quickly the increased costs of ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes protecting our gross margins from significant erosion during weaker or rapidly deteriorating steel market conditions weak steel demand low industry utilization rates and the impact of imports create an even more intensified competitive environment and increased pricing pressure all of those factors to some degree impact pricing which increases the likelihood that nucor will experience lower gross margins

although the majority of our steel sales are to spot market customers in north america who place their orders each month based on their business needs and our pricing competitiveness compared to both domestic and global producers and trading companies we also sell contract tons most notably in our sheet operations approximately 75 of our sheet sales were to contract customers in 2019 and 2018 with the balance in the spot market at the prevailing prices at the time of sale steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant the amount of tons sold to contract customers depends on the overall market conditions at the time how the enduse customers see the market moving forward and the strategy that nucor management believes is appropriate to the upcoming period

nucor management considerations include maintaining an appropriate balance of spot and contract tons based on market projections and appropriately supporting our diversified customer base the percentage of tons that is placed under contract also depends on the overall market dynamics and customer negotiations in years of strengthening demand we typically see an increase in the percentage of sheet sales sold under contract as our customers have an expectation that transaction prices will rapidly rise and available capacity will quickly be sold out to mitigate this risk customers prefer to enter into contracts in order to obtain committed volumes of supply from the mills our contracts include a method of adjusting prices on a periodic basis to reflect changes in the market pricing for steel andor scrap market indices for steel generally trend with scrap pricing changes but during periods of steel market weakness the more intensified competitive steel market environment can cause the sales price indices to decrease resulting in reduced gross margins and profitability furthermore since the selling price adjustments are not immediate there will always be a timing difference between changes in the prices we pay for raw materials and the adjustments we make to our contract selling prices generally in periods of increasing scrap prices we experience a shortterm margin contraction on contract tons conversely in periods of decreasing scrap prices we typically experience a shortterm margin expansion contract sales typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months

our strengths and opportunities

we are north america’s most diversified steel producer as a result our shortterm performance is not tied to any one market we have numerous large strategic capital projects at various stages of progress that will help us further diversify our product offerings and expand the markets that we serve we expect these investments to grow our longterm earnings power by increasing our channels to market expanding our product portfolio into higher valueadded offerings that are less vulnerable to imports improving our cost structure and further building upon our market leadership positions

nucor’s raw material supply chain is another important strength our investment in dri production facilities and scrap brokerage and processing businesses provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw materials costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control reduces risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a considerable portion of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that historically have experienced greater political turmoil

 

our highly variable lowcost structure combined with our financial strength and liquidity has allowed us to successfully navigate cyclical severely depressed steel industry market conditions in the past in such times our incentivebased pay system reduces our payroll costs both hourly and salary which helps to offset lower selling prices our payforperformance system that is closely tied to our levels of production also allows us to keep our highly experienced workforce intact and to continue operating our facilities when some of our competitors with greater fixed costs are forced to shut down some of their facilities because we use eafs to produce our steel we can easily vary our production levels to match shortterm changes in demand unlike our blast furnacebased integrated competitors we believe these strengths also provide us further opportunities to gain market share during such times 

evaluating our operating performance

we report our results of operations in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials most of the steel we produce in our mills is sold to outside customers 80 in both 2019 and 2018 but a significant percentage is used internally by many of the facilities in our steel products segment 20 in both 2019 and 2018

we begin measuring our performance by comparing our net sales both in total and by individual segment during a reporting period with our net sales in the corresponding period in the prior year in doing so we focus on changes in and the reasons for such changes in the two key variables that have the greatest influence on our net sales average sales price per ton during the period and total tons shipped to outside customers

we also focus on both dollar and percentage changes in gross margins which are key drivers of our profitability and the reasons for such changes there are many factors from period to period that can affect our gross margins one consistent area of focus for us is changes in “metal margins” which is the difference between the selling price of steel and the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes increases or decreases in the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes that are not offset by changes in the selling price of steel can quickly compress or expand our margins and reduce or increase our profitability

changes in marketing administrative and other expenses particularly profit sharing and other variable incentivebased payment costs can have a material effect on our results of operations for a reporting period as well these costs vary significantly from period to period as they are based upon changes in our pretax earnings and other profitability metrics that are a reflection of our payforperformance system that is closely tied to our levels of production

evaluating our financial condition

we evaluate our financial condition each reporting period by focusing primarily on the amounts of and reasons for changes in cash provided by operating activities our current ratio the turnover rate of our accounts receivable and inventories the amounts of and reasons for changes in cash used in or provided by investing activities and financing activities and our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments position at period end our conservative financial practices have served us well in the past and are serving us well today as a result our financial position remains strong

comparison of 2019 to 2018 

results of operations 

nucor reported consolidated net earnings of 414 per diluted share in 2019 though this year’s results decreased from record consolidated net earnings of 742 per diluted share reported in 2018 we view this as solid performance given the more challenging environment when compared to the prior year 

nucor’s recordsetting profitability in 2018 was fueled by a strong domestic economy driving domestic steel demand the adoption of tax reform and the ongoing efforts to reform federal regulations also benefitting 2018 were reductions in unfairly traded imports entering our country as a result of years of successful trade cases and broadbased tariffs imposed under section 232 which were announced in 

 

march 2018 these conditions and our execution of strong operating performance continued for the remainder of 2018 making it the most profitable year in nucor’s history we believe that as a result of those strong steel industry conditions customers purchased in excess of normal demand levels in 2018 resulting in excess inventory throughout the supply chain by the end of 2018 inventory destocking was the primary driver for the decreased 2019 performance as average steel selling prices fell throughout most of 2019  despite lower imports and relatively stable underlying demand  we believe that inventory destocking concluded in the fourth quarter of 2019 when customers resumed more normal buying patterns additionally we announced price increases for our sheet bar plate and structural products in the fourth quarter of 2019 that we expect to realize the benefit of in the first quarter of 2020 though down from 2018 we believe market demand remained healthy in 2019 as we saw stable or improv ing market conditions in 16 of the 24 enduse markets we monitor  

nucor’s steel products segment experienced record profitability in 2019 surpassing the previous record set in 2018 in particular our vulcraftverco group combined joist and deck operations and metal building businesses had the most profitable year in their history in 2019 the improved segment performance in 2019 was due to the strong performance of many of the businesses that make up this segment which benefited from strong nonresidential construction market conditions and lower steel input costs additionally changes in business strategy and efficiency initiatives significantly improved the performance of our rebar fabrication operations and metal buildings business 

the raw materials segment faced a challenging year in 2019 primarily due to decreased pricing for raw materials when compared to 2018 we saw significant declines in the profitability of our dri businesses due to margin compression caused by decreased average selling prices and increased iron ore costs our dri facility in louisiana also experienced a planned 70day outage in 2019 that began in early september and was completed in midnovember the profitability of djj’s brokerage and scrap processing operations also decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018

the following discussion will provide greater quantitative and qualitative analysis of nucor’s performance in 2019 as compared to 2018

net sales – net sales to external customers by segment for 2019 and 2018 were as follows in thousands 

 



 

net sales for 2019 decreased 10 from the prior year average sales price per ton decreased 5 from 899 in 2018 to 851 in 2019 total tons shipped to outside customers decreased 5 from 27899000 tons in 2018 to 26532000 in 2019

in the steel mills segment sales tons were as follows in thousands

 



 

net sales for the steel mills segment decreased 14 in 2019 from the prior year due to an 8 decrease in the average sales price per ton from 817 in 2018 to 748 in 2019 as well as a 7 decrease in total tons shipped to outside customers in 2019 average selling prices and volumes decreased across all product groups within the steel mills segment

 

outside sales tonnage for the steel products segment was as follows in thousands 

 



 

net sales for the steel products segment increased 3 in 2019 from the prior year due to a 4 increase in the average sales price per ton from 1402 in 2018 to 1452 in 2019 which was partially offset by a 1 decrease in volume in 2019 average selling prices increased across all businesses within the steel products segment except for our tubular products businesses the largest decrease in volume for 2019 as compared to 2018 was in our cold finished products business 

net sales for the raw materials segment decreased 18 in 2019 from the prior year primarily due to decreased average selling prices at djj’s brokerage operations and to a lesser extent decreased average selling prices and volumes at djj’s scrap processing operations approximately 90 of outside sales in the raw materials segment in both 2019 and 2018 were from djj’s brokerage operations and approximately 9 of outside sales were from djj’s scrap processing operations

gross margins – in 2019 nucor recorded gross margins of 268 billion 12 which was a decrease from 430 billion 17 in 2018 



 

scrap prices are driven by the global supply and demand for scrap and other ironbased raw materials used to make steel scrap prices decreased during most of 2019 as we enter 2020 we see a more stable price environment as scrap prices have increased a trend that began in late 2019 

 

preoperating and startup costs of new facilities increased to approximately 103 million in 2019 as compared to 36 million in 2018 the increase in preoperating and startup costs was due to increased costs at the bar mills being built in missouri and florida increased costs for the cold mill expansion at our sheet mill in arkansas and increased costs related to the expansion at our sheet mill in kentucky nucor defines preoperating and startup costs all of which are expensed as the losses attributable to facilities or major projects that are either under construction or in the early stages of operation once these facilities or projects have attained a utilization rate that is consistent with our similar operating facilities they are no longer considered by nucor to be in startup

 



 



in 2019 our louisiana dri facility experienced a planned 70day outage that began in early september and was completed in midnovember that replaced the convection section of the facility’s process gas heater and relined the reactor’s refractory 

gross margins related to djj’s scrap processing operations decreased significantly in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to margin compression and decreased volumes gross margins for djj’s brokerage operations also decreased in 2019

included in 2018 gross margins of the raw materials segment was a 276 million benefit related to insurance recoveries

marketing administrative and other expenses – a major component of marketing administrative and other expenses is profit sharing and other incentive compensation costs these costs which are based upon and fluctuate with nucor’s financial performance decreased from 2018 to 2019 due to our decreased profitability in 2019 in 2019 profit sharing costs consisted of 1814 million of contributions including the company’s matching contribution made to the company’s profit sharing and retirement savings plan for qualified employees 3079 million in 2018 other bonus costs also fluctuate based on nucor’s achievement of certain financial performance goals including achieving record earnings and comparisons of nucor’s financial performance to peers in the steel industry and other companies stockbased compensation included in marketing administrative and other expenses increased by 21 to 369 million in 2019 compared with 306 million in 2018 and includes costs associated with the vesting of stock awards granted in prior years also included in marketing administrative and other expenses in 2018 is approximately 50 million in bonus costs related to the company achieving record earnings that was distributed evenly among employees none in 2019 

included in marketing administrative and other expenses in 2019 was a benefit of 337 million related to the gain on the sale of an equity method investment in the raw materials segment included in marketing administrative and other expenses in 2018 was a 205 million benefit related to insurance recoveries

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates – equity method investment earnings were 33 million in 2019 and 402 million in 2018 the decrease in equity method investment earnings from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to margin compression and decreased volumes at numit 

impairment of assets – during the third quarter of 2018 nucor performed an impairment analysis of its three fields of proved producing natural gas well assets and determined that the carrying amount exceeded the fair value and was other than temporary for two of these fields of wells as a result nucor recorded a 1100 million noncash impairment charge against these assets driven primarily by management’s estimate of future pricing of natural gas and natural gas liquids 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 nucor performed another impairment analysis of its three fields of proved producing natural gas well assets and determined that the carrying amount of one of the fields of wells exceeded its fair value and was other than temporary this field of wells was not impaired as a result of the 2018 analysis nucor recorded a 350 million noncash impairment charge against this field of wells driven primarily by estimated lease operating costs that were higher than the estimates used in the 2018 analysis these charges were included in the raw materials segment see note 8 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nucor recorded additional impairment charges in 2019 of 200 million related to certain property plant and equipment in the steel mills segment and 119 million related to the writedown of certain intangible assets in the steel products segment

 

interest expense income – net interest expense is detailed below in thousands 

 



 

interest expense decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase in capitalized interest related to an increase in spending associated with capital projects in 2019 included in interest expense in 2018 was the benefit received from the settlement of a treasury lock instrument that was entered into in anticipation of the company’s debt issuance that occurred in the second quarter of 2018 the company did not elect hedge accounting for this instrument interest income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase in average interest rates on investments

 

earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests – earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests by segment for 2019 and 2018 were as follows in thousands 

 



 

earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in the steel mills segment decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to the previously mentioned lower average selling prices volumes and metal margin additionally increased preoperating and startup costs of new facilities and reduced earnings of our numit equity method investment contributed to lower 2019 earnings as compared to 2018 excess inventory throughout the supply chain resulted in aggressive destocking during 2019 additionally unusually wet weather conditions early in 2019 negatively impacted markets and projects located in areas affected by these weather conditions overall operating rates for the steel mills segment decreased from 91 in 2018 to 84 in 2019

the steel products segment reported record earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in 2019 beating the previous record set in 2018 due to the reasons previously discussed partially offsetting these increases were decreased earnings at our tubular products businesses which suffered from aggressive destocking by service center customers resulting in lower order rates that drove down prices and margins

the profitability of our raw materials segment in 2019 decreased significantly compared to 2018 due to the reasons previously discussed resulting in a full year loss in 2019 in 2019 nucor incurred a 350 million noncash impairment charge relating to our proved producing natural gas well assets that was partially offset by a benefit of 337 million related to the gain on the sale of an equity method investment in the raw materials segment included in 2018’s profitability was a 1100 million noncash impairment charge related to our proved producing natural gas well assets which was partially offset by a benefit of 481 million related to insurance recoveries 

the decrease in losses in corporateeliminations in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to decreased intercompany eliminations of profit in inventory as well as lower profit sharing costs

noncontrolling interests – noncontrolling interests represent the income attributable to the noncontrolling partners of nucor’s joint ventures primarily nucor–yamato of which nucor owns 51 the 

 

decrease in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2019 as comparted to 2018 was primarily due to the decreased earnings of nucor–yamato  which was a result of decreased sales volumes under the n ucor–yamato limited partnership agreement the minimum amount of cash to be distributed each year to the partners is the amount needed by each partner to pay applicable us federal and state income taxes 

provision for income taxes – the company’s effective tax rate in 2019 was 231 compared with 232 in 2018 nucor has concluded us federal income tax matters for years through 2014 the tax years 2015 through 2018 remain open to examination by the internal revenue service the canada revenue agency has concluded its examination of the 2012 and 2013 canadian returns for harris steel group inc and certain related affiliates the 2015 tax year is currently under examination by the canada revenue agency the trinidad and tobago inland revenue division has concluded its examination of the nuiron unlimited 2013 corporate income tax return the tax years 2013 through 2018 remain open to examination by other major taxing jurisdictions to which nucor is subject primarily canada and other state and local jurisdictions 

net earnings and return on equity – nucor reported net earnings of 127 billion or 414 per diluted share in 2019 compared to net earnings of 236 billion or 742 per diluted share in 2018 net earnings attributable to nucor stockholders as a percentage of net sales were 56 and 94 in 2019 and 2018 respectively return on average stockholders’ equity was 126 and 255 in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

nucor’s cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments position remained strong at 183 billion at december 31 2019 compared with 140 billion as of december 31 2018 approximately 3544 million and 2465 million of the cash and cash equivalents position at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively was held by our majorityowned joint ventures cash flows provided by operating activities provide us with a significant source of liquidity when needed we have external shortterm financing sources available including the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under our bank credit facilities we also issue longterm debt securities from time to time

nucor’s 15 billion revolving credit facility is undrawn and was amended and restated in april 2018 to extend the maturity date to april 2023 we believe our financial strength is a key strategic advantage among domestic steel producers particularly during recessionary business cycles we carry the highest credit ratings of any steel producer headquartered in north america with an a longterm rating from standard and poor’s and a baa1 longterm rating from moody’s our credit ratings are dependent however upon a number of factors both qualitative and quantitative and are subject to change at any time the disclosure of our credit ratings is made in order to enhance investors’ understanding of our sources of liquidity and the impact of our credit ratings on our cost of funds based upon the preceding factors we expect to continue to have adequate access to the capital markets at a reasonable cost of funds for liquidity purposes when needed  

selected measures of liquidity and capital resources

 



 

the current ratio which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities was 33 at yearend 2019 compared with 31 at yearend 2018 the current ratio was positively impacted by the 4358 million increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments the current ratio was also positively impacted by a 2265 million decrease in accounts payable and a 1986 million decrease in 

 

salaries wages and related accruals accounts payable decreased due to the decrease in value and quantity of scrap inventory  t he de crease in salaries wages and related accruals was due to reduced performancebased bonus accruals in 2019 over 2018 which was a record earnings year the current ratio was negatively impacted by a 7114 million decrease in inventories  which was due to a 9 decrease in tons on hand from yearend 2018 to yearend 2019 as well as a 2 2  decrease in the value of scrap inventory 

in 2019 total accounts receivable turned approximately every five weeks and inventories turned approximately every 11 weeks these ratios compare with accounts receivable turnover of approximately every five weeks and inventory turnover of approximately every 10 weeks in 2018

funds provided by operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and new borrowings under existing credit facilities are expected to be adequate to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements for existing operations for at least the next 24 months

offbalance sheet arrangements

we have a simple capital structure with no offbalance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated special purpose entities that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity

capital allocation strategy

nucor’s conservative financial practices have served us well in the past and are serving us well today nucor’s financial strength allows for a consistent balanced approach to capital allocation throughout the business cycle nucor’s highest capital allocation priority is to reinvest in our business to ensure our continued profitable growth over the long term we have historically done this by investing to optimize our existing operations initiate greenfield expansions and make acquisitions our second priority is to return capital to our stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases we intend to return a minimum of 40 of our net earnings to our stockholders while maintaining a debttocapital ratio that supports a strong investment grade credit rating the company repurchased 2985 million of shares of its common stock in 2019 8540 million in 2018 and 903 million in 2017 

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities was 281 billion in 2019 as compared to 239 billion in 2018 the primary reason for the increase in cash provided by operating activities was the 140 billion reduction of cash used by operating assets and operating liabilities changes in operating assets and operating liabilities exclusive of acquisitions and dispositions provided cash of 4133 million in 2019 as compared to using 9832 million of cash in 2018 the funding of working capital decreased in 2019 over the prior year mainly due to decreases in inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in federal income tax receivable and decreases in accounts payable and salaries wages and related accruals from yearend 2018 to yearend 2019 inventories and accounts payable decreased due to a 22 decline in average scrap and scrap substitutes cost per ton in inventory and a 9 decline in total inventory tons on hand the increase in federal income tax receivable is mainly a function of the timing of federal tax payments the increase in cash used to fund salaries wages and related accruals was primarily attributable to the increased payout of accrued profit sharing and other incentive compensation costs in 2019 as compared to payouts in 2018 the 2019 payments were based on nucor’s financial performance in 2018 which was a record earnings year

our business is capital intensive therefore cash used in investing activities primarily represents capital expenditures for new facilities the expansion and upgrading of existing facilities and the acquisition of other companies cash used in investing activities in 2019 was 179 billion as compared to 103 billion in 2018 the primary driver for the increase in cash used in investing activities was that cash used for capital expenditures increased by 50 from 9825 million in 2018 to 148 billion in 2019 the increase in capital expenditures in 2019 over the prior year was primarily related to the following the new 

 

hot band galvanizing line and sheet mill expansion at nucor steel gallatin the new micro mill greenfield expansion in sedalia missouri the new merchant bar quality mill at nucor steel kankakee  inc  the galvanizing line and specialty cold mill complex at nucor steel arkansas and project 8000 at nucor steel louisiana other drivers of the increase in cash used in investing activities were our purchase of 3677 million in investments and a 500 million increase in cash used to fund acquisitions over the prior year cash provided by the divestiture of an affiliate of 676 million related to the sale of an equity method investment and an overall decrease in investments made in affiliates in 2019 compared to 2018 partially offset the capital expenditures investment purchases and acquisitions 

financing activities

cash used in financing activities in 2019 was 8804 million as compared to 9082 million in 2018 in 2018 cash from financing activities benefited from the issuance of 5000 million of 3950 notes due 2028 and 5000 million of 4400 notes due 2048 which was offset by the repayment in the same quarter of 5000 million of 5850 notes due 2018 additionally the company repurchased 2985 million of shares of its common stock in 2019 compared to 8540 million in 2018 

our credit facility includes only one financial covenant which is a limit of 60 on the ratio of funded debt to total capitalization in addition the credit facility contains customary nonfinancial covenants including a limit on nucor’s ability to pledge the company’s assets and a limit on consolidations mergers and sales of assets our funded debt to total capital ratio was 29 at the end of 2019 and 30 at the end of 2018 and we were in compliance with all other covenants under our credit facility at the end of 2019

market risk

nucor’s largest exposure to market risk is in our steel mills and steel products segments our utilization rates for the steel mills and steel products facilities for the fourth quarter of 2019 were 83 and 69 respectively a significant portion of our steel mills and steel products segments’ sales are into the commercial industrial and municipal construction markets our largest single customer in 2019 represented approximately 5 of sales and consistently pays within terms in the raw materials segment we are exposed to price fluctuations related to the purchase of scrap steel pig iron and iron ore our exposure to market risk is mitigated by the fact that our steel mills use a significant portion of the products of this segment

nucor’s taxexempt industrial development revenue bonds “idrbs” have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly these idrbs represented 24 of nucor’s longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2019 the remaining 76 of nucor’s longterm debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings from time to time nucor makes use of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk as of december 31 2019 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to partially manage its exposure to price risk related to purchases of natural gas used in the production process as well as scrap copper and aluminum purchased for resale to its customers in addition nucor uses forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time to hedge cash flows associated with certain assets and liabilities firm commitments and anticipated transactions nucor generally does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than hedging the cash flows associated with specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in future periods and hedging the exposures related to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixedrate debt instruments and foreign currency transactions nucor recognizes all derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value

the company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and mexico we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations

dividends

nucor has increased its base cash dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 1973 nucor paid dividends of 160 per share in 2019 compared with 152 per share in 2018 in december 2019 the board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend on nucor’s common stock to 

 

040 25 per share over the p ast 10 years nucor has returned approximately  6 0 billion in capital to its stock holders in the form of base dividends and sha re repurchases in february 2020 the board of directors declared nucor’s 188th consecutive quarterly cash dividend of 0 4025 per share payable on may 11  2020 to stockholders of record on march 31  2020 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december 31 2019 for the periods presented in thousands

 



 









note in addition to the amounts shown in the table above 509 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled related to these unrecognized tax benefits we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of 119 million at december 31 2019

outlook 

in 2020 we expect to continue to take advantage of our position of strength to grow nucor’s longterm earnings power and stockholder value by continuing to successfully implement our five drivers to profitable growth strategy utilizing this strategy we have invested significant capital over a broad range of strategic acquisitions and investments that we believe will further enhance our ability to grow nucor’s longterm earnings power by increasing our channels to market expand our product portfolios into higher valueadded offerings that are less vulnerable to imports improve our highly variable lowcost structure build upon our market leadership positions and achieve commercial excellence we are utilizing nucor’s financial strength to execute on investment opportunities to further grow our longterm earnings capacity

 

we expect nucor’s earnings in the first quarter of 2020 to increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 we expect earnings in the steel mills segment to increase in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment charge due to price increases that were announced in the fourth quarter of 2019 and expected higher volumes we expect a more stable pricing environment in 2020 after the severe inventory destocking that occurred in 

 

2019 we expect the profitability of the steel products segment in the first quarter of 2020 to decrease as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment charges  due to normal seasonality we expect the performance of the raw materials segment to increase in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 due to an improvement in pricing for raw materials the absence of the impairment charge related to our proved producing natural gas well assets and no planned nonroutine outages at our louisiana dri plant   

as we begin 2020 we see stable or improving market conditions in 17 of the 24 enduse markets that we monitor we believe that full year domestic steel demand will experience modest growth in 2020 as compared to 2019 backlog volumes in both the steel mills and steel products segments were higher at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018

we are ever mindful of the threat of increases in imported steel stemming from the still significant excess foreign steel capacity the section 232 tariffs are having their intended impact by taking artificially lowcost foreign imports out of the us market over the past decade the steel industry has won several important trade cases that addressed unfairly traded imports prior to the imposition of the section 232 tariffs the cumulative impact of those trade case victories also took a sizeable amount of unfairly traded imports out of the market and those duties will remain in the event the section 232 tariffs are lifted

 

we are committed to executing on the opportunities we see ahead to reward nucor stockholders with very attractive longterm returns on their valuable capital invested in our company our industryleading financial strength allows us to support investments in our facilities that we believe will enable us to generate increased profitability in 2020 as we have in our past we will allocate capital to investments that we believe will build our longterm earnings power capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately 20 billion in 2020 and we will be very focused on ensuring that these investments generate appropriate returns

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to the valuation allowances for receivables the carrying value of noncurrent assets and reserves for environmental obligations and income taxes our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources accordingly actual costs could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

allowances for doubtful accounts

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required

inventories

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the company records any amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value as a charge to cost of products sold scrap and scrap substitute costs are a very significant component of the raw material semifinished and finished product inventory balances the vast majority of the company’s inventory is recorded on the firstin firstout method production costs are applied to semifinished and finished product inventory from the approximate period in which they are produced

 

if steel selling prices were to decline in future quarters writedowns of inventory could result specifically the valuation of raw material inventories purchased during periods of peak market pricing would most likely be impacted low utilization rates at our steel mills or raw materials facilities could hinder our ability to work through highpriced scrap and scrap substitutes particularly pig iron and iron ore leading to periodend exposure when comparing carrying value to net realizable value 

longlived asset impairments

we evaluate our property plant and equipment and finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment on an individual asset basis or at the lowest level asset grouping for which cash flows can be independently identified asset impairments are assessed whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets could exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows in developing estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations we utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce when it is determined that an impairment exists the related assets are written down to estimated fair market value

certain longlived asset groupings were tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019 undiscounted cash flows for each asset grouping were estimated using management’s longrange estimates of market conditions associated with each asset grouping over the estimated useful life of the principal asset within the group our undiscounted cash flow analysis indicated that other than the two groupings discussed below the tested longlived asset groupings were recoverable as of december 31 2019 however if our projected cash flows are not realized either because of an extended recessionary period or other unforeseen events impairment charges may be required in future periods a 20 decrease in the projected cash flows of each of our asset groupings would not result in an impairment 

in the third quarter of 2018 due to the deteriorating natural gas pricing environment at our sales point in the piceance basin nucor determined a triggering event had occurred and performed an impairment analysis that resulted in a 1100 million noncash impairment charge relating to two of its three groups fields” of wells one of the main assumptions that most significantly affects the undiscounted cash flows determination is management’s estimate of future pricing of natural gas and natural gas liquids the pricing used in the impairment assessment was developed by management based on projected natural gas market supply and demand dynamics in conjunction with a review of projections by market analysts management also makes key estimates on the expected reserve levels and on the expected lease operating costs the impairment assessment was performed on each of nucor’s three fields of wells with each field defined by common geographic location

 

the natural gas pricing environment continued to decline in 2019 and the resulting decrease in performance of the natural gas well assets reached such a point in the fourth quarter of 2019 that nucor determined a triggering event had occurred nucor performed an impairment analysis on all three fields the field of wells that was not impaired as a result of the 2018 analysis did not pass the 2019 undiscounted cash flow impairment analysis an aftertax discounted cash flow analysis was performed for this field to determine the amount of impairment which was 350 million an increase in the estimated lease operating cost projections was the primary factor in causing this field of wells to be impaired the noncash impairment charges are included in the raw materials segment and in impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the postimpairment carrying value of this field was 123 million at december 31 2019 518 million at december 31 2018 the two previously impaired fields had a combined carrying value of 666 million at december 31 2019 710 million at december 31 2018 changes in the natural gas industry or a prolonged lowprice environment beyond what had already been assumed in the assessments could cause management to revise the natural gas and natural gas liquids price assumptions the estimated reserves or the estimated lease operating costs unfavorable revisions to these assumptions or estimates could possibly result in further impairment of some or all of the fields of proved well assets

in the steel mills segment nucor recorded a noncash impairment charge of 200 million related to certain property plant and equipment at our plate mill in texas this charge is included in impairment of assets in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2019

 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred we perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the recorded value including goodwill

when appropriate nucor performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for certain reporting units it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis in these instances a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of these reporting units significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as part of our annual testing and any required interim testing include i expected cash flow for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs ii an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit iii a discount rate based on management’s best estimate of the aftertax weightedaverage cost of capital and iv a probabilityweighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence management considers historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate

our fourth quarter 2019 annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge management does not believe that future impairment of these reporting units is probable however the performance of certain businesses that comprise our reporting units requires continued improvement an increase of approximately 50 basis points in the discount rate a critical assumption in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value would not result in an impairment charge see note 9 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the results of the company’s 2019 annual goodwill impairment analysis

nucor will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout 2020 in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual qualitative andor quantitative impairment test during our fourth quarter of 2020 changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill

as a result of management’s changes to their business strategy and structure an impairment charge of 33 million was taken on the finitelived intangible assets associated with the grating reporting unit additionally an impairment charge of 86 million was taken on the finitelived intangible assets specifically trade names associated with the tubular products reporting unit due to the restructuring and name change of the entities in that reporting unit as of january 1 2020

equity method investments

investments in joint ventures in which nucor shares control over the financial and operating decisions but in which nucor is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method each of the company’s equity method investments is subject to a review for impairment if and when circumstances indicate that a decline in value below its carrying amount may have occurred examples of such circumstances include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in the earnings performance or business prospects of the investee missed financial projections a significant adverse change in the regulatory tax economic or technological environment of the investee a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates and recurring negative cash flows from operations when management considers the decline to be other than temporary the company would write down the related investment to its estimated fair market value an otherthantemporary decline in carrying value is determined to have occurred when in management’s judgment a decline in fair value below carrying value is of such length of time andor severity that it is considered longterm

 

in the event that an impairment review is necessary we calculate the estimated fair value of our equity method investments using a probabilityweighted multiplescenario income approach management’s analysis includes three discounted cash flow scenarios best case base case and recessionary case which contain forecasted nearterm cash flows under each scenario generally i the best case scenario contains estimates of future results ranging from slightly higher than recent operating performance to levels that are consistent with historical operating and financial performance ii the base case scenario contains estimates of future results ranging from generally in line with recent operating performance to levels that are more conservative than historical operating and financial performance and iii the recessionary case scenario contains estimates of future results which include limited growth resulting only from operational cost improvements and limited benefits of new highervalue product offerings management determines the probability that each cash flow scenario will come to fruition based on the specific facts and circumstances of each of the preceding scenarios with the base case typically receiving the majority of the weighting 

key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our equity method investments include i expected cash flow for the sixyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs ii an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the investment iii a discount rate based on management’s best estimate of the aftertax weightedaverage cost of capital and iv a probabilityweighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence while the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include projected revenues metal margins and discount rate the assumptions are often interdependent and no single factor predominates in determining the estimated fair value management considers historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its investments are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate

due to the protracted challenging steel market conditions in europe nucor concluded that it was appropriate to assess its equity investment in duferdofin nucor for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019 after completing its assessment the company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount by a sufficient amount and that there was no need for an impairment charge the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include projected cashflows and the discount rate it is reasonably possible that material deviation of future performance from the estimates used in our most recent valuation could result in impairment of our investment in duferdofin nucor

environmental remediation

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal state and local authorities and we make provisions for the estimated costs related to compliance undiscounted remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures the accruals are reviewed periodically and as investigations and remediation proceed adjustments are made as we believe are necessary our measurement of environmental liabilities is based on currently available facts present laws and regulations and current technology

income taxes

we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes under the liability method deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations are recognized as a component of interest expense and other expenses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them

interest rate risk – nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2019 approximately 24 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly the remaining 76 of nucor’s longterm debt was at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2019 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk – in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in periods of strong or stable demand for our products we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for our products is weaker this becomes more challenging our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs dri is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic steel production 

natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states 

nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in net earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2019 accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes included 140 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of the derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2019 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands

 



 

any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities

foreign currency risk – nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and mexico we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2019 and 2018 were insignificant

 item 1 business 

tableend overview 

nucor corporation and its affiliates “nucor” the “company” “we” “us” or “our” manufacture steel and steel products the company also produces direct reduced iron “dri” for use in its steel mills through the david j joseph company and its affiliates “djj” the company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and dri most of the company’s operating facilities and customers are located in north america the company’s operations include international trading and sales companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the company and others 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2018 we recycled approximately 199 million gross tons of scrap steel 

capital allocation strategy 

the significant developments in nucor’s business in recent years have aligned with our capital allocation strategy our highest capital allocation priority is to invest in our business for profitable longterm growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing existing operations acquisitions and greenfield expansions 

our second priority is to provide our stockholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in delivering longterm earnings growth nucor has paid 145 billion in dividends to its stockholders during the past three years that dividend payout represents 28 of cash flows from operations during that threeyear period 

our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when our cash position is strong compared to growth investment opportunities in september 2018 nucor’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to 20 billion of its common stock the board of directors also terminated any previously authorized repurchase programs the company repurchased 8540 million of its common stock in 2018 903 million in 2017 and 52 million in 2016 as of december 31 2018 approximately 15 billion remained available for share repurchases under the program 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to expand our product portfolio to include more valueadded steel mill products improve our cost structure enhance our operational flexibility and provide additional channels to market for our products these investments total approximately 317 billion over the last three years with approximately twothirds going to capital expenditures and approximately onethird going to acquisitions we believe that our focus on lowering costs will enable us to execute on our strategy of delivering profitable longterm growth further we believe shifting our product mix to a greater portion of valueadded products and increasing enduser market diversity will make us less susceptible to imports 

several new capital projects that align with our expansion of valueadded product offerings and costreduction strategies are expected to be completed in 2019 at our sheet mill located in ghent kentucky nucor’s approximately 176 million investment in a new hot band galvanizing and pickling line is expected to be operational in the first half of 2019 we believe the new galvanizing line will be the widest hotrolled galvanizing line in north america with its 72inch product creating synergies with nucor’s other sheet mills and allowing us to enter new automotive market segments our nucor steel arkansas facility is building an additional specialty cold mill at an estimated cost of 230 million that is expected to be operational in the first half of 2019 that cold mill facility will expand our ability to produce advanced highstrength lowalloy and motor lamination steel products 

  

we have several growth initiatives underway in our bar mill group with expected completion dates in 2019 that will capitalize on our position as a lowcost producer of bar nucor is building a rebar micro mill capable of producing approximately 350000 tons annually near kansas city in sedalia missouri at an estimated cost of 250 million we believe that positioning the micro mill near the kansas city market will provide us with a freight cost advantage relative to more distant suppliers and we will also benefit from the scrap supply in the immediate area provided by our existing djj operations we expect startup of the new mill in late 2019 nucor steel kankakee inc is building a fullrange merchant bar quality mill with approximately 500000 tons of annual capacity at our existing mill in bourbonnais illinois at an estimated cost of 180 million like the new micro mill we believe that the kankakee mill will also benefit from logistical advantages and lowcost scrap supply we expect this project to be completed in late 2019 nucor is also updating the rolling mill at nucor steel marion inc the approximately 85 million modernization project is expected to be completed in mid2019 and will allow us to reduce the mill’s operating costs and better serve customers in ohio and the surrounding states 

additionally nucor has recently announced several major investments that are also in the steel mills segment in march 2018 nucor announced that it will build a second rebar micro mill capable of producing approximately 350000 tons annually in frostproof florida similar to the mill under construction in sedalia missouri we believe this new micro mill will benefit from the scrap supply in the immediate area provided by our existing djj operations this approximately 240 million investment is expected to be operational in the first half of 2020 in may 2018 nucor announced an approximately 240 million investment to construct a new galvanizing line with an annual capacity of approximately 500000 tons at our nucor steel arkansas facility this project complements the previously mentioned specialty cold mill project currently underway at the facility and we believe it will accelerate our goal of increasing our automotive market share the new galvanizing line is expected to be operational in the first half of 2021 in september 2018 nucor announced an approximately 650 million investment to expand the production capability at its flatrolled sheet mill located in ghent kentucky this investment will increase the production capability from approximately 1600000 tons to approximately 3000000 tons annually and will increase the maximum coil width to approximately 73 inches this expansion is expected to be completed in mid2021 and complements the previously mentioned hot band galvanizing and pickling line that is currently under construction as part of our initiative to further grow our sheet business most recently in january 2019 nucor announced plans to build a stateoftheart plate mill in the us midwest with an expected investment of 135 billion we expect the mill to be completed in 2022 and to be capable of producing approximately 1200000 tons per year of steel plate products 

nucor’s steel products segment has also grown significantly in recent years through the acquisitions of the companies that make up our nucor tubular products group nucor tubular products consists of the independence tube corporation acquired in october 2016 southland tube inc acquired in january 2017 republic conduit acquired in january 2017 and the assets of century tube llc acquired in december 2018 the combined purchase price of these acquisitions was approximately 898 million nucor tubular products is optimizing the teams and assets of the eight strategically located facilities to create leadership positions in the following markets hollow structural section “hss” steel tubing piling sprinkler pipe steel electrical conduit and mechanical tube for the automotive market the group has been well received in all markets as demonstrated by growth in revenue and volume shipped the nucor tubular products group provides nucor with a new line of valueadded products to offer our customers and a valueadded channel to market as the businesses are consumers of nucor’s hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel 

the steel products segment has also experienced recent growth as well through the september 2017 acquisition of st louis cold drawn inc “st louis” for approximately 60 million with a manufacturing location in st louis missouri and another location in monterrey mexico st louis is able to manufacture approximately 200000 tons annually of cold drawn rounds hexagons squares and special sections to serve the us and mexican automotive and industrial markets the st louis acquisition also provides an additional channel to market for the special bar quality “sbq” products that we produce at some of our bar mills also within our steel products segment we have recently acquired the assets of several businesses that will expand our 

  

bar grating presence in the united states and provide us with joist and deck production capabilities in eastern and western canada to better serve our customers in the canadian markets 

in addition to growing through capital expansions at our existing operations and acquisitions nucor also uses joint ventures as a platform for growth in 2016 we announced the formation of a joint venture nucorjfe with jfe steel corporation of japan in which nucor will have 50 ownership in a plant that is being built in central mexico to supply galvanized sheet steel to the growing mexican automotive market the plant which is expected to be operational in the second half of 2019 will have a total cost of approximately 300 million 50 of which provided by nucor and will have an annual capacity of approximately 400000 tons nucor’s sheet mills are expected to provide approximately half of the hotrolled steel substrate that will be consumed by the joint venture 

segments 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials the steel mills segment is nucor’s largest segment representing approximately 65 of the company’s sales to external customers in the year ended december 31 2018 

principal products produced 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces sheet steel hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks hpiling and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar and sbq nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces “eafs” continuous casting and automated rolling mills the steel mills segment also includes nucor’s equity method investments in duferdofin nucor srl numit llc and nucorjfe as well as nucor’s steel trading businesses and rebar distribution businesses in the steel products segment nucor produces hss steel tubing electrical conduit steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh the steel products segment also includes our piling distributor in the raw materials segment nucor produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas drilling operations 

markets and marketing 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada mexico nucor produces hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized sheet steel to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders we estimate that approximately 75 of our sheet steel sales in 2018 were to contract customers the balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale the proportion of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors including our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons in a manner to meet our customers’ requirements while considering the expected profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in the current marketbased indices andor raw material costs at or near the time of shipment these sheet sales contracts typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant 

our plate structural reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders in addition our bar mill group manufactures hotrolled sbq products to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors the significant majority of our plate structural rebar merchant bar and sbq steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices 

  

in 2018 approximately 80 of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers the remaining 20 of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our tubular products piling distributor joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 

one of nucor’s strategies for growth is expanding the channels by which our steel mills’ products can reach enduse customers the percentage of shipments consumed internally increased from 16 in 2016 to 20 in 2018 due to some of the recent investments in our downstream business such as the tubular products plants and st louis that consume steel produced by our steel mills 

in the steel products segment we sell steel joists and joist girders and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the united states and canada we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longerterm supply contracts may or may not permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs we sell and install fabricated reinforcing products primarily on a construction contract bid basis these products are used by contractors in constructing highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings we manufacture cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders we sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the united states and canada 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces we also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad the markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions 

in the raw materials segment we process ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in our steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers we also broker ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes supply ferroalloys and provide transportation material handling and other services to users of scrap metals our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are eaf steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2018 approximately 10 of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons we processed were sold to external customers we consumed the balance in our steel mills 

also within the raw materials segment are our dri plants in trinidad and louisiana that produce high quality iron inputs able to be used in our steel mills’ melting process and our natural gas production operations all natural gas produced by the drilling operations is and will be sold to outside parties 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service 

our eaf steel mills face many different forms of competition including integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other eaf steel mills foreign imports and alternative materials large domestic integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs eaf steel mill producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with large integrated steel producers 

  

excess global steelmaking capacity particularly in nonmarket economies continues to be a significant challenge for nucor and the entire us steel industry steel production in china rose in 2018 going from approximately 960 million tons in 2017 to approximately 102 billion tons in 2018 – an increase of 66 china’s share of global crude steel production rose from 503 in 2017 to 513 in 2018 the organisation for economic cooperation and development estimates that global excess steel production capacity was approximately 600 million tons at the end of 2017 a drop from its peak levels in 2015 and 2016 nearly half of that excess capacity is located in china where the largest steel companies are stateowned and receive significant financial support from the chinese government 

the section 232 steel tariffs are having their intended impact by preventing the dumping of steel products in the us market for the full year 2018 steel imports were down more than 10 from the previous year and imports accounted for approximately 23 of us market share about 41 million fewer tons of imports entered the united states in 2018 ninety percent of the decrease in imports took place after the tariffs were fully implemented on june 1 2018 the strong economy and lower imports generated 5 to 6 million tons in increased production for the us steel industry this year the comprehensive nature of the section 232 tariffs are also preventing the transshipment of artificially lowcost steel through third party countries 

the us government is negotiating with several other countries to change the terms of our trading relationship with them agreements have been reached with brazil argentina and south korea which exempted these countries from the steel tariffs in exchange for quotas limiting their exports of steel to the united states the united states also reached a new trade agreement with canada and mexico – the united statesmexicocanada agreement – though the steel tariffs still apply to those two countries trade negotiations are ongoing with china the eu and japan these negotiations particularly with china provide an opportunity to address the structural issues that encourage excess steel capacity which we believe would create a sustainable level playing field international efforts to address overcapacity namely the g20 global forum on steel excess capacity also continue failure to curb production overcapacity particularly if the section 232 tariffs are lifted in the future would risk the resumption of steel dumping in the us market by foreign competitors 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives become more attractive to our customers 

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 208 billion and 162 billion at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from other nucor businesses nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 226 billion and 183 billion at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively the majority of these orders will be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally 

sources and availability of raw materials 

for the past decade nucor has focused on securing access to lowcost raw material inputs as they are the company’s largest expense nucor’s broad balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallic inputs our investment in dri production facilities and scrap yards as well as our access to international 

  

raw materials markets provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw material costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj give us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus help us mitigate the risk of significant price fluctuations in input costs 

the primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron dri and hbi on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel djj operates six regional scrap companies within the united states that have a combined annual scrap processing capability of approximately 5000000 tons djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate dri plants in trinidad and louisiana with respective capacities of approximately 2000000 and 2500000 metric tons annually the primary raw material for our dri facilities is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers 

in october 2016 nucor concluded several transactions to improve its access to a longterm supply of natural gas nucor purchased 49 of encana oil  gas usa inc’s “encana” leasehold interest covering approximately 54000 acres in the south piceance basin the determination of whether or not to participate and invest in all future drilling capital investment by one working interest owner is independent of the other working interest owners as such nucor has full discretion on its participation in all future drilling capital investments nucor retains all existing producing wells it currently owns to support nucor’s operating wells and potential future well developments on the approximately 54000 acres nucor has entered into longterm agreements directly with existing thirdparty gathering and processing service providers 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills 

djj generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in nucor’s steel mills djj does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the availability and price of ferrous scrap and other metallic inputs such as iron ore are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products 

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges and our natural gas drilling operations 

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefited from relatively stable and competitive energy costs the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today by many factors including fuel switching coal to natural gas by public utilities changes in supply and demand and pipeline and export infrastructure expansion because energy is such a significant cost for nucor we strive continually to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace 

environmental laws and regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment the principal federal environmental laws include the clean air act that regulates air 

  

emissions the clean water act the “cwa” that regulates water discharges and withdrawals the resource conservation and recovery act the “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “cercla” that governs releases of and remediation of sites contaminated by hazardous substances our operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws 

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations 

nucor uses eafs to recycle scrap metal and scrap substitutes into new steel products these eafs use electricity as their primary source of energy as the trump administration revisits any number of recently implemented environmental regulations such as greenhouse gas “ghg” regulations air toxics rules and emissions standards imposed on coalfired electric utilities it is reasonable to assume that any cost implications would be delayed until those reviews are complete 

the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available 

the rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes the rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling and storage of most wastes while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered these activities and offsite properties that the us environmental protection agency the “epa” has determined are contaminated for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level are quickly evaluated and corrected while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under the rcra these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved 

because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under the cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor continually evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under the rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them 

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment this filtrant eaf dust is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both the cercla and the rcra 

nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives such as 

  

reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use and has implemented sitewide recycling programs many of our facilities have incorporated energy efficiency targets to reduce both cost and environmental impacts into their environmental management systems these environmental management systems help facilitate compliance with our environmental commitment which is every nucor teammate’s responsibility nucor’s environmental program maintains a high level of ongoing training commitment outreach and visibility 

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to innovate our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff we have slightly more than 100 employees in our principal executive offices the vast majority of nucor’s approximately 26300 employees as of december 31 2018 are not represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the current global steelmaking capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development global steel production overcapacity was approximately 600 million tons at the end of 2017 with nearly half that amount located in china overcapacity is down from its peak in 2015 and 2016 efforts by china to close inefficient steel production and improve air quality steel mill closures in europe and stronger global economic growth all contributed to reduce excess capacity 

during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

section 232 steel tariffs are keeping dumped steel products out of the us market international efforts to reduce global steel production overcapacity such as the g20 global forum on steel excess capacity are 

  

ongoing the us government is also negotiating new or renegotiating existing trade agreements which provide another opportunity to address excess steelmaking capacity should these efforts fail to reduce excess capacity and the section 232 tariffs be lifted us steelmakers would be at risk of having to compete again against steel products dumped in the us market 

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy metals service centers appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the us economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows general economic conditions in the united states and steel demand in this country are currently stronger than in many parts of the world but challenges from global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties in other regions of the world remain 

while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions future economic downturns or a prolonged slowgrowth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

competition from other steel producers imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business 

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including raw materials cost and availability energy technology labor and capital costs government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

since 2011 automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing demand for steel in north america certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our steel products the raw material required to produce dri is pelletized iron ore although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors at any given 

  

time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions including physical or information systems related issues that impact the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our steelmaking processes our dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs the regulation of these ghgs through new rulemaking or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent ghg regulations are further implemented because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations we are already impacted in the permit modification and reporting processes both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national air ambient quality standards which are more restrictive than previous standards make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits 

these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased and continue to increase the cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is mitigating some of this indirect impact as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly however because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices in 2018 the epa proposed the affordable clean energy rule to replace the promulgated clean power plan that was driving many utilities to shutter coal fired power plants however there is a significant degree of uncertainty with respect to the results of this change in regulatory direction to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy they could have an impact on nucor’s competitive position 

  

while the federal government appears to be moving to relax burdensome regulations some states are moving to enact their own regulations of carbon and other ghg emissions if such regulations are enacted in states in which nucor does business it could negatively affect those operations numerous states including california washington oregon and new york are considering or have passed laws using environmental product declarations “epd” to evaluate environmental impacts of products the impacts identified by epds could impact future stateconsumer purchasing decisions california has implemented the “buy clean california act” and california is currently requesting epds from manufacturers to be used in state of california funded projects epds will be required for certain materials including some steel products after january 1 2020 global warming potentials “gwp” will be established by january 1 2021 for applicable product categories and epds will be used to determine product compliance to the gwp limits because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and accordingly we make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates nucor has implemented the revised epa rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the united states to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag mill scale iron dusts lime and air filtration control dusts to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes critical equipment failures acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as 

  

intellectual property and proprietary business information despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations threats from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel resulting in lost revenues as well as delays in reporting our financial results we also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems liability for stolen information increased cybersecurity protection costs litigation expense and increased insurance premiums 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2018 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 31 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds shortterm commercial paper issuance or from borrowings under our 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources 

risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states in europe mexico and in emerging markets there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets these risks include but are not limited to unfavorable political or economic factors local labor and social issues changes in regulatory requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and complex foreign laws treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations 

tax increases and changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the united states nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations contractual obligations and other legal standards notwithstanding this we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues including regulatory safety environmental employment transportation intellectual property contractual importexport international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings see item 3 “legal proceedings” a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them 

  

interest rate risk – nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2018 approximately 24 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly the remaining 76 of nucor’s longterm debt was at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2018 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk – in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in periods of strong or stable demand for our products we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for our products is weaker this becomes more challenging our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs dri is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic production 

natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states for the year ended december 31 2018 the volume of natural gas sold from our drilling operations was approximately 15 of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities 

nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2018 accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes included 65 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2018 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk – nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and mexico we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2018 and 2017 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation and its affiliates “nucor” the “company” “we” “us” or “our” manufacture steel and steel products the company also produces direct reduced iron “dri” for use in its steel mills through the david j joseph company and its affiliates “djj” the company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and dri most of the company’s operating facilities and customers are located in north america the company’s operations include international trading and sales companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the company and others 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2017 we recycled approximately 188 million tons of scrap steel 

general development of our business in recent years 

the significant developments in nucor’s business in recent years have aligned with our capital allocation strategy our highest capital allocation priority is to invest in our business for profitable longterm growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing existing operations acquisitions and greenfield expansions our second priority is to provide our stockholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in delivering longterm earnings growth our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when our cash position is strong and attractively priced growth opportunities are limited 

nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to expand our product portfolio to include more valueadded steel mill products improve our cost structure enhance our operational flexibility and provide additional channels to market for our products these investments total 253 billion over the last three years with approximately twothirds going to capital expenditures and approximately onethird going to acquisitions we believe that our focus on lowering cost will enable us to execute on our strategy of delivering profitable longterm growth shifting our product mix to a greater portion of valueadded products and increasing enduser market diversity will make us less susceptible to imports 

the following recently completed projects to optimize operations at existing facilities within our steel mills segment illustrate nucor’s execution on the valueadded product expansion and cost improvement aspects of our strategy the final components of nucor’s 290 million project at our south carolina nebraska and tennessee bar mills were completed in 2015 to expand our special bar quality “sbq” and wire rod production capabilities by approximately 1000000 tons these sbq projects allow us to produce engineered bar for more demanding applications that are less exposed to imports while maintaining our position as a lowcost commodity bar producer by shifting production of rebar to our other bar mills additionally our nucoryamato steel company “nucoryamato” joint venture recently completed two major capital projects to broaden its product offerings nucoryamato completed a 115 million project in late 2014 to add several additional sheet piling sections which are wider lighter and stronger covering more area at a lower installed cost the joint venture also began shipping structural steel from its 75 million quench and selftempering line in late 2016 which makes that mill the sole north american producer of certain highstrength lowalloy structural sections 

nucor also recently announced several new capital projects with 2019 targeted completion dates which align with our expansion of valueadded product offerings and costreduction strategies our nucor steel arkansas facility is building an additional cold mill at an estimated cost of 230 million that cold mill facility will expand our ability to produce advanced highstrength lowalloy and motor lamination steel products at our sheet mill located in ghent kentucky which we acquired in 2014 nucor recently announced plans to expand the 1600000 tonsperyear mill by building a hot band galvanizing line for approximately 176 million we believe 

  

the new galvanizing line will be the widest hotrolled galvanizing line in north america with its 72inch product allowing us to enter new automotive market segments nucor has also recently announced several major investments within our bar mill group which will capitalize on our position as a lowcost producer of bar nucor will build a 350000 tonsperyear rebar micro mill near kansas city in sedalia missouri at an estimated cost of 250 million we believe that positioning the micro mill near the kansas city market will provide us with a freight cost advantage relative to more distant suppliers and we will also benefit from the scrap supply in the immediate area provided by our existing djj operations the second bar mill growth initiative is nucor steel kankakee inc’s plan to build a 180 million full range merchant bar mill with 500000 tons of annual capacity at our existing mill in bourbonnais illinois like the new micro mill we believe that the kankakee mill will also benefit from logistical advantages and lowcost scrap supply finally nucor has begun construction on an 85 million modernization project at our marion ohio bar mill which will allow us to reduce our operating costs 

nucor’s steel mills segment has also grown significantly in recent years through the acquisitions of a plate mill in longview texas “longview” independence tube corporation “independence tube” southland tube inc “southland” and republic conduit “republic” acquired during the third quarter of 2016 for approximately 29 million longview is able to produce approximately 125000 tons annually of higher valueadded carbon and alloy plate products that can range from 1 to 12 inches thick and up to 138 inches wide we completed the acquisition of independence tube during the fourth quarter of 2016 for approximately 430 million and we completed the acquisition of southland in january 2017 for approximately 130 million from their five facilities in alabama and illinois independence tube and southland are able to produce over 800000 tons annually of hollow structural section “hss” steel tubing used primarily in nonresidential construction markets in january 2017 nucor also completed the acquisition of republic a steel electrical conduit manufacturer with plants in georgia and kentucky for approximately 332 million these three pipe and tube businesses provide nucor with a new line of valueadded products to offer our customers and they provide a valueadded channel to market as the businesses are consumers of nucor’s hotrolled sheet steel 

the steel products segment has experienced recent growth as well through the september 2017 acquisition of st louis cold drawn inc “st louis” for approximately 60 million with a manufacturing location in st louis missouri and another location in monterrey mexico st louis is able to manufacture approximately 200000 tons annually of cold drawn rounds hexagons squares and special sections to serve the us and mexican automotive and industrial markets the st louis acquisition also provides an additional channel to market for the sbq products that we produce at some of our bar mills also within our steel products segment we have recently acquired the assets of several businesses that will expand our bar grating presence in the united states and provide us with joist and deck production capabilities in eastern and western canada to better serve our customers in canadian markets 

in addition to growing through capital expansions at existing operations and acquisitions nucor also uses joint ventures as a platform for growth in 2016 we announced the formation of a joint venture with jfe steel corporation of japan in which nucor will have 50 ownership in a plant that is being built in central mexico to supply galvanized sheet steel to the growing mexican automotive market the plant which is expected to be operational in the second half of 2019 will cost approximately 270 million and will have an annual capacity of approximately 400000 tons nucor’s sheet mills are expected to provide approximately half of the hotrolled steel substrate that will be consumed by the joint venture 

nucor’s second capital allocation priority is to provide our stockholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in delivering longterm earnings growth nucor has paid 145 billion in dividends to its stockholders during the past three years that dividend payout represents 29 of cash flows from operations during that threeyear period 

our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock in 2015 nucor’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to 9000 million of shares of its common stock the company repurchased 903 million shares of its common 

  

stock in 2017 52 million in 2016 and 665 million in 2015 as of december 31 2017 approximately 7380 million remained available for repurchase under the program 

segments 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2017 are set forth in note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in nucor’s 2017 annual report to stockholders which is incorporated by reference the steel mills segment is nucor’s largest segment representing approximately 72 of the company’s sales to external customers in the year ended december 31 2017 

principal products produced 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces sheet steel hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized hss steel tubing electrical conduit plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks hpiling and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar and special bar quality nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills the steel mills segment also includes nucor’s equity method investments in duferdofin nucor srl “duferdofin nucor” and numit llc “numit” as well as nucor’s steel trading businesses and rebar distribution businesses in the steel products segment nucor produces steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh in the raw materials segment nucor produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas drilling operations 

markets and marketing 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada mexico and elsewhere in the world nucor produces hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized sheet steel to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders we estimate that approximately 65 of our sheet steel sales in 2017 were to contract customers the balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale the proportion of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors including our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons in a manner to meet our customers’ requirements while considering the expected profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in the current marketbased indices andor raw material costs near the time of shipment these sheet sales contracts typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant 

our tubular plate structural reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders in addition our bar mill group manufactures hotrolled sbq products to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors almost all of our tubular plate structural rebar merchant bar and sbq steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices 

in 2017 approximately 83 of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers the remaining 17 of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our tubular products mills our piling distributor and our downstream joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 

  

one of nucor’s strategies for growth is expanding the channels by which our steel mills’ products can reach enduser customers the percentage of shipments consumed internally has increased from 14 in 2016 due to some of the recent investments in our business such as the tubular products plants and st louis that consume steel produced by our steel mills 

in the steel products segment we sell steel joists and joist girders and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the united states and canada we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longerterm supply contracts may or may not permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs we sell and install fabricated reinforcing products primarily on a construction contract bid basis these products are used by contractors in constructing highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings we manufacture cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders we sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the united states and canada 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces we also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad the markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions 

in the raw materials segment we process ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in our steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers we also broker ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes supply ferroalloys and provide transportation material handling and other services to users of scrap metals our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are electric arc furnace steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2017 approximately 10 of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons we processed were sold to external customers we consumed the balance in our steel mills 

also within the raw materials segment are our dri plants in trinidad and louisiana that produce high quality iron inputs able to be used in our steel mills’ melting process as well as our natural gas production operations all natural gas produced by the drilling operations is and will be sold to outside parties 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service 

our electric arc furnace steel mills face many different forms of competition including integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other electric arc furnace steel mills foreign imports and alternative materials large domestic integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs electric arc furnace steel mill producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with large integrated steel producers 

excess global steelmaking capacity particularly in nonmarket economies continues to be a significant challenge for nucor and the entire us steel industry with the us economy performing better than most other 

  

economies around the world and a strong us dollar the us steel market is the destination of choice for global steel producers in 2017 total steel imports increased by more than 15 compared to 2016 finished imports last year captured an estimated 27 market share as a result the domestic steel industry has continued to aggressively pursue trade cases to curb unfairly traded imports 

competition from foreign steel and steel product producers presents unique challenges for us imported steel and steel products often benefit from government subsidies either directly or indirectly through governmentowned enterprises or governmentowned or controlled financial institutions china which accounts for almost half of the steel produced annually in the world is the prime example of how some foreign governments impact the global steel market nucor believes that chinese producers many of which are governmentowned in whole or in part benefit from their government’s manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates and from the receipt of government subsidies which allow them to sell their products below cost other foreign governments utilize similar tactics to artificially lower their steel production costs these distorting trade practices are widely recognized as being unfair and have been challenged successfully as violating world trade rules in 2017 the us department of commerce made favorable rulings in trade cases involving steel plate rebar and wire rod 

efforts by foreign companies to evade duties by routing products through thirdparty countries is also a challenge artificiallypriced imports and duty evasion schemes make it very difficult for nucor to maintain sales prices and profit levels as a result nucor joined three other steelmakers in filing a petition alleging china is circumventing coated steel sheet duties by shipping product through vietnam at the end of the year us steel producers also received a favorable ruling in this case when the us department of commerce made a preliminary determination that corrosionresistant and coldrolled steel from vietnam that originated in china evaded us antidumping and antisubsidy orders a final determination is expected to be announced in the first quarter of 2018 

the us government continues to treat china as a nonmarket economy despite china’s insistence that it should be recognized as a market economy under its protocol of accession to the world trade organization the “protocol” china was a governmentrun nonmarket economy in 2001 when it entered the protocol and china remains a governmentrun nonmarket economy today the main objective of the protocol was to encourage and in some cases to require china to make marketbased economic reforms however over the past 16 years china has failed to take the required steps to establish that it is a market economy under us law therefore the united states had no reason to change its treatment of china as a nonmarket economy when one of the relevant provisions of the protocol expired in december 2016 by treating china as a nonmarket economy in antidumping cases the us department of commerce can assume that chinese prices and costs are distorted and may use other methodologies to calculate antidumping duties this often results in appropriately higher duties against chinese products in order to offset its unfair trade practices china has filed a challenge to the us decision with the world trade organization 

aggressive trade practices left unchallenged seriously undermine the ability of nucor and other domestic producers to compete on price competition from countries with subsidized production costs has significantly contributed to the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the united states when such an exodus occurs the us economy is weakened and nucor’s customer base is diminished rigorous trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign producers that engage in unlawful trade practices nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives become more attractive to our customers 

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal 

  

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 187 billion and 152 billion at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from other nucor businesses nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 158 billion and 140 billion at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the majority of these orders will be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally 

sources and availability of raw materials 

for the past decade nucor has focused on securing access to lowcost raw material inputs as they are the company’s largest expense nucor’s broad balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallic inputs our investment in dri production facilities and scrap yards as well as our access to international raw materials markets provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw materials costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj give us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus help us mitigate the risk of significant price fluctuations in input costs 

the primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron dri and hbi on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel djj operates six regional scrap companies within the united states that have a combined annual scrap processing capability of approximately 5000000 tons djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate dri plants in trinidad and louisiana with respective capacities of approximately 2000000 and 2500000 metric tons annually the primary raw material for our dri facilities is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers 

in october 2016 nucor concluded several transactions to improve its access to a longterm supply of natural gas nucor purchased 49 of encana oil  gas usa inc’s “encana” leasehold interest covering approximately 54000 acres in the south piceance basin further nucor and encana also terminated the two carry and earning “ce” drilling agreements entered into in 2010 and 2012 and nucor sold its 50 equity interest in hunter ridge energy services llc “hunter ridge” to encana hunter ridge is a gas gathering and water service provider formed by nucor and encana in 2012 to support the joint well development in the north piceance basin in the new arrangement the determination of whether or not to participate and invest in all future drilling capital investment by one working interest owner is independent of the other working interest owners as such nucor has full discretion on its participation in all future drilling capital investments by canceling the ce drilling agreements nucor has eliminated all future carry capital and all contingent liabilities associated with those contracts which should result in lower unit cost for any future drilling nucor retains all existing producing wells it currently owns to support nucor’s operating wells and potential future well developments on the approximately 54000 acres nucor has entered into longterm agreements directly with existing thirdparty gathering and processing service providers 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills 

djj generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in nucor’s steel mills djj does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the availability and price of ferrous scrap and other metallic inputs such as iron ore are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products 

  

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges and our natural gas drilling operations 

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefited from relatively stable and competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on an equal footing in the increasingly global marketplace the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today however by many factors including changes in supply and demand advances in drilling technology and increasingly changes in public policy relating to energy production and use because energy is such a significant cost for nucor we strive continually to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace 

environmental laws and regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment the principal federal environmental laws include the clean air act that regulates air emissions the clean water act the “cwa” that regulates water discharges and withdrawals the resource conservation and recovery act the “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the “cercla” that governs releases of and remediation of sites contaminated by hazardous substances our operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws 

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations 

nucor uses electric arc furnaces “eafs” to recycle scrap metal and scrap substitutes into new steel products these eafs use electricity as their primary source of energy as the trump administration revisits any number of recently implemented environmental regulations such as greenhouse gas “ghg” regulations air toxics rules and emissions standards imposed on coalfired electric utilities it is reasonable to assume that any cost implications would be delayed until those reviews are complete 

the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available 

the rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes the rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling and storage of most wastes while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered these activities and offsite properties that the us environmental protection agency the “epa” has determined are contaminated for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level are quickly evaluated and corrected while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under the rcra these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved 

because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under the cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor continually evaluates these 

  

types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under the rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them 

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment this filtrant eaf dust is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both the cercla and the rcra 

nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use and has implemented sitewide recycling programs many of our facilities have incorporated energy efficiency targets to reduce both cost and environmental impacts into their environmental management systems these environmental management systems help facilitate compliance with our environmental commitment which is every nucor teammate’s responsibility nucor’s environmental program maintains a high level of ongoing training commitment outreach and visibility 

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2018 and 2019 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to innovate our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff we have slightly more than 100 employees in our principal executive offices the vast majority of nucor’s approximately 25100 employees as of december 31 2017 are not represented by labor unions 

available information 

nucor’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports are available on our website at wwwnucorcom as soon as reasonably practicable after nucor files these reports electronically with or furnishes them to the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” except as otherwise stated in these reports the information contained on our website or available by hyperlink from our website is not incorporated into this report or other documents we file with or furnish to the sec

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the current global steelmaking capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows overcapacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china brazil and other countries 

the g20 global forum on steel excess capacity citing data from the organisation for economic cooperation  development and the world steel association reports that in 2016 global steel production overcapacity was estimated at approximately 812000000 tons per year with china being the largest contributor to overcapacity total steel imports into the united states increased more than 15 in 2017 compared to the prior year excess capacity results in steel and steel products which would otherwise have been consumed by the local steel customers being displaced into global markets and thereby putting our steel and steel products at a competitive disadvantage 

the domestic steel market could experience a contraction in exports at the same time as imports grow due to weakening conditions in europe and policies of foreign governments that result in overvaluing the us dollar against other foreign currencies furthermore the addition of new capacity in the united states could exacerbate the issue of overcapacity domestically as well as globally 

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy metals service centers appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the us economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the united states has recently experienced modest growth in the general economy and steel demand in this country is stronger than in many parts of the world the global and domestic steel industries continue to face significant challenges these challenges are caused by global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties in other regions of the world these situations can contribute to weaker endmarkets and depressed demand for domestically produced steel and steel products potentially resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results 

the economic outlook for our industry remains uncertain both in the united states and globally while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for domestically produced steel and steel products below the 2007 prerecession levels future economic downturns or a prolonged slowgrowth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

competition from other steel producers imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business 

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including raw materials cost and 

  

availability energy technology labor and capital costs government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

since 2011 automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further oversupply of steel in north america certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

our steelmaking processes dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs the regulation of these ghgs through new rulemaking or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent ghg regulations are further implemented because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations we are already impacted in the permit modification and reporting processes both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national air ambient quality standards which are more restrictive than previous standards make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits 

these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased and continue to increase the cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly however because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices the epa has recently announced that it will be replacing the previously promulgated clean power plan that was driving many utilities to shutter coal fired power plants at this time there is a significant degree of uncertainty with respect to the results of this change in regulatory direction to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy they could have an impact on nucor’s competitive position 

while the federal government appears to be moving to relax burdensome regulations some states are moving to enact their own regulations of carbon and other ghg emissions if such regulations are enacted in states in which nucor does business it could negatively affect those operations because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates the epa has recently revised the rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the united states to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag mill scale iron dusts lime and air filtration control dusts to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions 

  

will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes unplanned critical equipment failures acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations threats from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel resulting in lost revenues as well as delays in reporting our financial results we also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems liability for stolen information increased cybersecurity protection costs litigation expense and increased insurance premiums 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2017 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 33 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources 

risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states in europe mexico and in emerging markets there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets these risks include but are not limited to unfavorable political or economic factors local labor and social issues changes in regulatory requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and complex foreign laws treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing 

  

for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations 

tax increases and changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 significantly affected the way usbased multinational companies are taxed nucor expects to benefit from the act’s domestic corporate tax law changes which will decrease the company’s effective tax rate and cash tax liabilities the international portions of the act which transition the us tax regime from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and provide for us tax on certain types of foreign income may cause tax increases on the company’s foreign operations it is unclear the extent to which us states will change their rates and tax base in response to the tax cuts and jobs act but changes could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations contractual obligations and other legal standards notwithstanding this we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues including regulatory safety environmental employment transportation intellectual property contractual importexport international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings see item 3 “legal proceedings” a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk – nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2017 approximately 27 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly the remaining 73 of nucor’s longterm debt was at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2017 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk – in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in periods of strong or stable demand for our products we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for our products is weaker this becomes more challenging our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs dri is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic production 

  

natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states for the year ended december 31 2017 the volume of natural gas sold from our drilling operations was approximately 21 of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities 

nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2017 accumulated other comprehensive loss included 28 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2017 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income taxes or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk – nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and mexico we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2017 and 2016 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation and its affiliates “nucor” the “company” or “we” manufacture steel and steel products the company also produces direct reduced iron “dri” for use in the company’s steel mills through the david j joseph company and its affiliates “djj” the company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and dri most of the company’s operating facilities and customers are located in north america but nucor does business outside of north america as well the company’s operations include several international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the company and others 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2016 we recycled approximately 176 million tons of scrap steel 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to expand our product portfolio to include more valueadded steel mill products improve our cost structure enhance our operational flexibility and provide additional channels to market for our products our investments total almost 6 billion over the last five years with approximately twothirds going to capital expenditures and onethird going to acquisitions we believe that our focus on lowering cost will enable us to execute on our strategy of delivering profitable growth shifting our product mix to a greater portion of valueadded products and increasing enduser market diversity will make us less susceptible to imports 

the following projects at facilities within our steel mills segment illustrate nucor’s execution on the valueadded product expansion and cost improvement aspects of our strategy at our hertford county north carolina plate mill a series of expansions including a heat treat line a normalizing line and a vacuum tank degasser were completed in 2013 those projects have positioned the mill to increase its diversity of product offerings to be less exposed to imports and have allowed us to improve the product mix allocation between our plate mills and sheet mills to improve margins at those facilities the final components of nucor’s 290 million project at our south carolina nebraska and tennessee bar mills to expand our special bar quality “sbq” and wire rod production capabilities by approximately one million tons were completed in 2015 these sbq projects are an important component of our strategy because they allow us to produce engineered bar for more demanding applications that are less exposed to imports while maintaining our position as a lowcost commodity bar producer by shifting production to our other bar mills in 2014 our berkeley county south carolina mill successfully started up its nearly 100 million capital project that allows us to produce wider and thinner highstrength steel grades that can be used in a wide range of end use markets including metal buildings rail cars water heaters automotive heavy equipment and motor lamination additionally our nucoryamato steel company “nucoryamato” joint venture has recently completed two major capital projects to broaden its product offerings nucoryamato completed a 115 million project in late 2014 to add several additional sheet piling sections which expanded our product offerings to include wider piling sections that are lighter and stronger covering more area at a lower installed cost the joint venture also recently began shipping structural steel from its 75 million quench and selftempering line which will make that mill the sole north american producer of certain highstrength lowalloy structural sections in september 2016 nucor announced that it will add an additional cold mill at its nucor steel arkansas facility for an estimated 230 million that will expand our ability to produce advanced highstrength highstrength lowalloy and motor lamination steel products we expect that the new cold mill complex will be operational in approximately two years 

nucor’s steel mills segment has also grown significantly in recent years through the acquisitions of gallatin steel company “gallatin” a plate mill in longview texas “longview” and independence tube corporation 

  

“independence tube” as well as southland tube “southland” and republic conduit “republic” in early 2017 nucor acquired gallatin in 2014 for a cash purchase price of 779 million located on the ohio river in ghent kentucky gallatin has an annual sheet steel production capacity of approximately 1600000 tons and provides us with expanded access to the important midwestern united states steel market acquired during the third quarter of 2016 for approximately 29 million longview is able to produce 125000 tons annually of higher valueadded carbon and alloy plate products that can range from 1 to 12 inches thick and up to 138 inches wide nucor completed the acquisition of independence tube during the fourth quarter of 2016 for approximately 430 million and we completed the acquisition of southland for approximately 130 million in january 2017 from their five facilities in alabama and illinois independence tube and southland are able to produce over 800000 tons annually of hollow structural section hss tubing used primarily in nonresidential construction markets nucor also completed the acquisition of republic a steel electrical conduit manufacturer with plants in georgia and kentucky in january 2017 for approximately 335 million these three pipe and tube businesses provide nucor with a new line of valueadded products to offer our customers and they provide a valueadded channel to market as the businesses are consumers of nucor’s hotrolled sheet steel 

in addition to growing through capital expansions at existing operations and acquisitions nucor also uses joint ventures as a platform for growth we recently announced the formation of a joint venture with jfe steel corporation of japan in which nucor would have 50 ownership in a plant that will be built in central mexico to supply galvanized sheet steel to the growing mexican automotive market the plant which is expected to be operational in 2019 will cost approximately 270 million and will have an annual capacity of 400000 tons nucor’s sheet mills will provide approximately half of the hotrolled steel substrate that will be consumed by the joint venture 

a major emphasis of our cost improvement and operational flexibility plan relates to having more control over both the cost and reliable sourcing of our raw materials our 2500000 metric tonsperyear dri facility in st james parish louisiana began production in december 2013 the combination of our louisiana facility and our dri plant in trinidad with an annual capacity of 2000000 metric tons gives us the flexibility to optimize nucor’s overall iron units mix based on current market pricing for scrap and scrap substitutes to provide us with a low cost feedstock for our steel mills 

the dri production process requires significant volumes of natural gas on october 1 2016 nucor concluded several transactions to preserve its access to a longterm supply of low cost natural gas resources while maintaining capital flexibility nucor purchased 49 of encana oil  gas usa inc’s “encana” leasehold interest covering approximately 54000 acres in the south piceance basin terminated two carry  earning “ce” drilling agreements and sold its 50 interest in hunter ridge energy services llc “hunter ridge” in the new arrangement the determination of whether or not to participate and invest in all future drilling capital investment by one working interest owner is independent of other working interest owners nucor retains its interest in all existing producing wells that it currently owns 

segments 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2016 are set forth in note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in nucor’s 2016 annual report which is incorporated by reference the steel mills segment is nucor’s largest segment representing approximately 70 of the company’s sales to external customers in the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 

principal products produced 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces and distributes sheet steel hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized tubular products plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks hpiling and sheet 

  

piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar wire rod and sbq nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills nucor’s equity method investments in duferdofin nucor srl and numit llc are included in the steel mills segment also included in the steel mills segment are our distribution and international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products that nucor and other steel producers have manufactured in the steel products segment nucor produces steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems steel grating and wire and wire mesh in the raw materials segment the company produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas drilling operations 

markets and marketing 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada mexico and elsewhere in the world nucor produces hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized sheet steel to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders we estimate that approximately 60 of our sheet steel sales in 2016 were to contract customers the balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale the proportion of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors including our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons in a manner to meet our customers’ requirements while considering the expected profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in the current marketbased indices andor raw material costs near the time of shipment these sheet sales contracts typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant 

our tubular plate structural reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders in addition our bar mill group manufactures hotrolled sbq products to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors almost all of our tubular plate structural rebar merchant bar and sbq steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices 

in 2016 approximately 86 of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers the remaining 14 of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our tubular product maker our piling distributor and our downstream joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations one of nucor’s strategies for growth is expanding the channels by which our steel mills’ products can reach enduser customers we have a goal of increasing our volume sold to internal customers to 20 

in the steel products segment we sell steel joists and joist girders and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the united states and canada we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longerterm supply contracts may or may not permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs we sell and install fabricated reinforcing products primarily on a construction contract bid basis these products are used by contractors in constructing highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings we manufacture cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders we sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the united states and canada 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces we also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad the markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions 

  

in the raw materials segment we process ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in our steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers we also broker ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes supply ferroalloys and provide transportation material handling and other services to users of scrap metals our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are electric arc furnace steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2016 approximately 10 of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons we processed were sold to external customers we used the balance in our steel mills 

also within the raw materials segment are our dri plants in trinidad and louisiana that produce iron inputs exclusively for use in the nucor mills as well as our natural gas production operations all natural gas produced by the drilling operations is and will be sold to outside parties 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service 

our electric arc furnace steel mills face many different forms of competition including integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other electric arc furnace steel mills foreign imports and alternative materials large integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a wide variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs electric arc furnace steel mill producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with integrated steel producers 

excess global steelmaking capacity particularly in nonmarket economies continues to be a significant challenge for nucor and the entire us steel industry with the us economy performing better than most other economies around the world and a strong us dollar the us steel market is the destination of choice for global steel producers steel imports were down 15 in 2016 compared to 2015 finished imports last year captured 26 market share the effects of successful trade cases involving flatrolled products were an important step in returning fair trade to the us flatrolled steel market but challenges still remain in several product areas 

competition from foreign steel and steel product producers presents unique challenges for us imported steel and steel products often benefit from government subsidies either directly or indirectly through governmentowned enterprises or governmentowned or controlled financial institutions china which accounts for almost half of the steel produced annually in the world is the prime example of how some foreign governments impact the global steel market nucor believes that chinese producers many of which are governmentowned in whole or in part benefit from their government’s manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates and from the receipt of government subsidies which allow them to sell their products below cost other foreign governments utilize similar tactics to artificially lower their steel production costs these distorting trade practices are widely recognized as being unfair and have been challenged successfully as violating world trade rules in 2016 the us steel industry received positive determinations in trade cases involving three flatrolled products—corrosionresistant coldrolled and hotrolled steel the us department of commerce recently announced preliminary duty determinations in investigations addressing cuttolength plate from twelve countries the us department of commerce also announced the initiation of antidumping duty investigations of imports of steel concrete reinforcing bar from japan taiwan and turkey and a countervailing duty cvd investigation of steel concrete reinforcing bar imports from turkey we expect the plate and rebar cases to conclude in 2017 

  

efforts by foreign companies to evade duties by routing products through thirdparty countries is also a challenge artificiallypriced imports and duty evasion schemes make it very difficult for nucor to maintain sales prices and profit levels as a result nucor joined three other steelmakers in filing a petition alleging china is circumventing coated steel sheet duties by shipping product through vietnam 

the us government announced it will continue to treat china as a nonmarket economy despite china’s insistence that it should be recognized as a market economy under its protocol of accession to the world trade organization “protocol” china was a governmentrun nonmarket economy in 2001 when it entered its protocol and china remains a governmentrun nonmarket economy today the main objective of the protocol was to encourage and in some cases to require china to make marketbased economic reforms however over the past 15 years china has failed to take the required steps to establish that it is a market economy under us law therefore the united states had no reason to change its treatment of china as a nonmarket economy when one of the relevant provisions of the protocol expired in december 2016 by treating china as a nonmarket economy in antidumping cases the us department of commerce can assume that chinese prices and costs are distorted and may use other methodologies to calculate antidumping duties this often results in appropriately higher duties against chinese products in order to offset its unfair trade practices china has filed a challenge to the us decision with the world trade organization 

aggressive trade practices left unchallenged seriously undermine the ability of nucor and other domestic producers to compete on price competition from countries with subsidized production costs has significantly contributed to the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the united states when such an exodus occurs the us economy is weakened and nucor’s customer base is diminished rigorous trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign producers that engage in unlawful trade practices nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives become more attractive to our customers 

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 152 billion and 117 billion at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from our downstream businesses nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 140 billion and 135 billion at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the majority of these orders will be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally 

sources and availability of raw materials 

for the past decade nucor has focused on securing access to lowcost raw material inputs as they are the company’s largest expense nucor’s broad balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallics inputs our investment in dri production facilities and scrap yards as well as our access to international raw materials markets provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw materials costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes 

  

from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj give us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus help us mitigate the risk of significant price fluctuations in input costs 

the primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron dri and hbi on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel djj operates six regional scrap companies within the united states that have the combined annual scrap processing capability of over five million tons djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate dri plants in trinidad and louisiana with respective capacities of 2000000 and 2500000 metric tons annually the primary raw material for our dri facilities is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers 

in october 2016 nucor concluded several transactions to improve its access to a longterm supply of natural gas nucor purchased 49 of encana’s leasehold interest covering approximately 54000 acres in the south piceance basin further nucor and encana also terminated the two ce drilling agreements entered into in 2010 and 2012 and nucor sold its 50 equity interest in hunter ridge to encana hunter ridge is a gas gathering and water service provider formed by nucor and encana in 2012 to support the joint well development in the north piceance basin in the new arrangement the determination of whether or not to participate and invest in all future drilling capital investment by one working interest owner is independent of the other working interest owners as such nucor has full discretion on its participation in all future drilling capital investments by canceling the ce drilling agreements nucor has eliminated all future carry capital and all contingent liabilities associated with those contracts which should result in lower unit cost for any future drilling nucor retains all existing producing wells it currently owns to support nucor’s operating wells and potential future well developments on the 54000 acres nucor has entered into longterm agreements directly with existing third party gathering and processing service providers 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills 

djj generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in nucor’s steel mills djj does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the availability and price of ferrous scrap and other metallic inputs such as iron ore are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products 

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges and our natural gas drilling operations 

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefited from relatively stable and competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on an equal footing in the increasingly global marketplace the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today however by many factors including changes in supply and demand advances in drilling technology and increasingly changes in public policy relating to energy production and use because energy is such a significant cost for nucor we strive continually to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace 

  

environmental laws and regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment the principal federal environmental laws include the clean air act that regulates air emissions the clean water act “cwa” that regulates water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” that governs releases of and remediation of sites contaminated by hazardous substances our operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws 

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations 

the us environmental protection agency “usepa” issued a final rule regarding the clean power plan “cpp” while the cpp is directed at electric generating units as opposed to steelmaking operations nucor expects indirect impact through increased electric costs there are ongoing legal challenges to the cpp which will likely delay any potential adverse impacts to nucor additionally the current administration has given strong signals that their intention is to repeal this regulation if this regulation moves forward we expect the impacts will be spread over a significant timeframe mitigating these impacts on nucor’s operations 

nucor uses electric arc furnaces “eaf” to recycle scrap metal into new steel products these eafs use electricity as their primary source of energy as the new administration revisits any number of recently implemented environmental regulations such as greenhouse gas “ghg” regulations air toxics rules and emissions standards imposed on coalfired electric utilities it is reasonable to assume that any cost implications would be delayed until those reviews are complete 

the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available 

rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling of and storage of most wastes while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered these activities and offsite properties that usepa has determined are contaminated for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level are quickly evaluated and corrected while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under rcra these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved 

because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor continually evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them 

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals that produce air emissions 

  

which are captured in specialized emission control equipment this filtrant eaf dust is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both cercla and rcra 

nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use and has implemented sitewide recycling programs many of our facilities have incorporated energy efficiency targets to reduce both cost and environmental impacts into their environmental management systems these environmental management systems help facilitate compliance with our environmental commitment which is every nucor teammate’s responsibility nucor’s environmental program maintains a high level of ongoing training commitment outreach and visibility 

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2017 and 2018 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to innovate our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff we have slightly more than 100 employees in our executive office the vast majority of nucor’s approximately 23900 employees as of december 31 2016 are not represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the current global steelmaking capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these 

  

imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows overcapacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china brazil and other countries 

according to the american iron and steel institute global steel overcapacity is estimated at approximately 770 million tons per year with china’s overcapacity being the largest piece at approximately 470 million tons this overcapacity and the slowdown in demand in china have resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially lowpriced steel and steel products to the united states and world steel markets steel and steel products which would otherwise have been consumed by the local steel customers could then be displaced into global markets putting our steel and steel products at a competitive disadvantage a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china 

producers in the world steel market could pursue additional export opportunities as a result of the current abundance of ocean freight capacity furthermore the domestic steel market could experience a contraction in exports at the same time as imports grow due to weakening conditions in europe and policies of foreign governments that result in overvaluing the us dollar against other foreign currencies furthermore the addition of new capacity in the united states could exacerbate the issue of overcapacity domestically as well as globally 

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy metals service centers appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the us economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the united states has recently experienced modest growth in the general economy and steel demand in this country is stronger than in many parts of the world the global and domestic steel industries continue to face significant challenges these challenges are caused by global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties in other regions of the world these situations can contribute to weaker endmarkets and depressed demand for domestically produced steel and steel products potentially resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results 

the economic outlook for our industry remains uncertain both in the united states and globally while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for domestically produced steel and steel products well below the 2007 prerecession levels future economic downturns or a prolonged slowgrowth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

competition from other producers imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business 

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including raw materials cost and availability energy technology labor and capital costs government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum composites plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

  

since 2011 automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further oversupply of steel in north america certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our steelmaking processes dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs the regulation of these ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent ghg regulations are further 

  

implemented because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations we are already impacted in the permit modification and reporting processes both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national air ambient quality standards “naaqs” which are more restrictive than previous standards make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits 

these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have and continue to increase the cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly however because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices the usepa has recently finalized its cpp but that regulation is currently undergoing judicial review these are regulations intended to reduce ghgs from electric generating units the increase in electric costs will vary on a state by state basis but could be substantial across all regions although the rule is stayed pending a final court decision utility companies are making decisions today that will likely increase cost for energy purchasers to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy they could have an impact on nucor’s competitive position 

the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants court challenges regarding many of these regulations have diminished to some extent their impact on various operations further court challenges to some of the naaqs revisions may affect our operations but the impact is likely to be minimal because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment currently there is uncertainty as to the future of these regulations given the change in administration in washington 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates the usepa has recently revised the rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the united states to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag mill scale iron dusts lime and air filtration control dusts to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

  

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes unplanned critical equipment failures acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations threats from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel and therefore affect our results of operations 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2016 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 4 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources 

risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states in europe and in emerging markets there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets these risks include but are not limited to unfavorable political or economic factors local labor and social issues changes in regulatory requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and complex foreign laws treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations 

  

tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the united states nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws potential changes that would adversely affect us include but are not limited to current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates eliminate many tax deductions accelerated depreciation interest expense and the domestic production activity deduction and create border adjustments eliminating deduction of inputs from foreign sources 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations contractual obligations and other legal standards notwithstanding this we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues including regulatory safety environmental employment transportation intellectual property contractual importexport international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings see item 3 “legal proceedings” a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

 item 2 properties tableend we own all of our principal operating facilities these facilities by segment are as follows 

 

 the steel mills segment also includes skyline our steel foundation distributor with us manufacturing facilities in eight states and one facility in canada the majority of which are owned additionally we have a distribution center in veracruz mexico 

in the steel products segment we have approximately 70 operating facilities in addition to the 8 listed above in 37 states and 28 operating facilities in canada our affiliate harris steel inc also operates multiple sales offices in canada and certain other foreign locations 

  

in the raw materials segment djj has 67 operating facilities in 15 states along with multiple brokerage offices in the united states and certain other foreign locations nucor’s raw materials segment also includes our dri facilities in point lisas trinidad and st james parish louisiana a significant portion of the dri production process occurs outdoors the trinidad site including leased land is approximately 184 million square feet the louisiana site has approximately 1742 million square feet of owned land with buildings that total approximately 72000 square feet 

the average utilization rates of all operating facilities in the steel mills steel products and raw materials segments in 2016 were approximately 80 63 and 62 of production capacity respectively during the fourth quarter of 2016 we revised our steel mill capacity estimates to reflect the impact of the shift in our product mix in recent years to include a greater diversity and proportion of valueadded products which often run more slowly on our mills 

we also own our principal executive office in charlotte north carolina

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend since 2008 nucor has been a defendant along with other major steel producers in several related antitrust classaction proceedings filed by standard iron works and other steel purchasers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois the majority of these complaints were filed in september and october of 2008 with two additional complaints being filed in july and december of 2010 two of these complaints were voluntarily dismissed and are no longer pending the plaintiffs alleged that from april 1 2005 through december 31 2007 eight steel manufacturers including nucor engaged in anticompetitive activities with respect to the production and sale of steel nucor denies those allegations the plaintiffs sought monetary and other relief on behalf of themselves and classes of direct and indirect purchasers of steel products from the defendants in the united states between april 1 2005 and december 31 2007 

on september 30 2016 nucor entered into an agreement to settle the claims of the class of direct purchasers of steel products for the amount of 234 million which was paid during the fourth quarter of 2016 nucor believes the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and did not admit liability or the validity of the plaintiffs’ claims as part of the settlement but entered into the settlement in order to avoid the burden expense and distraction of further litigation the settlement was subject to court approval on november 3 2016 the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement direct purchasers of steel products were given notice of the settlement and the opportunity to object to the settlement or to opt out as class members no purchasers timely objected to the settlement and only two purchasers filed notices of intent to opt out on february 16 2017 the court granted final approval of the settlement the settlement does not resolve claims asserted by a separate putative class of indirect purchasers of steel products nucor and other defendants have moved to dismiss those indirect purchaser claims we will continue to vigorously defend against the indirect purchasers’ claims and any other claims relating to these allegations we cannot at this time predict the outcome of the remaining litigation or estimate the range of nucor’s potential exposure if any and consequently have not recorded any reserves or contingencies related to the class of indirect purchasers 

nucor is from time to time a party to various other lawsuits claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business with respect to all such lawsuits claims and proceedings we record reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we do not believe that any of these proceedings individually or in the aggregate would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows nucor maintains liability insurance for certain risks that is subject to certain selfinsurance limits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2016 23 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly the remaining 77 of nucor’s longterm debt was at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2016 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in periods of strong or stable demand for our products we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for our products is weaker this becomes more challenging our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs dri is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic production 

natural gas produced by nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states for the year ended december 31 2016 the volume of natural gas sold from our drilling operations was approximately 28 of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities 

  

nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2016 accumulated other comprehensive income loss included 08 million in unrealized netoftax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2016 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of income taxes or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk —nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and trinidad we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2016 and 2015 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation and its affiliates “nucor” the “company” or “we” manufacture steel and steel products the company also produces direct reduced iron “dri” for use in the company’s steel mills through the david j joseph company and its affiliates “djj” the company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and dri most of the company’s operating facilities and customers are located in north america but nucor does business outside of north america as well the company’s operations include several international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the company and others 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2015 we recycled approximately 169 million tons of scrap steel 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to improve our cost structure enhance our operational flexibility and expand our product portfolios to include more valueadded highermargin offerings our investments total more than 6 billion since the economic downturn began in 2009 with approximately twothirds going to capital expenditures and onethird going to acquisitions the company believes that this focus on lowering cost will enable us to execute on our strategy of delivering profitable growth expanding our product mix and market diversity will make us less susceptible to imports 

a major emphasis of our cost improvement and operational flexibility plan relates to controlling our raw materials cost we have a goal of being able to produce in house between six and seven million tons of annual capacity in highquality scrap substitutes so that we can better control both the cost and reliable sourcing of these raw materials our 2500000 metric tonsperyear dri facility in st james parish louisiana began production in december 2013 between our dri plant in trinidad with an annual capacity of 2000000 metric tons and our new facility in louisiana we are approximately twothirds of the way towards that goal our dri production capability gives us the flexibility to optimize nucor’s overall iron units mix based on current market pricing for scrap and scrap substitutes to provide us with a low cost feedstock for our steel mills 

the dri production process requires significant volumes of natural gas to ensure our dri plant in louisiana has a sustained advantage from lower natural gas costs nucor entered into two longterm onshore natural gas working interest drilling programs in usbased proven reserves with encana oil  gas usa inc “encana” the natural gas produced by these two programs is sold to third parties to offset our exposure to spot prices of natural gas consumed by the louisiana dri facility and our other operations beginning in january 2014 nucor and encana temporarily suspended drilling of new natural gas wells as a result of current low natural gas prices this joint decision demonstrates the flexibility of our partnership with encana to react to shortterm market conditions while preserving our ability to manage nucor’s longterm exposure to higher natural gas prices at our operating divisions that consume natural gas nucor retains its contractual rights to resume drilling in a higher natural gas pricing environment 

of the approximately 4 billion that we have spent since 2009 on capital expenditures the main focus of that spending has been on projects that further our raw materials and valueadded product diversification strategies within the steel mills segment nucor has deployed significant amounts of capital to expand our product offerings enhance productivity and improve costs at our existing operations many of those steel mill capital projects came out of startup during the last few years and are beginning to provide returns to nucor’s stockholders at our hertford county north carolina plate mill several expansions made between 2011 and 2013 have positioned the mill to increase its diversity of product offerings that are less exposed to imports a heat treat line was added at that plate mill to facilitate nucor’s growth in highermargin plate products where 

  

greater strength and abrasion resistance is required the heat treat line allows us to improve the product mix allocation between our two plate mills and five sheet mills to improve margins at those facilities also at the hertford county mill we commissioned a vacuum tank degasser and began operating a normalizing line the final components of nucor’s 290 million project at our south carolina nebraska and tennessee bar mills to expand our special bar quality “sbq” and wire rod production capabilities by approximately one million tons were completed in 2015 our south carolina bar mill is producing wire rod on its new mill and our nebraska mill is now using the fifth strand at its melt shop caster and its upgraded rolling mill our tennessee mill added a second ladle metallurgy furnace a fourth strand at its melt shop caster and a new quality assurance line these sbq projects are an important component of our strategy because they allow us to produce engineered bar for more demanding applications that are less exposed to imports while maintaining our position as a lowcost commodity bar producer by shifting production to our other bar mills in 2014 our berkeley county south carolina mill successfully started up its nearly 100 million capital project that allows us to produce wider and thinner highstrength steel grades that can be used in a wide range of end use markets including metal buildings rail cars water heaters automotive heavy equipment and motor lamination 

nucor’s steel mills segment has also grown significantly in recent years through the acquisitions of gallatin steel company “gallatin” and skyline steel llc “skyline” nucor acquired gallatin in 2014 for a cash purchase price of 779 million located on the ohio river in ghent kentucky gallatin has an annual sheet steel production capacity of approximately 1800000 tons this acquisition is strategically important as it expands nucor’s footprint in the midwestern united states market the acquisition of skyline in 2012 for 675 million was an important strategic investment as it paired skyline’s leadership position in the steel piling distribution market with our nucoryamato steel company “nucoryamato” joint venture’s position as the market leader in steel piling manufacturing to build upon the synergies in the piling market serviced by skyline nucoryamato invested 115 million in a project to broaden its range of hotrolled piling products completed in late 2014 this project added several new sheet piling sections which expanded our product offerings to include wider piling sections that are lighter and stronger covering more area at a lower installed cost we recently announced a 75 million quench and selftempering project at nucoryamato which is expected to be commissioned during the second half of 2016 upon completion the mill will be the sole north american producer of certain highstrength lowalloy structural sections 

segments 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2015 are set forth in note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in nucor’s 2015 annual report which is incorporated by reference the steel mills segment is nucor’s largest segment representing approximately 67 of the company’s sales to external customers in the fiscal year ended december 31 2015 

principal products produced 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces and distributes sheet steel hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks hpiling and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar wire rod and sbq nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills nucor’s equity method investments in duferdofin nucor srl and numit llc are included in the steel mills segment also included in the steel mills segment are our distribution and international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products that nucor and other steel producers have manufactured in the steel products segment nucor produces steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems steel grating and wire and wire mesh in the raw materials segment the company produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri 

  

supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas working interest drilling programs with encana and nucor’s equity method investment in hunter ridge energy services llc 

markets and marketing 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada mexico and elsewhere in the world nucor produces hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized sheet steel in standard grades and to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders we estimate that approximately 60 of our sheet steel sales in 2015 were to contract customers the balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale the proportion of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors including our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons in a manner to meet our customers’ requirements while considering the expected profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in the current marketbased indices andor raw material costs near the time of shipment these sheet sales contracts typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant 

our plate structural reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders in addition our bar mill group manufactures hotrolled sbq products to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors almost all of our plate structural rebar merchant bar and sbq steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices 

in 2015 approximately 86 of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers the balance of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our piling distributor and our downstream joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 

in the steel products segment we sell steel joists and joist girders and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the united states and canada we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longerterm supply contracts may or may not permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs we sell and install fabricated reinforcing products primarily on a construction contract bid basis these products are used by contractors in constructing highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings we manufacture cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders we sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the united states and canada 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces we also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad the markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions 

in the raw materials segment we process ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in our steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers we also broker ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes supply ferroalloys and provide transportation material handling and other services to users of scrap metals our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are electric arc furnace steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to 

  

our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2015 approximately 11 of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons we processed were sold to external customers we used the balance in our steel mills 

also within the raw materials segment are our dri plants in trinidad and louisiana that produce iron inputs exclusively for use in the nucor mills as well as our natural gas working interest drilling programs all natural gas produced by the working interest drilling programs is and will be sold to outside parties 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service 

our electric arc furnace steel mills face many different forms of competition including integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other electric arc steel furnace mills foreign imports and alternative materials large integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a wide variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs electric arc furnace steel mill producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with integrated steel producers 

excess global steelmaking capacity particularly in nonmarket economies continues to be a significant challenge for nucor and the entire us steel industry with the us economy performing better than most other economies around the world the us steel market is the destination of choice for global steel producers finished imports last year captured 29 market share the second consecutive year that figure was at a historically high level while imports were down slightly from 2014 they were still 27 higher than they were in 2013 these imports which are often artificiallypriced make it very difficult for nucor to maintain sales prices and profit levels 

competition from foreign steel and steel product producers presents unique challenges for us imported steel and steel products often benefit from government subsidies either directly or indirectly through governmentowned enterprises or governmentowned or controlled financial institutions china which accounts for almost half of the steel produced annually in the world is the prime example of how some foreign governments impact the global steel market nucor believes that chinese producers many of which are governmentowned in whole or in part benefit from their government’s manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates and from the receipt of government subsidies which allow them to sell their products below cost other foreign governments utilize similar tactics to artificially lower their steel production costs these distorting trade practices are widely recognized as being unfair and have been challenged successfully as violating world trade rules in 2015 the us government made preliminary determinations of injury in three flatrolled steel trade cases involving corrosion resistant coldrolled and hotrolled steel products all three cases are expected to be finalized in 2016 china’s continued treatment as a nonmarket economy in trade disputes in 2016 and beyond is vital for the continued assertive enforcement of world trade rules china was a governmentrun nonmarket economy in 2001 when it entered its protocol of accession to the world trade organization “protocol” and china remains a governmentrun nonmarket economy today the main objective of the protocol was to encourage and in some cases to require china to make marketbased economic reforms however over the past 15 years china has failed to take the required steps to establish that it is a market economy under us law therefore the united states has no reason to change its treatment of china as a nonmarket economy when only one of the relevant provisions of the protocol expires in december 2016 by treating china as a nonmarket economy in antidumping cases the commerce department can assume that chinese prices and costs are distorted and uses other methodologies to calculate antidumping duties this often results in appropriately higher duties against chinese products in order to offset its unfair trade practices 

  

aggressive trade practices left unchallenged seriously undermine the ability of nucor and other domestic producers to compete on price competition from countries with subsidized production costs has significantly contributed to the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the united states when such an exodus occurs the us economy is weakened and nucor’s customer base is diminished rigorous trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign producers that engage in unlawful trade practices nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives become more attractive to our customers 

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 117 billion and 156 billion at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from our downstream businesses nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 135 billion and 149 billion at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the majority of these orders will be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally 

sources and availability of raw materials 

for the past decade nucor has focused on securing access to lowcost raw material inputs as they are the company’s largest expense nucor’s broad balanced supply chain is an important strength which allows us to reduce the cost of our steelmaking operations create a shorter supply chain and have greater optionality over our metallics inputs our investment in dri production facilities and scrap yards as well as our access to international raw materials markets provides nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw materials costs additionally having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials particularly since a good deal of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy including key investments in dri production coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at djj give us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus help us mitigate the risk of significant price fluctuations in input costs 

the primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron dri and hbi on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel as of december 31 2015 djj operated approximately 70 scrap recycling facilities and our annual scrap processing capability exceeded five million tons djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate dri plants in trinidad and louisiana with respective capacities of 2000000 and 2500000 metric tons annually the primary raw material for our dri facilities is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers 

in june 2010 nucor entered into an agreement with encana that involves drilling and completing onshore natural gas wells in the united states nucor entered into a second and more extensive drilling agreement with encana in late 2012 that is projected to span more than 20 years natural gas produced by these working interest drilling programs is sold to offset our exposure to spot prices of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri 

  

facility and our other operations starting in january 2014 nucor and encana temporarily suspended drilling new natural gas wells as a result of current low natural gas prices under its agreements with encana nucor retains its contractual rights to resume drilling in a higher natural gas pricing environment 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills 

djj generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in nucor’s steel mills djj does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the availability and price of ferrous scrap and other metallic inputs such as iron ore are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products 

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges and our natural gas working interest drilling programs 

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefited from relatively stable and competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on an equal footing in the increasingly global marketplace the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today however by many factors including changes in supply and demand advances in drilling technology and increasingly changes in public policy relating to energy production and use because energy is such a significant cost for nucor we strive continually to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace 

environmental laws and regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment the principal federal environmental laws include the clean air act that regulates air emissions the clean water act “cwa” that regulates water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” that governs releases of and remediation of sites contaminated by hazardous substances our operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws 

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations however both federal and state laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent making compliance with them increasingly expensive and burdensome in many instances the total costs of compliance are not readily quantifiable because compliance is so engrained in our operating philosophy that these costs are simply considered part of our standard operating procedures 

the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” recently issued a final rule for the ozone national ambient air quality standard “naaqs” the impact of the new ozone naaqs on nucor is expected to be minimal and will create no adverse impacts usepa also issued a final rule regarding the clean power plan “cpp” while the cpp is directed at electric generating units nucor expects indirect impact through increased electric costs there are ongoing legal challenges to the cpp which will likely delay any potential adverse impacts to us even after resolution of these legal challenges we expect the impacts will be spread over a significant timeframe further mitigating these impacts on nucor’s operations despite this atmosphere of constant regulatory change at this time we do not believe that compliance with these new environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

  

the usepa has recently revised the rules and definitions with respect to recycling and disposal of solid wastes the new rules require states to develop new programs and certification processes that will be forthcoming during the next year we do not expect these rules to have any adverse impact on nucor’s ability to recycle steel or to continue recycling wastes that are routinely handled at our facilities 

nucor uses electric arc furnaces “eaf” to recycle scrap metal into new steel products these eafs use electricity as their primary source of energy as the new greenhouse gas “ghg” regulations air toxics rules and new emissions standards recently imposed on electric utilities are fully implemented it is reasonable to expect that the cost of electricity produced by these utilities will increase see item 1a “risk factors” for more information about the potential impact of ghg regulations on nucor’s business 

the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available 

rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling of and storage of most wastes while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered these activities and offsite properties that usepa has determined are contaminated for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level are quickly evaluated and corrected while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under rcra these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved 

because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor continually evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them 

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment this filtrant eaf dust is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both cercla and rcra 

nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use and has implemented sitewide recycling programs these environmental management systems make environmental commitment each nucor teammate’s responsibility nucor’s environmental program maintains a high level of ongoing training commitment outreach and visibility 

  

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2016 and 2017 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to innovate our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff we have slightly more than 100 employees in our executive office the vast majority of nucor’s approximately 23700 employees are not represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy metals service centers appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the united states has recently experienced modest growth in the general economy and steel demand in this country is stronger than in many parts of the world the global and domestic steel industries continue to face significant challenges these challenges are caused by global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties in other regions of the world these situations can contribute to weaker endmarkets and depressed demand for domestically produced steel and steel products potentially resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results 

the economic outlook for our industry remains uncertain both in the united states and globally while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for domestically produced steel and steel products well below the 2007 prerecession levels future economic downturns or a prolonged slowgrowth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the current global steelmaking capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and 

  

domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows overcapacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china brazil and other countries 

in particular steel production in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel continues to exceed chinese demand according to the china iron  steel association china’s total annual crude steel capacity is 12 billion metric tons while chinese apparent steel demand was only 645 million metric tons in the first 11 months of 2015 this rising overcapacity and slowdown in demand in china has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially lowpriced steel and steel products to the united states and world steel markets steel and steel products which would otherwise have been consumed by the local steel customers could then be displaced into global markets putting our steel and steel products at a competitive disadvantage a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china 

producers in the world steel market could pursue additional export opportunities as a result of the current abundance of ocean freight capacity and lower fuel costs furthermore the domestic steel market could experience a contraction in exports at the same time as imports grow due to weakening conditions in europe and policies of foreign governments that result in overvaluing the us dollar against other foreign currencies furthermore the planned addition of new capacity in the united states could exacerbate the issue of overcapacity domestically as well as globally 

competition from other producers imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business 

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including raw materials cost and availability energy technology labor and capital costs government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum composites plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

since 2011 automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further oversupply of steel in north america certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although we have further vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and 

  

regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our natural gas working interest drilling programs 

the financial performance and condition of our natural gas working interest drilling programs are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices of natural gas and liquids fluctuations in natural gas or liquids prices could have an adverse effect on the company’s natural gas operations and financial condition and the value and recovery of its reserves in the working interest drilling programs prices for natural gas and liquids fluctuate in response to changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company’s control a substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas could result in further delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling programs or curtailment in production at some properties all of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s revenues profitability and cash flows 

our steelmaking processes dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs the regulation of these ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor will be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if ghg regulations are further implemented because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations we have already begun to feel the impact in the permit modification and reporting processes both ghg regulations and recently promulgated naaqs which are more restrictive than previous standards make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits 

these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have and continue to increase the cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic 

  

fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly however because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices the usepa has recently finalized its cpp but there are ongoing legal challenges to that regulation these are regulations intended to reduce ghgs from electric generating units the increase in electric costs will vary on a state by state basis but will be substantial across all regions some states are expected to see increases in excess of 50 for ratepayers there will be many legal challenges to these new regulations but the reality is that utility companies are making decisions today that will increase cost because of uncertainty of the outcome of any legal challenges to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy they will have an impact on nucor’s competitive position 

the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants court challenges regarding many of these regulations have diminished to some extent their impact on various operations nucor operations have not however experienced any relief from these legal actions further court challenges to some of the naaqs revisions may affect our operations but the impact is likely to be minimal because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates the usepa has recently revised the rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the united states to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag mill scale iron dusts lime and air filtration control dusts to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes unplanned critical equipment failures acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

  

we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations threats from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel and therefore affect our results of operations 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2015 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 4 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources 

risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states in europe and in emerging markets there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets these risks include but are not limited to unfavorable political or economic factors local labor and social issues changes in regulatory requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and complex foreign laws treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations 

tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the united states nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax 

  

laws potential changes that would adversely affect us include but are not limited to current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates and eliminate most tax deductions repealing lifo lastin firstout treatment of inventory accelerated depreciation and the domestic production activity deduction and decrease the ability of us companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the us deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations contractual obligations and other legal standards notwithstanding this we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues including regulatory safety environmental employment transportation intellectual property contractual importexport international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings see item 3 “legal proceedings” a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend nucor has been named along with other major steel producers as a codefendant in several related antitrust classaction complaints filed by standard iron works and other steel purchasers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois the majority of these complaints were filed in september and october of 2008 with two additional complaints being filed in july and december of 2010 two of these complaints have been voluntarily dismissed and are no longer pending the plaintiffs allege that from april 1 2005 through december 31 2007 eight steel manufacturers including nucor engaged in anticompetitive activities with respect to the production and sale of steel the plaintiffs seek monetary and other relief on behalf of themselves and a putative class of all purchasers of steel products from the defendants in the us between april 1 2005 and december 31 2007 five of the eight defendants have reached court approved settlements with the plaintiffs on september 9 2015 the district court entered an order ruling on issues of class certification the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ motion certifying a class solely on the issue of whether defendants engaged in a conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws and declining to certify a class on the issues of antitrust impact and damages we continue to believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them but we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or estimate the range of nucor’s potential exposure and consequently have not recorded any reserves or contingencies related to this lawsuit 

on march 25 2014 a jury in the us district court for the southern district of texas returned a verdict against nucor and its codefendants in an antitrust lawsuit brought by plaintiff mm steel lp a steel plate service center located in houston the jury returned a verdict of 520 million in damages against all defendants jointly and severally on june 1 2014 pursuant to antitrust laws providing for treble damages the court awarded a judgment to mm steel jointly and severally against the defendants in an amount totaling 1608 million after including costs and attorneys’ fees as a result of postverdict developments including settlements reached by various other parties the company’s practical estimable exposure was reduced to approximately 400 million the company appealed the judgment to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit and on november 25 2015 the fifth circuit reversed the verdict against nucor finding that there was not sufficient evidence to support liability against the company thereby reducing our current practical estimable exposure to zero 

nucor is from time to time a party to various lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business with respect to all such lawsuits claims and proceedings we record reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we do not believe that any of these proceedings individually or in the aggregate would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows nucor maintains liability insurance for certain risks that is subject to certain selfinsurance limits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them 

  

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2015 23 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly the remaining 77 of nucor’s longterm debt was at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2015 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in periods of strong or stable demand for our products we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for our products is weaker this becomes more challenging 

natural gas produced by nucor’s working interest drilling programs is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility in addition to the natural gas needs at the louisiana dri facility nucor is also a substantial consumer of natural gas at our steel mill operations dependent on future natural gas pricing natural gas produced through the working interest drilling programs is expected to be sufficient to cover nucor’s current demand at all of its steel mills in the united states plus the demand of two dri plants or alternatively at three dri plants however the natural gas production from the working interest drilling programs currently does not completely cover the natural gas usage at our operating facilities due to the temporary suspension of drilling discussed below for the year ended december 31 2015 the volume of natural gas sold from our working interest drilling programs was approximately 54 of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities 

our natural gas working interest drilling programs are affected by changes in natural gas prices in an inverse manner to natural gas costs at our dri and steel mill operations as natural gas prices increase our increased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations is somewhat mitigated by increased profit from sales of natural gas to third party customers from our working interest drilling programs likewise as natural gas prices decrease we experience decreased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations but we also experience decreased profit from our working interest drilling programs the impact of low natural gas prices associated with our working interest drilling programs is limited by the existence of a drilling suspension clause nucor is contractually obligated to drill a minimum number of wells per year under the terms of our original agreements with encana however we have the right to suspend drilling of new wells if market pricing falls below a preestablished threshold in the fourth quarter of 2013 nucor and encana agreed to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells until there is a sustained improvement in natural gas pricing 

  

nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2015 accumulated other comprehensive income loss included 117 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2015 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of tax or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk— nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and trinidad we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2015 and 2014 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation and its affiliates “nucor” the “company” or “we” manufacture steel and steel products the company also produces direct reduced iron “dri” for use in the company’s steel mills through the david j joseph company and its affiliates “djj” the company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and dri most of the company’s operating facilities and customers are located in north america but nucor is doing business outside of north america as well the company’s operations include several international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the company and others 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2014 we recycled approximately 190 million tons of scrap steel 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to improve our cost structure and expand our product portfolios to include more valueadded higher margined offerings our investments total nearly 6 billion during the last six years with approximately twothirds going to capital expenditures and onethird going to acquisitions the company believes that this focus on lowering cost will enable us to execute on our strategy of delivering profitable growth and expanding our product mix and market diversity will make us less susceptible to imports 

a major emphasis of our cost improvement plan is on reducing our raw materials cost we have a goal of controlling between six and seven million tons of annual capacity in highquality scrap substitutes so that we can better control both the cost and reliable sourcing of these raw materials our 2500000 metric tonsperyear dri facility in st james parish louisiana began production in december 2013 between the dri plant in trinidad with an annual capacity of 2000000 metric tons and our new facility in louisiana we will be approximately twothirds of the way towards that goal when the louisiana facility is fully operational our dri plant in st james parish louisiana produced excellent quality dri through the first ten months of 2014 however the plant experienced operational challenges in 2014 as it went through several outages to make changes intended to improve consistency in the production process and yield performance in november the plant’s process gas heater experienced a failure leading to the immediate suspension of production operations due to the lead times on the specialty steel pipes that must be replaced we estimate that the louisiana dri plant will be operational again late in the first quarter of 2015 

the dri production process requires significant volumes of natural gas to ensure the dri plant in louisiana has a sustained advantage from lower natural gas costs nucor entered into two longterm onshore natural gas working interest drilling programs in usbased proven reserves with encana oil  gas usa inc “encana” that allow us to better manage our exposure to natural gas pricing volatility and our overall energy demand for our operations the natural gas produced by these two programs is sold to third parties to offset our exposure to the volatility of the price of natural gas consumed by the louisiana dri facility and our other operations in december 2013 nucor made a joint decision with encana to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells the joint decision was made due to the thencurrent expectation that the natural gas pricing environment would be weak in 2014 in the fourth quarter of 2014 nucor and encana agreed to further suspend drilling through calendar year 2015 except for a de minimis number of wells that are necessary in order to retain leasehold rights we believe this joint decision demonstrates the flexibility of our partnership with encana to react to market conditions to the mutual benefit of both parties while still allowing us to better manage our exposure to natural gas pricing volatility at our operating divisions that consume natural gas 

of the approximately 4 billion that has been spent since 2009 on capital expenditures the main focus of that spending has been on projects that further our raw materials and valueadded product diversification 

  

strategies within the steel mills segment nucor has deployed significant amounts of capital to expand our product offerings enhance productivity and improve costs at our existing operations at our hertford county north carolina plate mill the heat treat line became operational in 2011 which has allowed nucor to grow its presence in highermargin products where greater strength and abrasion resistance is required the heat treat line allows us to improve the product mix allocation between our two plate mills and five sheet mills to improve margins at those facilities also at the hertford county mill we commissioned a vacuum tank degasser in 2012 and we began operating a normalizing line in 2013 collectively these investments have positioned the hertford county mill to increase the diversity of our product offerings that are less exposed to imports nucor’s 290 million project at our tennessee nebraska and south carolina bar mills to expand our special bar quality “sbq” and wire rod production capabilities by approximately one million tons is nearing completion production has begun on the new wire rod mill located in south carolina and our nebraska mill successfully started up the fifth strand at its melt shop caster and its upgraded rolling mill our tennessee mill added a second ladle metallurgy furnace a fourth strand at its melt shop caster and a new quality assurance line the sbq projects which we expect to be completed in 2015 will allow us to produce engineered bar for more demanding applications that are less exposed to imports while maintaining our position as a lowcost commodity bar producer by shifting production to our other bar mills in 2014 our berkeley county south carolina mill successfully started up its nearly 100 million capital project that allows us to produce wider and thinner highstrength steel grades that can be used in lightweight automotive applications 

nucor’s steel mills segment has also grown significantly in recent years through the acquisitions of gallatin steel company “gallatin” and skyline steel llc “skyline” nucor acquired gallatin in 2014 for a cash purchase price of 779 million located on the ohio river in ghent kentucky gallatin has an annual sheet steel production capacity of approximately 1800000 tons this acquisition is strategically important as it expands nucor’s footprint in the midwestern united states market and it broadens nucor’s product offerings in the pipe and tube market the acquisition of skyline in 2012 for 675 million was an important strategic investment as it paired skyline’s leadership position in the steel piling distribution market with our nucoryamato steel company “nucoryamato” joint venture’s position as the market leader in steel piling manufacturing to build upon the synergies in the piling market serviced by skyline nucoryamato has invested 115 million in a project to broaden its range of hotrolled piling products completed in the second half of 2014 this project added several new sheet piling sections which expanded our product offerings to include wider piling sections that are lighter and stronger covering more area at a lower installed cost 

segments 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2014 are set forth in note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in nucor’s 2014 annual report which is incorporated by reference the steel mills are nucor’s largest segment representing approximately 70 of the company’s sales to external customers in the fiscal year ended december 31 2014 

principal products produced 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces and distributes sheet steel hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks hpiling and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar wire rod and sbq nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills nucor’s equity method investments in duferdofin nucor srl and numit llc are included in the steel mills segment also included in the steel mills segment are our distribution and international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products that nucor and other steel producers have manufactured in the steel products segment nucor produces steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel 

  

cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh in the raw materials segment the company produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas working interest drilling programs with encana and nucor’s equity method investment in hunter ridge energy services llc 

markets and marketing 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada mexico and elsewhere in the world nucor produces hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized sheet steel in standard grades and to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders we estimate that approximately 50 of our sheet steel sales in 2014 were to contract customers the balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale the proportion of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors including our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons to maximize profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in the current marketbased indices andor raw material costs near the time of shipment these sheet sales contracts typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant 

our plate structural reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders in addition our bar mill group manufactures hotrolled sbq products to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors almost all of our plate structural rebar merchant bar and sbq steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices 

in 2014 approximately 85 of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers the balance of the steel mills segment’s shipments went to our piling distributor and our downstream joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 

in the steel products segment we sell steel joists and joist girders and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the united states and canada we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longerterm supply contracts may or may not permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs we sell and install fabricated reinforcing products only on a construction contract bid basis these products are used by contractors in constructing highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings we manufacture cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders we sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the united states and canada 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces we also utilize our internal distribution and trading companies to market our products abroad the markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions 

in the raw materials segment we process ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in our steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers we also broker ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes supply ferroalloys and provide transportation material handling and other services to users of scrap metals our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are electric arc furnace steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other 

  

processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2014 approximately 14 of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons we processed were sold to external customers we used the balance in our steel mills 

also within the raw materials segment are our dri plants in trinidad and louisiana that produce iron inputs exclusively for use in the nucor mills as well as our natural gas working interest drilling programs all natural gas produced by the working interest drilling programs is and will be sold to outside parties and as a result the revenues from these sales are a small but increasing amount of our revenues 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 156 billion and 177 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from our downstream businesses nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 149 billion and 127 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the majority of these orders will be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally 

sources and availability of raw materials 

the primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron dri and hbi on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel as of december 31 2014 djj operated over 70 scrap recycling facilities and our annual scrap processing capability exceeded five million tons djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate dri plants in trinidad and louisiana with respective capacities of 2000000 and 2500000 metric tons annually the primary raw material for our dri facilities is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers our newly constructed louisiana dri facility is the first phase of a multiphase site development plan opportunity in louisiana 

in 2010 nucor entered into an agreement with encana that involves drilling and completing onshore natural gas wells in usbased proven reserves over an approximate sevenyear period that began in june 2010 nucor entered into a second and more extensive drilling agreement with encana in late 2012 that is projected to span more than 20 years natural gas produced by these working interest drilling programs is being sold to offset our exposure to the volatility of the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our other operations in december 2013 nucor and encana announced an agreement to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells due to the thencurrent expectations that the natural gas pricing environment would be weak in 2014 in the fourth quarter of 2014 nucor and encana agreed to extend our drilling suspension through the end of 2015 the 2015 capital expenditures for drilling will consist of drilling a de minimis number of wells required to maintain leasehold rights under the agreement with encana nucor maintains the right to resume drilling at any point should natural gas prices change in addition to our natural gas needs at the louisiana dri facility nucor is also a substantial consumer of natural gas at our steel mill operations the drilling of natural gas wells under the two agreements is expected to be sufficient in the future to cover nucor’s demand at all of its steel mills in the united states plus the demand of two dri plants or alternatively at three dri plants if additional capacity were to be added 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills 

djj generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in nucor’s steel mills djj does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the 

  

availability and price of ferrous scrap are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes are our single largest cost of products sold a key part of our business strategy is to control a significant portion of the supply of high quality metallics needed to operate our steel mills 

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana are also large consumers of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges and our natural gas working interest drilling programs 

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefited from relatively stable and competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on an equal footing in the increasingly global marketplace the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today however by many factors including changes in supply and demand advances in drilling technology and increasingly changes in public policy relating to energy production and use because energy is such a significant cost of products sold for nucor we strive continually to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service 

our electric arc furnace steel mills face many different forms of competition including integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other electric arc furnace mills foreign imports and alternative materials large integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a wide variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs electric arc furnace mill producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with integrated steel producers 

overproduction in global steelmaking capacity continues to be a significant challenge for nucor and the entire us steel industry with the us economy performing better than most other economies around the world the us steel market is the destination of choice for global steel producers in 2014 total steel imports increased 38 compared with 2013 and imports of finished and semifinished steel products accounted for 34 of us market share last year imports increased from nearly every steelproducing country and in virtually every category of steel products these imports which are sometimes artificiallypriced make it very difficult for nucor to maintain sales prices and profit levels 

competition from foreign steel and steel product producers presents unique challenges for us imported steel and steel products often benefit from government subsidies either directly or indirectly through governmentowned enterprises or governmentowned or controlled financial institutions china which accounts for almost half of the steel produced annually in the world is the prime example of how foreign governments impact the global steel market nucor believes that chinese producers many of which are governmentowned in whole or in part benefit from their government’s manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates and from the receipt of government subsidies which allow them to sell their products below cost other foreign governments utilize similar tactics to artificially lower their steel production costs these distorting trade practices are widely 

  

recognized as being unfair and have been challenged successfully as violating world trade rules the us government recently completed several successful trade enforcement actions including terminating its suspension agreement with russia for hotrolled steel imports assessing duties on oil country tubular goods from south korea and five other countries and ruling that the domestic rebar industry has been materially injured as a result of dumped and subsidized rebar imports from turkey and mexico 

aggressive trade practices left unchallenged seriously undermine the ability of nucor and other domestic producers to compete on price competition from countries with subsidized production costs has significantly contributed to the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the united states when such an exodus occurs the us economy is weakened and nucor’s customer base is diminished rigorous trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign producers that engage in unlawful trade practices nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives become more attractive to our customers 

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal 

environmental laws and regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment the principal federal environmental laws include the clean air act “caa” that regulates air emissions the clean water act “cwa” that regulates water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” that governs releases of and remediation of sites contaminated by hazardous substances our operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws 

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations however both federal and state laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent making compliance with them increasingly expensive and burdensome in many instances the total costs of compliance are not readily quantifiable because compliance is so engrained in our operating philosophy that these costs are simply considered part of our standard operating procedures 

the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” has proposed or promulgated many new national ambient air quality standards and toxic air emissions rules for which it has recently or not yet issued guidance or compliance deadlines while we begin immediately to plan for compliance with such standards and rules we cannot fully assess their impact on our operations until the guidance has been fully developed or issued and compliance deadlines have been established in other cases where environmental regulations are proposed or promulgated that may regulate previously unregulated aspects of our operations it is impossible for us to fully determine the impact of these regulations until protracted legal challenges have been concluded and usepa or other regulatory agencies have developed and issued technical guidance despite this atmosphere of regulatory uncertainty at this time we do not believe that compliance with these new environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program administered by the states with civil and criminal enforcement sanctions each of our steel mills is required to operate in compliance with its permit or potentially incur sanctions for failing to do so because of the size of our steelmaking operations they are subject to new “greenhouse gasses” “ghgs” regulations and are required to 

  

do ghg best available control technology “bact” evaluations when their permits are modified there is still uncertainty and very little guidance from usepa as to what is or may be considered ghg bact for steelmaking operations our operations are currently properly permitted and we will not need to make these determinations unless and until these permits are modified based on current guidance we do not expect these requirements to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

nucor uses electric arc furnaces “eaf” to recycle scrap metal into new steel products these eafs use electricity as their primary source of energy as the new ghg regulations air toxics rules and new emissions standards recently imposed on electric utilities are fully implemented it is reasonable to expect that the cost of electricity produced by these utilities will increase see item 1a “risk factors” for more information about the potential impact of ghg regulations on nucor’s business 

the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available 

rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling of and storage of most wastes while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered these and offsite properties that usepa has determined are contaminated for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level are quickly evaluated and corrected while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under rcra these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved 

because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor continually evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them 

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment this filtrant eaf dust is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both cercla and rcra 

nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use and has implemented sitewide recycling programs these environmental management systems make environmental commitment each nucor teammate’s responsibility nucor’s environmental program maintains a high level of training commitment outreach and visibility 

  

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2015 and 2016 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to innovate our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff we have slightly more than 100 employees in our executive office the vast majority of nucor’s 23600 employees are not represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy metals service centers appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows five years removed from the worst recession the united states has experienced in decades we have begun to see some improvement in general economic and manufacturing activity however the slow pace of recovery coupled with ongoing uncertainties in europe and other regions of the world continue to weigh on global and domestic growth these situations continue to contribute to weaker endmarkets and depressed demand resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results 

although we experienced increased profitability in 2014 from the previous year the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products compared to prerecession levels future economic downturns or a prolonged slowgrowth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and 

  

domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows overcapacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china brazil and other countries 

in particular steel production in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel continues to exceed chinese demand this rising overcapacity in china has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially lowpriced steel and steel products to the united states and world steel markets steel and steel products which would otherwise have been consumed by the local steel customers could then be displaced into global markets putting our steel and steel products at a competitive disadvantage a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china 

producers in the world steel market could pursue additional export opportunities as a result of the current abundance of ocean freight capacity and lower fuel costs however the domestic steel market could experience a contraction in exports at the same time as imports grow due to weakening conditions in europe and policies of foreign governments that result in overvaluing the us dollar against other foreign currencies furthermore the planned addition of new capacity in the united states could exacerbate the issue of overcapacity domestically as well as globally 

competition from other producers imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business 

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including raw materials cost and availability energy technology labor and capital costs government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum composites plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

since 2011 automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further oversupply of steel in north america certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some 2015 and 2016 models 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although we have further vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of our global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our 

  

markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our natural gas working interest drilling programs 

the financial performance and condition of our natural gas working interest drilling programs are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices of natural gas and liquids fluctuations in natural gas or liquids prices could have an adverse effect on the company’s natural gas operations and financial condition and the value and recovery of its reserves in the working interest drilling programs prices for natural gas and liquids fluctuate in response to changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company’s control a substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas could result in further delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling programs or curtailment in production at some properties all of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s revenues profitability and cash flows 

our steelmaking processes dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs the regulation of these ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor will be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if ghg regulations are further implemented because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations we have already begun to feel the impact in the permit modification and reporting processes both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” which are more restrictive than previous standards make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits 

these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have and continue to increase the cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal 

  

thereby reducing their emissions significantly however because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy they will have an impact on nucor’s ability to compete 

the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants court challenges regarding many of these regulations have diminished to some extent their impact on various operations nucor operations have not however experienced any relief from these legal actions further court challenges to some of the naaqs revisions may affect our operations but the impact is likely to be minimal because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

various legislative efforts at all levels are in process that are intended to further regulate the hydraulic fracturing process used by the oil and gas industry hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of natural gas wells in shale and tight sand formations including all of those in our natural gas working interest drilling programs this process involves the injection of water chemicals and at times sand under pressure into rock formations to stimulate the release of natural gas oil and natural gas liquids sponsors of these proposals and regulations have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies andor that hydraulic fracturing could pose a variety of other risks the practitioners of fracking are adamant that these claims are false and to date the usepa has not attempted to further regulate the practice any onerous governmental regulations could lead to operational delays increased operating costs that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and possibly even the cessation of drilling 

we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

  

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes unplanned critical equipment failures acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations threats from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches while decentralization tends to compartmentalize exposure these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2014 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 361 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources 

risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

certain of our businesses are located outside of the united states in europe and in emerging markets there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets these include but are not limited to unfavorable political or economic factors local labor and social issues changes in regulatory requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and complex foreign laws treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations 

  

tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the us nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws potential changes that would adversely affect us include but are not limited to current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates and eliminate most tax deductions repealing lifo lastin firstout treatment of inventory accelerated depreciation and the domestic production activity deduction and decrease the ability of us companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the us deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations contractual obligations and other legal standards notwithstanding this we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues including regulatory safety environmental employment transportation intellectual property contractual importexport international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings see item 3 “legal proceedings” a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend nucor has been named along with other major steel producers as a codefendant in several related antitrust classaction complaints filed by standard iron works and other steel purchasers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois the majority of these complaints were filed in september and october of 2008 with two additional complaints being filed in july and december of 2010 two of these complaints have been voluntarily dismissed and are no longer pending the plaintiffs allege that from april 1 2005 through december 31 2007 eight steel manufacturers including nucor engaged in anticompetitive activities with respect to the production and sale of steel the plaintiffs seek monetary and other relief five of the eight defendants have reached court approved settlements with the plaintiffs although we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or estimate the range of nucor’s potential exposure nucor has not recorded any reserves or contingencies related to this legal matter 

on april 19 2012 mm steel lp filed an action against nucor and its codefendants in the us district court for the southern district of texas and has asserted violations of federal antitrust law on march 25 2014 the jury returned a verdict of 520 million in damages against all defendants jointly and severally which amount was subject to trebling under the federal antitrust laws on june 1 2014 the court awarded a judgment jointly and severally against the defendants totaling 1608 million after trebling and including costs and attorneys’ fees although the company has filed an appeal with the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit and believes that it has valid grounds to have the judgment vacated or reversed the ultimate resolution of the case is uncertain nucor has not recorded any reserves or contingencies related to this legal matter 

nucor is from time to time a party to various lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business with respect to all such lawsuits claims and proceedings we record reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we do not believe that any of these proceedings individually or in the aggregate would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows nucor maintains liability insurance for certain risks that is subject to certain selfinsurance limits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2014 23 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly the remaining 77 of nucor’s longterm debt was at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2014 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in periods of strong or stable demand for our products we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for our products is weaker this becomes more challenging 

natural gas produced by nucor’s working interest drilling programs is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility in addition to the future natural gas needs at the louisiana dri facility that began operations in the fourth quarter of 2013 nucor is also a substantial consumer of natural gas at our steel mill operations natural gas produced through the working interest drilling programs is expected to be sufficient in the future to cover nucor’s demand at all of its steel mills in the united states plus the demand of two dri plants or alternatively at three dri plants however 

  

the natural gas production from the working interest drilling programs currently does not completely cover the natural gas usage at our operating facilities due to the temporary cessation of drilling discussed below for the year ended december 31 2014 the volume of natural gas sold from our natural gas working interest drilling programs was approximately 66 of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities 

our natural gas working interest drilling programs are affected by changes in natural gas prices in an inverse manner to natural gas costs at our dri and steel mill operations as natural gas prices increase our increased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations is somewhat mitigated by increased profit from sales of natural gas to third party customers from our natural gas drilling programs likewise as natural gas prices decrease we experience decreased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations but we also experience decreased profit from our natural gas drilling programs 

the impact of low natural gas prices associated with our drilling programs is limited by the existence of a drilling suspension clause nucor is contractually obligated to drill a minimum number of wells per year under the terms of our original agreements with encana however we have the right to suspend drilling of new wells if market pricing falls below a preestablished threshold in the fourth quarter of 2013 we announced a joint decision with encana to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells until there is a sustained improvement in natural gas pricing in the fourth quarter of 2014 nucor and encana agreed to further suspend drilling through calendar year 2015 except for a de minimis number of wells that are necessary in order to retain leasehold rights we believe that this pause demonstrates the flexibility of our partnership with encana to react to market conditions to the mutual benefit of both parties while still allowing us to better manage our exposure to natural gas pricing volatility at our operating divisions that consume natural gas 

nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2014 accumulated other comprehensive income loss included 80 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2014 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of tax or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk —nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe and trinidad we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2014 and 2013 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation and its affiliates “nucor” or the “company” manufacture steel and steel products the company also produces direct reduced iron “dri” for use in the company’s steel mills through the david j joseph company and its affiliates “djj” which the company acquired in 2008 the company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and dri most of the company’s operating facilities and customers are located in north america but increasingly nucor is doing business outside of north america as well the company’s operations include several international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the company and others 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2013 we recycled approximately 192 million tons of scrap steel 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has employed a multipronged growth strategy in recent years that allows for the ability to capitalize on a variety of growth opportunities as they arise the five prongs of that growth strategy are 1 optimizing and continually improving our existing operations 2 executing on our raw materials strategy 3 growing through developing greenfield projects that capitalize on new technologies and unique marketplace opportunities 4 acquiring other companies that will strengthen nucor’s position as north america’s most diversified producer of steel and steel products and 5 growing internationally with an emphasis on leveraging strategic partnerships and new technologies 

in order to optimize our existing operations we commit a significant portion of our capital expenditures each year to projects that enhance productivity and improve costs as well as allow us to produce more valueadded and typically highermargin products at our existing facilities the heat treat line at our hertford county north carolina mill became operational in 2010 which has allowed nucor to grow its presence in highermargin products where greater strength and abrasion resistance is required the heat treat line allows us to improve the product mix allocation between our two plate mills and four sheet mills to improve margins at those facilities also at the hertford county mill we commissioned a vacuum tank degasser in 2012 and we began operating a normalizing line in 2013 during 2012 nucor began work on a 290 million strategic investment to expand our special bar quality “sbq” and wire rod production capabilities at our tennessee nebraska and south carolina bar mills by approximately one million tons the following achievements illustrate the significant progress that was made on these projects during 2013 production began on the new wire rod mill located in south carolina our nebraska mill successfully started up its upgraded rolling mill and our tennessee mill completed the installation and commissioning of a new quality assurance line the sbq projects which we expect to be completed over the course of 2014 and 2015 will allow us to produce engineered bar for the most demanding applications while maintaining our market share in commodity bar products by shifting production to our other bar mills other planned valueadded projects at existing operations include the vacuum tank degasser that began operating at our hickman arkansas mill in late 2012 and the modernization of casting hot rolling and downstream operations that will allow us to produce wider and lighter gauge hotrolled and coldrolled steel products at our berkeley south carolina mill beginning in early 2014 

as part of the execution of our raw materials strategy we have a goal of controlling between six and seven million tons of annual capacity in highquality scrap substitutes our 2500000 metric tonsperyear dri facility in st james parish louisiana began production in december 2013 between our existing dri plant in trinidad which we expanded in recent years to increase the annual capacity from 1800000 to 2000000 metric tons and our new facility in louisiana we will be approximately twothirds of the way towards that goal 

  

the drimaking process requires significant volumes of natural gas to ensure the new dri plant in louisiana has a sustained advantage from lower natural gas costs nucor entered into two longterm onshore natural gas working interest drilling programs in usbased proven reserves with encana oil  gas usa inc “encana” that allow us to better manage our exposure to natural gas pricing volatility and our overall energy demand for our operations the natural gas produced by these two programs will be sold to offset our exposure to the volatility of the price of natural gas consumed by the louisiana dri facility and our other operations in december 2013 nucor announced that we and encana made a joint decision to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells the joint decision was made due to the current weak natural gas pricing environment this joint decision demonstrates the flexibility of our partnership with encana to react to market conditions to the mutual benefit of both parties while still allowing us to better manage our exposure to natural gas pricing volatility at our operating divisions that consume natural gas 

growth through greenfield projects has included the construction of our sbq steel mill in memphis tennessee which we completed in 2009 we also began commercial production in 2009 at a new facility in blytheville arkansas which uses breakthrough castrip ® technology to strip cast molten steel into near final shape and thickness with minimal hot or cold rolling this allows for lower investment and operating costs and reduces the environmental impact of producing steel 

although the pace at which we have been acquiring other companies has slowed in the past few years the acquisition of skyline steel llc “skyline” in 2012 was a notable exception the skyline acquisition is an important strategic investment as it pairs skyline’s leadership position in the steel piling distribution market with our nucoryamato steel company “nucoryamato” joint venture’s position as the market leader in steel piling manufacturing to build upon the synergies in the piling market serviced by skyline nucor announced that nucoryamato will be expanding to broaden its range of hotrolled piling products upon completion in mid2014 this project will add several new sheet piling sections increasing the single sheet widths by 22 and providing a lighter stronger sheet covering more area at a lower installed cost 

in 2010 we entered into an agreement with mitsui  co usa to form numit llc “numit” in which we own a 50 economic and voting interest numit owns 100 of the equity interest in steel technologies llc “steel technologies” which operates 24 sheet processing facilities located throughout the united states canada and mexico since our investment in numit began steel technologies constructed a flatrolled steel processing operation in celaya mexico that became operational in late 2012 the 125000squarefoot facility is equipped with two slitting lines additionally steel technologies’ new flatrolled steel processing facility in the bajio region of mexico became fully operational in november 2013 these new investments will allow us to capitalize on the rapid growth in the mexican automotive industry 

segments 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2013 are set forth in note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in nucor’s 2013 annual report which is hereby incorporated by reference the steel mills are nucor’s largest segment representing approximately 70 of the company’s sales to external customers in the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 

principal products produced 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces and distributes sheet steel hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks hpiling and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar and sbq nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills 

  

nucor’s equity method investments in duferdofin nucor srl and numit are included in the steel mills segment also included in the steel mills segment are our international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products that nucor and other steel producers have manufactured in the steel products segment nucor produces steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh in the raw materials segment the company produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas working interest drilling programs with encana and nucor’s equity method investment in hunter ridge energy services llc 

markets and marketing 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada mexico and increasingly elsewhere in the world nucor produces hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized sheet steel in standard grades and to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders we estimate that approximately 65 of our sheet steel sales in 2013 were to contract customers the balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale the proportion of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors including our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons to maximize profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and market conditions these sheet sales contracts typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant 

our plate structural reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders in addition our bar mill group manufactures hotrolled sbq products to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors almost all of our plate structural and bar steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices 

in 2013 approximately 86 of the shipments made by our steel mills segment were to external customers the balance of the steel mill segment’s shipments went to our piling distributor and our downstream joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 

in the steel products segment we sell steel joists and joist girders and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the united states and canada we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longerterm supply contracts may permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs we sell fabricated reinforcing products only on a construction contract bid basis these products are used by contractors in constructing highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings we manufacture cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders we sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the united states and canada 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces we also utilize our internal trading companies to market our products abroad the markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions 

in the raw materials segment we process ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in our steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers we also broker ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes supply ferroalloys and provide transportation material handling and other services to 

  

users of scrap metals our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are electric arc furnace steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2013 approximately 13 of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons we processed were sold to external customers we used the balance in our steel mills 

also within the raw materials segment are our dri plants in trinidad and louisiana that produce iron inputs exclusively for use in the nucor mills as well as our working interest drilling programs all natural gas produced by the working interest drilling programs is and will be sold to outside parties and as a result the revenues from these sales are a small but increasing amount of our revenues 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 177 billion and 146 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively order backlog for the steel mills segment includes only orders from external customers and excludes orders from our downstream businesses nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 127 billion and 117 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the majority of these orders will be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally 

sources and availability of raw materials 

the primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron dri and hbi on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel as of december 31 2013 djj operated over 70 scrap recycling facilities and our annual scrap processing capability exceeded five million tons djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate dri plants in trinidad and louisiana with respective capacities of 2000000 and 2500000 metric tons annually the primary raw material for our dri facilities is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers our newly constructed louisiana dri facility is the first phase of a multiphase plan that is expected to include additional operations in louisiana 

in 2010 nucor entered into an agreement with encana that involves drilling and completing onshore natural gas wells in usbased proven reserves over an approximate sevenyear period that began in june 2010 nucor entered into a second and more extensive drilling agreement with encana in late 2012 that is projected to span more than 20 years natural gas produced by these working interest drilling programs is being sold to offset our exposure to the volatility of the price of gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility in the fourth quarter of 2013 nucor and encana announced an agreement to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells given current expectations that the natural gas pricing environment will be weak in 2014 by the middle of 2014 all inprocess wells will be completed at that point there will be over 300 producing wells providing enough natural gas to cover our louisiana dri plant’s expected consumption into 2015 in addition to our natural gas needs at the new dri facility nucor is also a substantial consumer of natural gas at our steel mill operations once drilling resumes the drilling of natural gas wells under the two agreements is expected to be sufficient to cover nucor’s demand at all of its steel mills in the united states plus the demand of two dri plants or alternatively at three dri plants 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills 

djj generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in nucor’s steel mills djj does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the 

  

availability and price of ferrous scrap are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes are our single largest cost of products sold a key part of our business strategy is to control a significant portion of the supply of high quality metallics needed to operate our steel mills 

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana are large consumers of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges and our natural gas working interest drilling programs 

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefitted from relatively stable and competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on an equal footing in the increasingly global marketplace the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today however by many factors including changes in supply and demand advances in drilling technology and increasingly changes in public policy relating to energy production and use because energy is such a significant cost of products sold for nucor we strive continually to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service 

our electric arc furnace steel mills face many different forms of competition including integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other electric arc furnace mills foreign imports and alternative materials large integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a wide variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs electric arc furnace mill producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with integrated steel producers 

over the last few years nucor has experienced increased competition stemming from significant excess capacity both domestic and foreign although there were no noteworthy additions to domestic capacity in 2013 oversupply is still a significant issue while steel imports decreased slightly from 2012 the overall level of finished and semifinished steel imports is still extremely high at 30 of the us steel market these artificiallypriced imports make it very difficult for nucor to maintain sales prices and profit levels 

competition from foreign steel and steel product producers presents unique challenges for us imported steel and steel products often benefit from government subsidies either directly or indirectly through governmentowned enterprises or governmentowned or controlled financial institutions in particular competition from steel imported from china which accounts for more than 45 of the steel produced annually in the world is a major challenge we believe that chinese producers many of whom are governmentowned in whole or in part benefit from their government’s manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates and from the receipt of government subsidies which allow them to sell their products below cost these distorting trade practices are widely recognized as being unfair and have been challenged successfully as violating world trade rules examples of successful challenges include the imposition of antidumping duty orders on imports of line pipe oil country tubular goods rebar cuttolength plate and hotrolled sheet from china 

  

china’s aggressive trade practices left unchallenged seriously undermine the ability of nucor and other domestic producers to compete on price china’s artificially lowered production costs have significantly contributed to the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the united states when such an exodus occurs the us economy is weakened and nucor’s customer base is diminished rigorous trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign producers that engage in unlawful trade practices nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements and address the jobs crisis in the united states 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives become more attractive to our customers 

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal 

environmental laws and regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment the principal federal environmental laws include the clean air act “caa” that regulates air emissions the clean water act “cwa” that regulates water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” that governs releases of and remediation of sites contaminated by hazardous substances our operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws 

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations however both federal and state laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent making compliance with them increasingly expensive and burdensome in many instances the total costs of compliance are not readily quantifiable because compliance is so engrained in our operating philosophy that these costs are simply considered part of our standard operating procedures 

the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” has proposed or promulgated many new national ambient air quality standards and toxic air emissions rules for which it has recently or not yet issued guidance or compliance deadlines while we begin immediately to plan for compliance with such standards and rules we cannot fully assess their impact on our operations until the guidance has been fully developed or issued and compliance deadlines have been established in other cases where environmental regulations are proposed or promulgated that may regulate previously unregulated aspects of our operations it is impossible for us to fully determine the impact of these regulations until protracted legal challenges have been concluded and usepa or other regulatory agencies have developed and issued technical guidance despite this atmosphere of regulatory uncertainty at this time we do not believe that compliance with these new environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program administered by the states with civil and criminal enforcement sanctions each of our steel mills is required to operate in compliance with its permit or potentially incur sanctions for failing to do so because of the size of our steelmaking operations they are subject to new “greenhouse gasses” “ghgs” regulations and are required to do ghg best available control technology “bact” evaluations when their permits are modified there is still uncertainty and very little guidance from usepa as to what is or may be considered ghg bact for steelmaking operations our operations are currently properly permitted and we will not need to make these determinations unless and until these permits are modified based on current guidance we do not expect these requirements to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

  

nucor uses electric arc furnaces “eaf” to recycle scrap metal into new steel products these eafs use electricity as their primary source of energy as the new ghg regulations air toxics rules and other new environmental regulations are imposed on electric utilities it is reasonable to expect that the cost of electricity produced by these utilities will increase see item 1a “risk factors” for more information about the potential impact of ghg regulations on nucor’s business 

the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available 

rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling of and storage of most wastes while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered these and offsite properties that usepa has determined are contaminated for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level are quickly evaluated and corrected while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under rcra these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved 

because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor continually evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them 

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment this filtrant eaf dust is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both cercla and rcra 

nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use and has implemented sitewide recycling programs these environmental management systems make environmental commitment each nucor teammate’s responsibility nucor’s environmental program maintains a high level of training commitment outreach and visibility 

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2014 and 2015 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff we have fewer than 100 employees in our executive office the majority of nucor’s 22300 employees are not represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

recovery from the global recession and credit crisis has and likely will continue to adversely affect our business 

the continuing economic downturn as a result of the deep global recession that began in the united states in december 2007 and officially ended in june 2009 is continuing to have an adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows apprehension about the potential economic consequences of continuing domestic political wrangling over budgetary decisions and debt ceiling limits could negatively impact demand for our products in addition uncertainties in europe regarding the financial sector and debt crises and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world will continue to weigh on global and domestic growth 

although domestic credit markets have largely stabilized from the height of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 the effects of the financial crisis continue to present additional risks to us our customers and suppliers in particular there is no guarantee that the credit markets or liquidity will not once again be restricted additionally stricter lending standards have made it more difficult and costly for some firms to access the credit markets although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities these risks could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility in addition restricted access to the credit markets is also continuing to make it difficult or in some cases impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations lack of or limited access to capital would adversely affect our customers’ ability to purchase our products or in some cases to pay for our products on a timely basis 

longterm unemployment for those unemployed for more than six months remains high and the housing market and nonresidential construction market remain depressed high unemployment and a weak housing market have an impact on downstream demand for many of our products additionally nonresidential construction including publicly financed state and municipal projects has slowed significantly due to overcapacity of commercial properties and the reluctance of state and local governments to borrow to spend on capital projects when their operating expenses are in many cases growing faster than their revenues from taxes and other sources 

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy metals service centers appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the global economic recession of 20082009 and subsequent anemic economic recovery period coupled with the lingering effects of the global financial and credit market disruptions have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor these events contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel 

  

products weak endmarkets and continued depressed demand resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results since the last upcycle in 2009 we reported a net loss of 2936 million the first in the company’s history although we have since returned to profitability the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products future economic downturns or a prolonged slowgrowth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows over capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china brazil and other countries 

in particular steel production in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel continues to exceed chinese demand this rising overcapacity in china has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of artificially lowpriced steel and steel products to the united states that could put our steel products at a competitive disadvantage a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china 

the recent addition of new capacity and expansion or restarting of existing sheet steel production in the united states has exacerbated this issue domestically as well as globally 

competition from other producers imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business 

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including raw materials energy labor and capital costs government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum composites plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

since 2011 automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further oversupply of steel in north america certain automakers have announced that they will use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some 2015 models that will be available next year 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although we have vertically integrated our 

  

business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of our global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004 also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our natural gas working interest drilling programs 

the financial performance and condition of our natural gas drilling programs are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices of natural gas and liquids fluctuations in natural gas or liquids prices could have an adverse effect on the company’s natural gas operations and financial condition and the value and recovery of its reserves in the working interest drilling programs prices for natural gas and liquids fluctuate in response to changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company’s control a substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas could result in further delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling programs or curtailment in production at some properties all of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s revenues profitability and cash flows 

our steelmaking and dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs and regulation of ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor will be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly as ghg regulations are further implemented because these 

  

operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations we have already begun to feel the impact in the permit modification and reporting processes both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” which are more restrictive than previous standards make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits 

these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased the cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly to the extent that these regulations cause an increase in the cost of energy they will have an impact on nucor’s ability to compete 

the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants most of these and other related regulations are already or we expect will shortly be challenged in court until all proposed ghg emission regulations are adopted in final form and all legal challenges are resolved we cannot reliably estimate their full impact on our financial condition operating performance or ability to compete because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect cost increases our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

various legislative efforts at all levels are in process that are intended to further regulate the hydraulic fracturing process used by the oil and gas industry hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of natural gas wells in shale and tight sand formations including all of those in our working interest natural gas drilling program this process involves the injection of water chemicals and at times sand under pressure into rock formations to stimulate the production of natural gas oil and natural gas liquids sponsors of these proposals and regulations have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies andor that hydraulic fracturing could pose a variety of other risks any onerous governmental regulations could lead to operational delays increased operating costs that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and possibly even the cessation of drilling 

we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

  

in addition we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the us which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes unplanned critical equipment failures acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2013 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 344 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources 

changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results 

because of our international expansion efforts we are increasingly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates generally each of our foreign operations both produces and sells in its local currency limiting our exposure to foreign currency transactions we monitor our exposures and from time to time may use forward currency contracts to hedge certain forecasted currency transactions in addition to potential transaction losses our reported results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these longlived assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations 

tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the us nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws potential changes that would adversely affect us include but are not limited to current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates and eliminate most tax expenditures repealing lifo lastin firstout treatment of inventory accelerated depreciation and the domestic production activity deduction and decreasing the ability of us companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the us deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries 

  

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with governmental safety and environmental regulations contractual obligations and other legal standards notwithstanding this we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues including regulatory environmental employment intellectual property contractual and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend nucor has been named along with other major steel producers as a codefendant in several related antitrust classaction complaints filed by standard iron works and other steel purchasers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois the majority of these complaints were filed in september and october of 2008 with two additional complaints being filed in july and december of 2010 two of these complaints have been voluntarily dismissed and are no longer pending the plaintiffs allege that from april 1 2005 through december 31 2007 eight steel manufacturers including nucor engaged in anticompetitive activities with respect to the production and sale of steel the plaintiffs seek monetary and other relief although we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or estimate the range of nucor’s potential exposure 

nucor is from time to time a party to various lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business with respect to all such lawsuits claims and proceedings we record reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we do not believe that any of these proceedings individually or in the aggregate would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows nucor maintains liability insurance for certain risks that is subject to certain selfinsurance limits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2013 24 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 76 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2013 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand nucor utilizes a raw material surcharge as a component of pricing steel to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials in periods of stable demand for our products our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for and cost of raw materials is lower however the surcharge benefits our sales prices to a lesser extent 

natural gas produced by nucor’s working interest drilling program is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility in addition to its future natural gas needs at the new dri facility that began operations in the fourth quarter of 2013 nucor is also a substantial consumer of natural gas at our steel mill operations we expect that the natural gas produced through the drilling 

  

program will be sufficient to cover nucor’s demand at all of its steel mills in the united states plus the demand of two dri plants or alternatively at three dri plants however the natural gas production from the working interest drilling program currently does not completely cover the natural gas usage at our operating facilities for the year ended december 31 2013 the volume of natural gas sold from our natural gas working interest drilling program was approximately 73 of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities 

our natural gas working interest drilling program is affected by changes in natural gas prices in an inverse manner to natural gas costs at our dri and steel mill operations as natural gas prices increase our increased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations is somewhat mitigated by increased profit from sales of natural gas to third party customers from our natural gas drilling program likewise as natural gas prices decrease we experience decreased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations but we also experience decreased profit from our natural gas drilling program 

the impact of low natural gas prices associated with our drilling program is limited by the existence of a drilling suspension clause nucor is contractually obligated to drill a minimum number of wells per year under the terms of our original agreements with encana however we have the right to suspend drilling of new wells at any time after january 1 2015 if market pricing falls below a preestablished threshold in the fourth quarter of 2013 nucor and encana agreed to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells this joint decision was made due to the current weak natural gas pricing environment this pause demonstrates the flexibility of our partnership with encana to react to market conditions to the mutual benefit of both parties while still allowing us to better manage our exposure to natural gas pricing volatility at our operating divisions that consume natural gas 

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments from time to time primarily to partially manage our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process as well as scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2013 there were no amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to derivative instruments as all of our previously held positions have settled changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2013 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of tax or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk —nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe trinidad and colombia we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2013 and 2012 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation and its affiliates “nucor” or the “company” manufacture steel and steel products the company also produces direct reduced iron “dri” for use in the company’s steel mills through the david j joseph company and its affiliates “djj” which the company acquired in 2008 the company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and dri most of the company’s operating facilities and customers are located in north america but increasingly nucor is doing business outside of north america as well the company’s operations include several international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the company and others 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2012 we recycled approximately 192 million tons of scrap steel 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has employed a multipronged growth strategy in recent years that allows for the ability to capitalize on a variety of growth opportunities as they arise the five prongs of that growth strategy are 1 optimizing and continually improving our existing operations 2 executing on our raw materials strategy 3 growing through developing greenfield projects that capitalize on new technologies and unique marketplace opportunities 4 acquiring other companies that will strengthen nucor’s position as north america’s most diversified producer of steel and steel products and 5 growing internationally with an emphasis on leveraging strategic partnerships and new technologies 

optimizing our existing operations primarily has involved spending a significant portion of our capital expenditures each year on projects that enhance productivity and improve costs as well as allow us to produce more valueadded and typically higher margin products at our existing facilities the heat treat line at our hertford county north carolina mill became operational in 2010 which has allowed nucor to grow its presence in higher margin products where greater strength and abrasion resistance is required the heat treat line allows us to improve the product mix allocation between our two plate mills and four sheet mills to improve margins at those facilities also at the hertford county mill we commissioned a vacuum tank degasser in 2012 and we expect to begin operating a new normalizing line in 2013 early in 2012 nucor announced plans to spend approximately 290 million for projects at our tennessee nebraska and south carolina bar mills that should expand nucor’s special bar quality “sbq” and wire rod capacity by one million tons the projects which we expect to be completed between the end of 2013 and the first half of 2014 will allow us to produce engineered bar for the most demanding applications while maintaining our market share in commodity bar products by shifting production to our other bar mills other planned valueadded projects at existing operations include the vacuum tank degasser that began operating at our hickman arkansas mill in late 2012 and the modernization of casting hot rolling and downstream operations that will allow us to produce wider and lighter gauge hotrolled and coldrolled steel products at our berkeley south carolina mill beginning in early 2014 

executing on our raw materials strategy involves putting the pieces into place to meet our goal of controlling between six and seven million tons of annual capacity in high quality scrap substitutes our 2500000 metric tonsperyear dri facility in st james parish louisiana is scheduled to startup in mid2013 between our existing dri plant in trinidad which we expanded in 2011 to increase the annual capacity from 1800000 to 2000000 metric tons and our new facility in louisiana we will be approximately twothirds of the way towards that goal 

the drimaking process requires significant volumes of natural gas to provide the new dri plant in louisiana with a sustainable advantage from lower natural gas costs nucor entered into a longterm onshore natural gas working interest drilling program in usbased proven reserves with encana oil  gas usa inc 

  

“encana” in 2010 nucor entered into a second and more significant drilling program with encana in late 2012 the natural gas produced by these two programs will be sold to offset our exposure to the volatility of the price of natural gas consumed by the louisiana dri facility and our other operations we believe these drilling programs will allow us to better manage our exposure to natural gas pricing volatility and our overall energy demand for our operations 

growth through greenfield projects has included the construction of our sbq steel mill in memphis tennessee which we completed in 2009 we also began commercial production in 2009 at a new facility in blytheville arkansas which uses breakthrough castrip ® technology to strip cast molten steel into near final shape and thickness with minimal hot or cold rolling this allows for lower investment and operating costs and reduces the environmental impact of producing steel 

although the pace at which we have been acquiring other companies has slowed in the past few years the acquisition of skyline steel llc “skyline” in 2012 was a notable exception the skyline acquisition is an important strategic investment as it pairs skyline’s leadership position in the steel piling distribution market with our nucoryamato steel company “nucoryamato” joint venture’s position as the market leader in steel piling manufacturing to build upon the synergies in the piling market serviced by skyline nucor announced that nucoryamato will be expanding to broaden its range of hotrolled piling products upon completion in 2014 this project will add several new sheet piling sections increasing the single sheet widths by 22 and providing a lighter stronger sheet covering more area at a lower installed cost 

in 2010 we entered into an agreement with mitsui  co usa to form numit llc “numit” in which we own a 50 economic and voting interest numit owns 100 of the equity interest in steel technologies llc “steel technologies” which operates 25 sheet processing facilities located throughout the united states canada and mexico steel technologies recently finished construction on a flatrolled steel processing operation in celaya mexico that became operational in late 2012 the new 125000squarefoot facility is equipped with two slitting lines additionally construction is well underway on a new flatrolled steel processing facility that is expected to open in mid2013 in the bajio region of mexico these new investments should allow us to capitalize on the rapid growth in the mexican automotive industry 

segments 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2012 are set forth in note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in nucor’s 2012 annual report which is hereby incorporated by reference the steel mills are nucor’s dominant segment representing approximately 69 of the company’s sales to external customers in the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 

principal products produced 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces and distributes sheet steel hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks hpiling and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar and sbq nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills the steel mills segment also includes nucor’s equity method investments in duferdofin nucor srl and numit in the steel products segment nucor produces steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh in the raw materials segment the company produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal the raw materials segment also includes our natural gas working interest drilling programs with encana and certain equity method investments 

  

markets and marketing 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada mexico and increasingly elsewhere in the world nucor produces hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel in standard grades and to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders we estimate that slightly more than 55 of our sheet steel sales in 2012 were to contract customers the balance of our sheet steel sales was made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale the proportion of tons sold to contract customers at any given time depends on a variety of factors including our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons to maximize profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant 

our plate structural reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades which allows us to maintain inventory levels of these products to meet our customers’ expected orders in addition our bar mill group manufactures hotrolled sbq products to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors almost all of our plate structural and bar steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices 

in 2012 we sold approximately 85 of the production by our steel mills segment to external customers the balance of the steel mill segment’s production went to our piling distributor and our downstream joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 

in the steel products segment we sell steel joists and joist girders and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the united states and canada we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longerterm supply contracts may permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs we sell fabricated reinforcing products only on a construction contract bid basis these products are used by contractors in constructing highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings we manufacture cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders we sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the united states and canada 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces the markets for these products are largely tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions 

in the raw materials segment we process ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in our steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers we also broker ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes supply ferroalloys and provide transportation material handling and other services to users of scrap metals our primary external customers for ferrous scrap are electric arc furnace steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2012 approximately 11 of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons we processed were sold to external customers we used the balance in our steel mills 

also within the raw materials segment is our existing dri plant in trinidad that produces iron inputs exclusively for use in the nucor mills our dri facility that we are constructing in louisiana and our working interest drilling programs all natural gas produced by the working interest drilling programs is and will be sold to outside parties and as a result the revenues from these sales are a small but increasing amount of our revenues 

  

the company’s other operations include international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products that nucor and other steel producers have manufactured 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 164 billion and 180 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 118 billion and 111 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively order backlogs for the steel mills segment include orders attributable to nucor’s downstream businesses in addition to orders from outside customers the majority of these orders will be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used internally 

sources and availability of raw materials 

the primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron dri and hbi on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel as of december 31 2012 djj operated nearly 70 scrap recycling facilities and our annual scrap processing capability exceeded five million tons djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources and operate a dri plant in trinidad with a capacity of 2000000 metric tons annually the primary raw material for our dri facility in trinidad is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers we are constructing a second dri facility in louisiana with an annual capacity of 2500000 metric tons this louisiana dri facility is the first phase of a multiphase plan that is expected to include additional operations in louisiana 

in 2010 nucor entered into an agreement with encana that involves drilling and completing onshore natural gas wells in usbased proven reserves over an approximate sevenyear period that began in june 2010 nucor entered into a second and more extensive drilling agreement with encana in late 2012 that is projected to span more than 20 years natural gas produced by these working interest drilling programs is being sold to offset our exposure to the volatility of the price of gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility in addition to our natural gas needs at the new dri facility nucor is also a substantial consumer of natural gas at our steel mill operations the drilling of natural gas wells under the two agreements is expected to provide enough natural gas to equal nucor’s demand at all of its steel mills in the united states plus the demand of two dri plants or alternatively at three dri plants 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills 

djj generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in nucor’s steel mills djj does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the availability and price of ferrous scrap are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes are our single largest cost of products sold a key part of our business strategy is to control a significant portion of the supply of high quality metallics needed to operate our steel mills 

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas our dri facility in trinidad is and our louisiana dri facility will be large consumers of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges and our natural gas working interest drilling programs 

  

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefitted from relatively stable and competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on an equal footing in the increasingly global marketplace the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today however by many factors including changes in supply and demand advances in drilling technology and increasingly changes in public policy relating to energy production and use because energy is such a significant cost of products sold for nucor we strive continually to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global market place 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service 

our electricarc furnace steel mills face many different forms of competition including integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other electricarc furnace mills foreign imports and alternative materials large integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a wide variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs electricarc furnace mill producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with integrated steel producers 

recently we have experienced increased competition in the us sheet steel market stemming from significant domestic capacity increases despite the closure of some sheet mill assets in 2012 oversupply is still a significant issue also contributing to the excess capacity is the high level of imports that came into our country in 2012 these artificiallypriced imports make it very difficult for us to maintain sales prices and profit levels our average sales price per ton for sheet products dropped by 12 from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2012 in response to the increased competition 

competition from foreign steel and steel product producers presents unique challenges for us imported steel and steel products often benefit from government subsidies either directly or indirectly through governmentowned enterprises or governmentowned or controlled financial institutions foreign imports accounted for approximately 24 of the us steel market in 2012 in particular competition from steel imported from china which accounts for more than 45 of the steel produced annually in the world is a major challenge chinese producers many of whom are governmentowned in whole or in part continue to benefit from their government’s manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates and from the receipt of government subsidies which allow them to sell their products below cost these distorting trade practices are widely recognized as being unfair and have been challenged successfully as violating world trade rules examples of successful challenges include the imposition of antidumping duty orders on imports of line pipe oil country tubular goods rebar cuttolength plate and hotrolled sheet from china 

china’s aggresive trade practices seriously undermine the ability of the company and other domestic producers to compete on price when left unchallenged that country’s artificially lowered production costs have significantly contributed to the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the united states when such a flight occurs the us economy is weakened and nucor’s customer base is diminished thereby providing us with fewer opportunities to supply steel to those shuttered businesses rigorous trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign producers that engage in unlawful trade practices nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements and address the jobs crisis in the united states 

  

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives become more attractive to our customers 

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal 

environmental laws and regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment the principal federal environmental laws include the clean air act “caa” that regulates air emissions the clean water act “cwa” that regulates water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” that governs releases of and remediation of sites contaminated by hazardous substances our operations are also subject to state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws 

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations however both federal and state laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent making compliance with them increasingly expensive and burdensome in many instances the total costs of compliance are not readily quantifiable because compliance is so engrained in our operating philosophy that these costs are simply considered part of our standard operating procedures 

the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” has proposed or promulgated many new national ambient air quality standards and toxic air emissions rules for which it has recently or not yet issued guidance or compliance deadlines while we begin immediately to plan for compliance with such standards and rules we cannot fully assess their impact on our operations until the guidance has been fully developed or issued and compliance deadlines have been established in other cases where environmental regulations are proposed or promulgated that may regulate previously unregulated aspects of our operations it is impossible for us to fully determine the impact of these regulations until protracted legal challenges have been concluded and usepa or other regulatory agencies have developed and issued technical guidance despite this atmosphere of regulatory uncertainty at this time we do not believe that compliance with these new environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program administered by the states with civil and criminal enforcement sanctions each of our steel mills is required to operate in compliance with its permit or potentially incur sanctions for failing to do so our louisiana dri facility under construction was permitted under the caa in january 2011 this permit included an evaluation and determination of best available control technology “bact” for usepa’s new “greenhouse gasses” “ghgs” rule because of the size of our steelmaking operations they are also subject to these new ghg regulations and will be required to do ghg bact evaluations if their permits are modified in the future there is still uncertainty and very little guidance from usepa as to what is or may be considered ghg bact for steelmaking operations our operations are currently properly permitted and we will not need to make these determinations unless and until these permits are modified based on current guidance we do not expect these requirements to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

nucor uses electric arc furnaces “eaf” to recycle scrap metal into new steel products these eafs use electricity as their primary source of energy as the new ghg regulations air toxics rules and other new environmental regulations are imposed on electric utilities it is reasonable to expect that the cost of electricity produced by these utilities will increase see item 1a “risk factors” for more information about the potential impact of ghg regulations on nucor’s business 

  

the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available 

rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling of and storage of most wastes while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered these and offsite properties that usepa has determined are contaminated for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level are quickly evaluated and corrected while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under rcra these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved 

because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor continually evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them 

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment this filtrant eaf dust is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both cercla and rcra 

nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use and has implemented sitewide recycling programs these environmental management systems make environmental commitment each nucor teammate’s responsibility nucor’s environmental program maintains a high level of training commitment outreach and visibility 

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2013 and 2014 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff we have fewer than 100 employees in our executive office the majority of nucor’s 22200 employees are not represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

recovery from the global recession and credit crisis has and likely will continue to adversely affect our business 

the sluggish pace of the recovery from the deep global recession that began in the united states in december 2007 and officially ended in june 2009 is continuing to have an adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows in addition uncertainties in europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world will continue to weigh on global and domestic growth 

although domestic credit markets have largely stabilized from the height of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 the effects of the financial crisis continue to present additional risks to us our customers and suppliers in particular there is no guarantee that the credit markets or liquidity will not once again be restricted additionally stricter lending standards have made it more difficult and costly for some firms to access the credit markets although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities these risks could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility in addition restricted access to the credit markets is also continuing to make it difficult or in some cases impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations lack of or limited access to capital would adversely affect our customers’ ability to purchase our products or in some cases to pay for our products on a timely basis 

longterm unemployment for those unemployed for more than six months remains at historically high levels and the housing market and nonresidential construction market remain depressed high unemployment and a weak housing market have an impact on downstream demand for many of our products additionally nonresidential construction including publicly financed state and municipal projects has slowed significantly due to overcapacity of commercial properties and the reluctance of state and local governments to borrow to spend on capital projects when their operating expenses are in many cases growing faster than their revenues from taxes and other sources 

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have a material adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the global economic recession of 20082009 and subsequent anemic economic recovery period coupled with the lingering effects of the global financial and credit market disruptions have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor these events contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel products weak endmarkets 

  

and continued depressed demand resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results since the last upcycle in 2009 we reported a net loss of 2936 million the first in the company’s history although we have since returned to profitability the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products future economic downturns or a prolonged slowgrowth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows over capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china brazil and other countries 

in particular steel production in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel continues to exceed chinese demand this rising overcapacity in china has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of artificially lowpriced steel and steel products to the united states that could put our steel products at a competitive disadvantage a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china 

the recent addition of new capacity and expansion or restarting of existing sheet steel production in the united states has exacerbated this issue domestically as well as globally 

competition from other producers imports or alternative materials may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including raw materials energy labor and capital costs government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum composites plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

in 2011 automobile producers began taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy “cafe” mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may reduce the amount of steel in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further oversupply of steel in north america 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although we have vertically integrated our business 

  

by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of our global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004 also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our natural gas working interest drilling programs 

the financial performance and condition of our natural gas drilling programs are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices of natural gas and liquids fluctuations in natural gas or liquids prices could have an adverse effect on the company’s natural gas operations and financial condition and the value and recovery of its reserves in the working interest drilling programs prices for natural gas and liquids fluctuate in response to changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company’s control a substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas could result in a delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling programs or curtailment in production at some properties all of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s revenues profitability and cash flows 

our steelmaking and dri processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs and regulation of ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor will be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly as ghg regulations are further implemented because these operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations we have already begun to feel the impact in the 

  

permit modification and reporting processes both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” which are more restrictive than previous standards make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits if one of our permits is revoked or if we experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification we could experience operational delays at one or more of our facilities causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased the cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly to the extent that these regulations cause an increase in the cost of energy they will have an impact on nucor’s ability to compete 

the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants most of these and other related regulations are already or we expect will shortly be challenged in court until all proposed ghg emission regulations are adopted in final form and all legal challenges are resolved we cannot reliably estimate their full impact on our financial condition operating performance or ability to compete because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect cost increases our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

congress has considered legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process and other legislation regulating hydraulic fracturing has been considered and in some cases adopted at various levels of government hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional natural gas wells in shale and tight sand formations including all of those in our drilling program this process involves the injection of water chemicals and at times sand under pressure into rock formations to stimulate the production of natural gas oil and natural gas liquids sponsors of these bills have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies andor that hydraulic fracturing could pose a variety of other risks any onerous governmental regulations could lead to operational delays increased operating costs that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and possibly even the cessation of drilling 

we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

  

in addition we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the us which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural or manmade disasters acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2012 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 323 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources 

changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results 

because of our international expansion efforts we are increasingly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates generally each of our foreign operations both produces and sells in its local currency limiting our exposure to foreign currency transactions we monitor our exposures and from time to time may use forward currency contracts to hedge certain forecasted currency transactions in addition to potential transaction losses our reported results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these longlived assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations 

tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the us nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws potential changes that would adversely affect us include but are not limited to current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates and eliminate most tax expenditures repealing lifo lastin firstout treatment of inventory accelerated depreciation and the domestic production activity deduction and decreasing the ability of us companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the us deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend nucor has been named along with other major steel producers as a codefendant in several related antitrust classaction complaints filed by standard iron works and other steel purchasers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois the majority of these complaints were filed in september and october of 2008 with two additional complaints being filed in july and december of 2010 two of these complaints have been voluntarily dismissed and are no longer pending the plaintiffs allege that from april 1 2005 through december 31 2007 eight steel manufacturers including nucor engaged in anticompetitive activities with respect to the production and sale of steel the plaintiffs seek monetary and other relief although we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or estimate the range of nucor’s potential exposure 

nucor is involved in various other judicial and administrative proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant arising in the ordinary course of business nucor maintains liability insurance for certain risks that arise that are also subject to certain selfinsurance limits although the outcome of the claims and proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that there are no existing claims or proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2012 28 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 72 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2012 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as shortterm investments 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand we employ a raw material surcharge as a component of pricing steel to facilitate the passing through of increased costs of scrap steel and other raw materials in periods of stable demand for our products our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for and cost of raw materials is lower however the surcharge impacts our sales prices to a lesser extent 

our natural gas working interest drilling programs are affected by volatility of natural gas prices in an inverse manner to natural gas costs at our steel production and dri facilities this relationship is part of the value proposition and why these drilling programs serve as a natural hedge to price volatility of the natural gas we use in our steel production and dri facilities 

  

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2012 there are no amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to derivative instruments as all of our previously held positions have settled changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2012 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of tax or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk —nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada europe trinidad and colombia we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2012 and 2011 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation and its affiliates “nucor” or the “company” manufacture steel and steel products the company also produces direct reduced iron “dri” for use in the company’s steel mills through the david j joseph company and its affiliates “djj” which the company acquired in 2008 the company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and dri most of the company’s operating facilities and customers are located in north america but increasingly nucor is doing business outside of north america as well the company’s operations include several international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the company and others 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2011 we recycled approximately 197 million tons of scrap steel 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has employed a multipronged growth strategy in recent years that allows for flexibility and the ability to capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise the five prongs of that growth strategy are 1 optimizing existing operations 2 executing on our raw materials strategy 3 growing through developing greenfield projects that capitalize on new technologies and unique marketplace opportunities 4 acquiring other companies that will strengthen nucor’s position as north america’s most diversified producer of steel and steel products and 5 growing internationally with an emphasis on leveraging strategic partnerships and new technologies 

optimizing our existing operations has primarily involved targeting a significant portion of our capital expenditures each year on projects that enhance productivity and efficiency as well as allow us to produce products that move us up the value chain at our existing facilities the heat treat line at our hertford county north carolina mill became operational in 2010 which has allowed nucor to grow its presence in higher margin products where higher strength and abrasion resistance is required the heat treat line has also allowed us to improve the product mix allocation between our two plate mills and four sheet mills to improve margins at those facilities nucor has announced plans to spend approximately 290 million for projects at our tennessee nebraska and south carolina bar mills that will expand nucor’s special bar quality “sbq” and wire rod capacity by one million tons the projects which we project will be completed by the end of 2013 will allow us to meet the needs of our engineered bar customers in the attractive automotive energy heavy truck and heavy equipment markets other planned valueadded projects at existing operations include a vacuum degasser at our hickman arkansas mill and a new mill stand and other modifications that will allow us to produce wider and lighter gauge hotrolled steel at our berkeley south carolina mill 

executing on our raw materials strategy involves putting the pieces into place to meet our goal of controlling between six and seven million tons of annual capacity in high quality scrap substitutes we have begun construction on our 2500000 tonsperyear dri facility in st james parish louisiana the majority of the equipment for this 750 million project will begin arriving in 2012 and startup is currently projected to be in mid2013 between our existing dri plant in trinidad which we have expanded to increase the annual capacity from 1800000 to 2000000 metric tons and our facility in st james parish louisiana we will be approximately twothirds of the way towards that goal 

  

growing through greenfield projects has included the construction of our sbq steel mill in memphis tennessee which we completed in 2009 we also began commercial production in 2009 at a new facility in blytheville arkansas which uses breakthrough castrip ® technology to strip cast molten steel into near final shape and thickness with minimal hot or cold rolling this allows for lower investment and operating costs and reduces the environmental impact of producing steel 

the pace at which we have been acquiring other companies slowed dramatically in late 2008 but in the preceding four years we completed numerous acquisitions since late 2006 our annual capacity to produce downstream valueadded products has more than doubled to over 46 million tons through acquisitions of a steel decking producer fabricators of rebar cold finished bars and steel grating a manufacturer of metal buildings and a wire mesh fabricator the acquisition of djj in the spring of 2008 was a key part of our strategy to better manage the supply of ferrous scrap metal the primary raw material used by our electric arc furnace steel mills 

in 2010 we entered into an agreement with mitsui  co usa to form numit llc in which we own a 50 economic and voting interest numit llc owns 100 of the equity interest in steel technologies llc which operates 25 sheet processing facilities located throughout the united states canada and mexico 

in 2008 we grew internationally by entering into a joint investment with duferco sa duferdofin nucor srl which operates a one million tonsperyear steel melt shop with a bloom billet caster in brescia italy and three rolling mills located throughout italy the customers for the products produced by duferdofin nucor srl are primarily steel service centers and distributors located both in italy and throughout europe 

segments 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2011 are set forth in note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in nucor’s 2011 annual report which is hereby incorporated by reference the steel mills are nucor’s dominant segment representing approximately 70 of the company’s sales to external customers in the fiscal year ended december 31 2011

in the steel mills segment nucor produces sheet steel hot and coldrolled plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar and sbq nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills in the steel products segment nucor produces steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems light gauge steel framing steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh in the raw materials segment the company produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal 

  

markets and marketing 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada mexico and increasingly elsewhere in the world nucor produces hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel in standard grades and to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders in 2011 approximately 50 of our sheet steel sales were to contract customers while steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant the proportion of tons sold to contract customers depends on a variety of factors these factors include our consideration of current and future market conditions our strategy to appropriately balance spot and contract tons to maximize profitability our desire to sustain a diversified customer base and our enduse customers’ perceptions about future market conditions these sheet sales contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months the balance of our sheet steel sales was in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale 

our plate structural reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades whereby we maintain inventory levels to meet our customers’ expected orders in addition our bar mill group manufactures hotrolled sbq products to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors almost all of our plate structural and bar steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices 

in 2011 approximately 86 of the production by our steel mills segment was sold to external customers the balance of the steel mill segment’s production went to our downstream joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 

in the steel products segment we sell steel joists and joist girders and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the united states we make these products to the customers’ specifications and do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longer term supply contracts may permit us to adjust our prices to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs we sell fabricated reinforcing products only on a construction contract bid basis these products are used by contractors in constructing highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings we manufacture cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders we sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the united states and canada 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces the markets for these products are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions 

in the raw materials segment the company processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in nucor’s steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers the company also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes supplies ferroalloys and provides transportation material handling and other services to users of scrap metals the primary external customers for ferrous scrap are electric arc furnace steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2011 approximately 12 of the ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes tons processed and sold by the raw materials segment were sold to external customers 

  

the company’s other operations include international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products that nucor and other steel producers have manufactured 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 180 billion and 164 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 111 billion and 102 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively order backlogs for the steel mills segment include orders attributable to nucor’s downstream businesses the majority of these orders will be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used by internal divisions 

sources and availability of raw materials 

the primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron dri and hbi on average it takes approximately 11 tons of scrap and scrap substitutes to produce a ton of steel as of december 31 2011 djj operated over 60 scrap yards and the company’s annual scrap processing capability was approaching five million tons djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources nucor operates a dri plant in trinidad with a capacity of 1800000 metric tons of dri annually an expansion project has now increased the capacity to 2000000 metric tons annually the primary raw material for our dri facility in trinidad is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers a second dri facility in louisiana with an annual capacity of 2500000 tons is under construction this louisiana dri facility is the first phase of a multiphase plan that may include an additional dri facility a coke plant a blast furnace a pellet plant and a steel mill 

in 2010 nucor entered into an agreement with a natural gas exploration and production firm that involves drilling and completing onshore natural gas wells in usbased proven reserves over a sevenyear period that began in june 2010 natural gas generated by this working interest drilling program is being sold to offset our exposure to the volatility of the price of gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility revenues from natural gas generated by this working interest drilling program are a small but increasing amount and all natural gas is being sold to outside parties 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills 

djj generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in nucor’s steel mills djj does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the availability and price of ferrous scrap are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes are our single largest cost of products sold a key part of our business strategy is to control a significant portion of the supply of high quality metallics needed to operate our steel mills 

  

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas our dri facility in trinidad is and the dri facility we are currently constructing in louisiana will be large consumers of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges and a working interest agreement with a leading natural gas production firm to drill onshore natural gas wells in the united states 

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefitted from relatively stable and competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on an equal footing in the increasingly global marketplace the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today however by many factors including changes in supply and demand advances in drilling technology and increasingly by changes in public policy relating to energy production and use because energy is such a significant cost of products sold for nucor we are continually striving to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also closely monitor developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global market place 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many domestic and foreign firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service 

our electricarc furnace steel mills face many different forms of competition including integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other electricarc furnace mills foreign imports and alternative materials our unfinished and finished steel products face domestic competition from both integrated steel producers and other electricarc furnace mills large integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a wide variety of products but face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs electricarc furnace mill producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with integrated steel producers 

recently we have experienced increased competition in the us sheet steel market stemming from significant capacity increases since the beginning of 2010 domestic sheet capacity has increased by approximately 5000000 tons as a result of the opening of a new sheet facility in alabama capacity additions at existing sheet mills and the reopening of a previously shuttered sheet mill in maryland 

competition from foreign steel and steel product producers presents unique challenges for us imported steel and steel products often benefit from government subsidies either directly or indirectly through governmentowned enterprises or governmentowned or controlled financial institutions foreign imports accounted for approximately 22 of the us steel market in 2011 in particular competition from steel imported from china which accounts for more than 40 of the steel produced annually in the world is a major challenge chinese producers many of which are governmentowned in whole or in part continue to benefit from their government’s manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates and from the receipt of government subsidies which allows them to sell their products below cost these distorting trade practices are not only widely recognized as being unfair but also have been challenged 

  

successfully in some recent instances as violating world trade rules examples of successful challenges include the imposition of antidumping duty orders on imports of line pipe oil country tubular goods rebar cuttolength plate and hot rolled sheet from china 

china’s unfair trade practices seriously undermine the ability of the company and other domestic producers to compete on price when left unchallenged that country’s artificially lowered production costs have significantly contributed to the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the united states when such a flight occurs nucor’s customer base is diminished thereby providing us with fewer opportunities to supply steel to those shuttered businesses rigorous trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign producers that engage in unlawful trade practices nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements and address the jobs crisis in the united states numerous downstream consumers of steel are also taking action against unfairly traded chinese imports as demonstrated by recently filed cases on steel wheels and wind towers from china 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives become more attractive to our customers 

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal 

environmental laws and regulations 

our business operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment the principal federal environmental laws include the clean air act “caa” that regulates air emissions the clean water act “cwa” that regulates water discharges the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” that governs releases of and remediation of sites contaminated by hazardous substances the states in which our operations are located also have state laws and regulations that are patterned on these and other federal laws 

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the provisions of all federal and state environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business operations both federal and state laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent however making compliance with them increasingly expensive and burdensome in many instances the total costs of compliance are not readily quantifiable because compliance is so engrained in our operating philosophy that these costs are simply considered part of our standard operating procedures 

the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” has proposed or promulgated many new national ambient air quality standards and toxic air emissions rules for which it has not yet issued guidance or compliance deadlines while we begin immediately to plan for compliance with such standards and rules we cannot fully assess their impact on our operations until the guidance has been fully developed and issued and compliance deadlines have been established in other cases where environmental regulations are proposed or promulgated that may regulate previously unregulated aspects of our operations it is impossible for us to fully determine the impact of these regulations until protracted legal challenges have been concluded and usepa or other regulatory agencies have developed and issued 

  

technical guidance despite this atmosphere of regulatory uncertainty at this time we do not believe that compliance with these new environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program administered by the states with civil and criminal enforcement sanctions each of our steel mills is required to operate in compliance with its permit or potentially incur sanctions for failing to do so the dri facility we are constructing in louisiana was permitted under the caa in january 2011 this permit included an evaluation and determination of best available control technology “bact” for usepa’s new “greenhouse gasses” “ghgs” rule because of the size of our steelmaking operations they are also subject to these new ghg regulations and will be required to do ghg bact evaluations if their permits are modified in the future there is still a great deal of uncertainty and very little guidance from usepa as to what is or may be considered ghg bact for steelmaking operations our operations are properly permitted and we will not need to make these determinations unless and until their permits are modified based on current guidance we do not expect these requirements to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

nucor uses electric arc furnaces “eaf” to recycle scrap metal into new steel products these eafs use electricity as their primary source of energy as the new ghg regulations air toxics rules and other new environmental regulations are imposed on electric utilities it is reasonable to expect that the cost of electricity produced by these utilities will increase see item 1a “risk factors” for more information about the potential impact of ghg regulations on nucor’s business 

the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available 

rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling of and storage of most wastes while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered these and offsite properties that usepa has determined are contaminated for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level are quickly evaluated and corrected while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under rcra these liabilities are either already identified and being resolved or have been fully resolved and nucor is in receipt of no further action letters from the appropriate regulatory agency 

because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party nucor continually evaluates these types of potential liabilities and if appropriate maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities under rcra private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them 

  

the primary raw material of nucor’s steelmaking operations is scrap metal the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint zinc chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in nucor emission control equipment this filtrant eaf dust is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra because these contaminants contain valuable metals this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc lead chrome and other valuable metals from this dust by recycling this material nucor is not only acting in a sustainable responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both cercla and rcra 

nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance all of nucor’s steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor’s steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use and has implemented sitewide recycling programs these environmental management systems make environmental commitment each nucor teammate’s responsibility nucor’s environmental program maintains a high level of training commitment outreach and visibility 

capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2012 and 2013 are estimated to be less than 100 million per year 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff less than 100 employees are located in our executive office the majority of nucor’s 20800 employees are not represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

recovery from the global recession and credit crisis has and likely will continue to adversely affect our business 

the sluggish pace of the recovery from the deep global recession that began in the united states in december 2007 and officially ended in june 2009 is continuing to have an adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows in addition uncertainties in europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world will continue to weigh on global and domestic growth 

  

although domestic credit markets have largely stabilized from the height of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 the effects of the financial crisis continue to present additional risks to us our customers and suppliers in particular there is no guarantee that the credit markets or liquidity will not once again be restricted additionally stricter lending standards have made it more difficult for some firms to access the credit markets although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities these risks could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility in addition restricted access to the credit markets is also continuing to make it difficult or in some cases impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations lack of or limited access to capital would adversely affect our customers’ ability to purchase our products or in some cases to pay for our products on a timely basis 

longterm unemployment for those unemployed for more than six months remains at historically high levels and the housing market and nonresidential construction market remain depressed high unemployment and a weak housing market have an impact on downstream demand for many of our products additionally nonresidential construction including publicly financed state and municipal projects has slowed significantly due to overcapacity of commercial properties and the reluctance of state and local governments to borrow to spend on capital projects when faced with stagnant or declining tax revenues and increased operating costs 

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have a material adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the global economic recession of 20082009 and subsequent anemic economic recovery period coupled with the lingering effects of the global financial and credit market disruptions have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor these events contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel products weak endmarkets and continued depressed demand resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results since the last upcycle in 2009 we reported a net loss of 2936 million the first in the company’s history we returned to profitability in 2010 and 2011 reporting net income of 1341 million and 7782 million respectively however the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products future economic downturns or a prolonged slowgrowth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market 

  

international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in particular steel production in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel currently exceeds chinese demand and in recent years the production growth rate has exceeded the growth rate of demand this rising overcapacity in china has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of lowpriced unfairly traded steel and steel products to the united states that could put our steel products at a competitive disadvantage a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china 

the recent addition of new capacity and expansion or restarting of existing sheet steel production in the united states has exacerbated this issue domestically as well as globally 

competition from other producers imports or alternative materials may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including raw materials energy labor and capital costs government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum composites plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

in 2011 automobile producers began taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy “cafe” mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may reduce the amount of steel in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further oversupply of steel in north america 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facility in trinidad and acquiring djj we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities purchase prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of our global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

  

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004 also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas in addition our dri facility is also a large consumer of natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not applicable across the entire steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our steelmaking processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs and regulation of ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor will be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly as ghg regulations are further implemented because nucor’s steelmaking operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations we have already begun to feel the impact in the permit modification and reporting processes both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national ambient air quality standards “naaqs” which are more restrictive than previous standards make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased the cost of energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and “fracking” is dampening some of this indirect impact as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly to the extent that these regulations cause an increase in the cost of energy they will have an impact on nucor’s ability to compete 

the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants most of these and other related regulations are already or we expect will shortly be challenged in court until all proposed ghg emission regulations are adopted in final form and all legal challenges to them including the authority of the usepa to adopt them have been resolved however we cannot reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition operating performance or ability to compete because some foreign steel producers will not be subject to these same indirect cost increases our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to ghg regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change 

  

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted 

we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

in addition we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the us which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural or manmade disasters acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2011 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 273 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources 

changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results 

because of our international expansion efforts we are increasingly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates generally each of our foreign operations both produces and sells in its local currency limiting our exposure to foreign currency transactions we monitor our exposures and from time to time may use forward currency contracts to hedge certain forecasted currency transactions in addition to potential transaction losses our reported results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

  

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these longlived assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet we would likely incur a noncash impairment loss that will negatively impact our results of operations 

tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the us nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws potential changes that would adversely affect us include but are not limited to repealing lifo lastin firstout treatment of inventory and decreasing the ability of us companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the us deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend nucor has been named along with other major steel producers as a codefendant in several related antitrust classaction complaints filed by standard iron works and other steel purchasers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois the plaintiffs allege that from january 2005 to the present eight steel manufacturers including nucor engaged in anticompetitive activities with respect to the production and sale of steel the plaintiffs seek monetary and other relief although we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or estimate the range of nucor’s potential exposure 

in the course of normal compliance evaluation in 2008 at our steel mill in marion ohio we discovered and selfdisclosed to the ohio environmental protection agency the “ohio epa” that the facility had failed to properly permit modifications to its power supply the ohio epa has since issued notices of violation for this incident and ancillary issues arising from it the ohio epa has assessed a civil penalty that will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we expect to settle this matter in 2012 

nucor is involved in various other judicial and administrative proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant arising in the ordinary course of business nucor does not believe that any such proceedings including matters relating to contracts torts taxes warranties and insurance will have a material adverse effect on its business operating results financial condition or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk – nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2011 24 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 76 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2011 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 

commodity price risk – in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand nucor utilizes a raw material surcharge as a component of pricing steel to facilitate the passing through of increased costs of scrap steel and other raw materials in periods of stable demand for our products our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for and cost of raw materials is lower however the surcharge impacts our sales prices to a lesser extent 

  

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2011 accumulated other comprehensive income loss included 403 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2011 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of tax or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk – nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada europe trinidad and australia we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2011 and 2010 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation and its affiliates “nucor” or the “company” manufacture steel and steel products the company also produces direct reduced iron “dri” for use in the company’s steel mills through the david j joseph company and its affiliates “djj” which the company acquired in 2008 the company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and dri most of the company’s operating facilities and customers are located in north america but increasingly nucor is doing business outside of north america as well the company’s operations include several international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the company and others 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products in 2010 we recycled approximately 17 million tons of scrap steel 

general development of our business in recent years 

nucor has employed a multipronged growth strategy in recent years that allows for flexibility and the ability to capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise the four prongs of that growth strategy have been 1 optimizing existing operations 2 growing through developing greenfield projects that capitalize on new technologies and unique marketplace opportunities 3 acquiring other companies that will strengthen nucor’s position as north america’s most diversified producer of steel and steel products and 4 growing internationally with an emphasis on leveraging strategic partnerships and new technologies 

optimizing our existing operations has primarily involved targeting a significant portion of our capital expenditures each year on projects that will enhance the productivity and efficiency of our existing facilities we have also capitalized upon any production downtime during the economic downturn of the past few years to develop new product offerings at our existing operations growing through greenfield projects has included the construction of our special bar quality steel mill in memphis tennessee which we completed in 2009 we also began commercial production in 2009 at a new facility in blytheville arkansas which uses breakthrough castrip ® technology to strip cast molten steel into near final shape and thickness with minimal hot or cold rolling allowing lower investment and operating costs the castrip technology also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions than traditional steel producing technologies in late 2010 we announced that we have selected st james parish louisiana as the site where we plan to construct a new dri facility with a capacity of 2500000 tons of dri per year 

the pace at which we have been acquiring other companies slowed dramatically in late 2008 but in the preceding four years we completed numerous acquisitions since late 2006 our annual capacity to produce downstream valueadded products has more than doubled to over 45 million tons through acquisitions of a steel decking producer fabricators of rebar cold finished bars and steel grating a manufacturer of metal buildings and a wire mesh fabricator the acquisition of djj in the spring of 2008 was a key part of our strategy to better manage the supply of ferrous scrap metal the primary raw material used by our electric arc furnace steel mills 

in 2008 we grew internationally by opening a european office and entering into a joint investment with duferco sa duferdofin nucor srl which operates a one million tonsperyear steel melt shop with a bloom billet caster in brescia italy and four rolling mills located throughout italy the customers for the products produced by duferdofin nucor srl are primarily steel service centers and distributors located in italy southern europe and north africa 

  

in 2010 we entered into an agreement with mitsui  co usa to form a newly created company numit llc in which we own a 50 economic and voting interest numit llc owns 100 of the equity interest in steel technologies llc which operates 23 sheet processing facilities located throughout the united states canada and mexico 

segments 

nucor reports its results in three segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2010 are set forth in note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in nucor’s 2010 annual report which is hereby incorporated by reference the steel mills are nucor’s dominant segment representing approximately 69 of the company’s sales to external customers in the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 

principal products produced 

in the steel mills segment nucor produces sheet steel hot and coldrolled plate steel structural steel wideflange beams beam blanks and sheet piling and bar steel blooms billets concrete reinforcing bar merchant bar and special bar quality nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel substitutes using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills in the steel products segment nucor produces steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems light gauge steel framing steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh in the raw materials segment the company produces dri brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal 

markets and marketing 

the steel mills segment sells its products primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers located throughout the united states canada mexico and increasingly elsewhere in the world nucor produces hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel in standard grades and to customers’ specifications while maintaining inventories to fulfill anticipated orders in 2010 approximately 40 of our sheet steel sales were to contract customers these contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months the balance of our sheet steel sales was in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale 

our plate structural reinforcing and merchant bar steel come in standard sizes and grades whereby we maintain inventory levels to meet our customers’ expected orders in addition our bar mill group manufactures hotrolled special bar quality products to exacting specifications primarily servicing the automotive energy agricultural heavy equipment and transportation sectors almost all of our plate structural and bar steel sales occur in the spot market at prevailing market prices 

in 2010 approximately 87 of the production by our steel mills segment was sold to external customers the balance of the steel mill segment’s production went to our downstream joist deck rebar fabrication fastener metal buildings and cold finish operations 

in the steel products segment we sell steel joists and joist girders and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators located throughout the united states that we make to their order we do not maintain inventories of these finished steel products the majority of these contracts are firm fixedprice contracts that are in most cases competitively bid against other suppliers longer term supply contracts may permit us to adjust our prices to 

  

reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs we sell fabricated reinforcing products only on a construction contract bid basis these products are used by contractors in constructing highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings we manufacture cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh in standard sizes and maintain inventories of these products to fulfill anticipated orders we sell cold finished steel and steel fasteners primarily to distributors and manufacturers located throughout the united states and canada 

we market products from the steel mills and steel products segments mainly through inhouse sales forces the markets for these products are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in general economic conditions 

in the raw materials segment the company processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for use in nucor’s steel mills and for sale to various domestic and international external customers the company also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals and scrap substitutes supplies ferroalloys and provides transportation material handling and other services to users of scrap metals the primary external customers for ferrous scrap are electric arc furnace steel mills and foundries that use ferrous scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process external customers purchasing nonferrous scrap metal include aluminum can producers secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals we market scrap metal products and related services to our external customers through inhouse sales forces in 2010 approximately 13 of the ferrous and nonferrous scrap tons processed and sold by the raw materials segment were sold to external customers 

the company’s other operations include international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products that nucor and other steel producers have manufactured 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 164 billion and 104 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 102 billion and 9546 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively order backlogs for the steel mills segment include orders attributable to nucor’s downstream businesses the majority of these orders will be filled within one year order backlog within our raw materials segment is not significant because the majority of the raw materials that segment produces are used by internal divisions 

sources and availability of raw materials 

the primary raw materials for our steel mills segment are ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes such as pig iron dri and hbi as of december 31 2010 djj operated 59 scrap yards and the company’s annual scrap processing capability was approaching five million tons djj acquires ferrous scrap from numerous sources including manufacturers of products made from steel industrial plants scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers and demolition firms we purchase pig iron as needed from a variety of sources nucor operates a dri plant in trinidad with a capacity of 1800000 metric tons of dri annually the primary raw material for our dri facility in trinidad is iron ore which we purchase from various international suppliers nucor has announced plans to construct a second dri facility in the state of louisiana at a location on the mississippi river with a capacity of 2500000 tons of dri annually during the second quarter of 2010 nucor entered into an agreement with a natural gas exploration and production firm that will involve drilling and completing onshore natural gas wells in usbased proven reserves over a sevenyear period that began in june 2010 natural gas generated by this working interest drilling program will be sold to offset our exposure to the volatility of the price of gas consumed by our planned louisiana dri facility 

the primary raw material for our steel products segment is steel produced by nucor’s steel mills 

  

djj generally purchases ferrous and nonferrous scrap for sale to external customers from the same variety of sources it purchases ferrous scrap for use as a raw material in nucor’s steel mills djj does not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the availability and price of ferrous scrap are affected by changes in the global supply and demand for steel and steel products ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes are our single largest cost of products sold a key part of our business strategy is to control a significant portion of the supply of high quality metallics needed to operate our steel mills 

energy consumption and costs 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas our dri facility in trinidad is and the dri facility we are planning to construct in louisiana will be a large consumer of natural gas consequently we use a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to price risk of natural gas including cash flow hedges and a working interest agreement with a leading natural gas production firm to drill onshore natural gas wells in the united states 

historically manufacturers in the united states have benefitted from relatively stable and competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on an equal footing in the increasingly global marketplace the availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today however by many factors including changes in supply and demand advances in drilling technology and increasingly by changes in public policy relating to energy production and use because energy is such a significant cost of products sold for nucor we are continually striving to make our operations in all three of our business segments more energy efficient we also monitor closely developments in public policy relating to energy production and consumption when appropriate we work to shape those developments in ways that we believe will allow us to continue to be a competitive producer of steel and steel products in an increasingly competitive global market place 

competition 

we compete in a variety of steel and metal markets including markets for finished steel products unfinished steel products and raw materials these markets are highly competitive with many firms participating and as a result of this highly competitive environment we find that we primarily compete on price and service 

our electricarc furnace steel mills face many different forms of competition including integrated steel producers who use iron ore converted into liquid form in a blast furnace as their basic raw material instead of scrap steel other electricarc furnace mills foreign imports and alternative materials our unfinished and finished steel products face domestic competition from both integrated steel producers and other electricarc furnace mills large integrated steel producers have the ability to manufacture a wide variety of products but they face significantly higher energy costs and are often burdened with higher capital and fixed operating costs electricarc furnace mill producers such as nucor are sensitive to increases in scrap prices but tend to have lower capital and fixed operating costs compared with integrated steel producers 

competition from foreign steel and steel product producers presents unique challenges for us imported steel often benefits from government subsidies either directly or indirectly through governmentowned enterprises or governmentowned or controlled financial institutions foreign imports accounted for approximately 21 of the us steel market in 2010 in particular competition from steel imported from china which accounts for more than 40 of the steel produced annually in the world is a major challenge chinese producers many of which are governmentowned in whole or in part continue to benefit from their government’s manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates and from the receipt of government subsidies which allows them to sell their products below cost these distorting trade practices are not only widely recognized as being unfair but also have been challenged successfully as violating world trade rules in some recent instances one of many recent examples occurred when the united states international trade commission mandated an antidumping duty order on imports of certain oil country tubular goods from china because it determined that those products are sold in the united states at less than fair value 

  

the chinese unfair trade practices seriously undermine the ability of the company and other domestic producers to compete on price when left unchallenged china’s artificially lowered production costs have significantly contributed to the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the united states when such a flight occurs nucor’s customer base is diminished thereby providing us with fewer opportunities to supply steel to those shuttered businesses rigorous trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign producers that engage in unlawful trade practices nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements and address the jobs crisis in the united states 

we also experience competition from other materials depending on our customers’ end use of our products there are sometimes other materials such as concrete aluminum plastics composites and wood that compete with our steel products when the price of steel relative to other raw materials rises these alternatives become more attractive to our customers 

competition in our scrap and raw materials business is also vigorous the scrap metals market consists of many firms and is highly fragmented firms typically compete on price and geographic proximity to the sources of scrap metal 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff only 90 employees are located in our executive office the majority of nucor’s 20500 employees are not represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

recovery from the global recession and credit crisis has and likely will continue to adversely affect our business 

the sluggish pace of the recovery from the deep global recession that began in the united states in december 2007 and officially ended in june 2009 is continuing to have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows 

although credit markets have largely stabilized from the height of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 the effects of the financial crisis continue to present additional risks to us our customers and suppliers in particular there is no guarantee that the credit markets or liquidity will not once again be restricted additionally stricter lending standards have made it more difficult for some firms to access the credit markets although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities these risks could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money 

  

on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility in addition restricted access to the credit markets is also continuing to make it difficult or in some cases impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations their lack of or limited access to capital would adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or in some cases to pay for our products on a timely basis 

longterm unemployment for those unemployed for more than six months remains at historically high levels and the housing market and nonresidential construction market remain depressed high unemployment and a weak housing market have an impact on downstream demand for many of our products additionally nonresidential construction including publicly financed state and municipal projects has slowed significantly due to overcapacity of commercial properties and the reluctance of state and local governments to borrow to spend on capital projects when faced with stagnant or declining tax revenues and increased operating costs 

our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have a material adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the global economic recession of 20082009 and subsequent anemic economic recovery period coupled with the lingering effects of the global financial and credit market disruptions have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor these events contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel products weak endmarkets and continued depressed demand resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results in the last three years after reporting record net earnings of 183 billion in 2008 we reported a net loss of 2936 million in 2009 the first in the company’s history in 2010 we returned to profitability reporting net income of 1341 million but the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally while we believe that the longterm prospects for the steel industry remain bright we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in particular steel production in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel currently exceeds chinese demand and in recent years the production growth rate has exceeded the growth rate of demand this rising overcapacity in china has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of lowpriced unfairly traded steel and steel products to the united states that could put our steel products at a competitive disadvantage a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china 

  

competition from other producers imports or alternative materials may have a material adverse effect our business 

we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms domestic and foreign participate in the steel and raw materials markets depending on a variety of factors including raw materials energy labor and capital costs government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as concrete aluminum composites plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

in 2011 automobile producers must begin complying with new corporate average fuel economy “cafe” mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards they may reduce the amount of steel in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further oversupply of steel in north america 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facility in trinidad and acquiring djj in 2008 we still must purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources located throughout the united states although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities purchase prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of our global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors this trade practice creates artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the us market 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004 also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could 

  

temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not applicable across the entire steel market could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our steelmaking processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gasses” “ghgs” and regulation of ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor will be affected both directly and indirectly if congress passes legislation or the united states environmental protection agency “usepa” adopts standards intended to regulate ghg emissions capandtrade legislation designed to curb emissions of ghgs passed in the house of representatives in 2009 but similar legislation failed to pass in the senate in 2010 several states have already adopted and other states may in the future adopt legislation or regulations implementing statewide or in some cases regional capandtrade systems that apply to some or all industries that emit ghgs to the extent that these programs cause an increase in the cost of energy they will have an impact on nucor’s ability to operate in those regions 

the usepa announced in december 2010 a timetable for issuing new rules under the clean air act that will limit ghg emissions from new and refurbished power plants and new oil refineries with target dates of may and november 2012 for adopting final rules rules for existing plants and refineries would be issued by the epa at an unspecified date thereafter if the proposed regulations for power generation are adopted in a form that requires deep reductions in ghg emissions we could incur increased indirect costs to manufacture our products as such regulations would result in an increased cost of the energy primarily electricity which we use extensively in the steelmaking process until all proposed ghg emission regulations are adopted in final form and all legal challenges to them including the authority of the usepa to adopt them have been resolved however we cannot reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition operating performance or ability to compete because some foreign steel producers will not be subject to these same indirect cost increases our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage in addition to increased costs of production we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to ghg regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change 

we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

in addition we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the us which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents natural or manmade disasters acts of terrorism inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

  

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2010 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 261 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 13 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted 

changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results 

because of our international expansion efforts we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates generally each of our foreign operations both produces and sells in its local currency limiting our exposure to foreign currency transactions we monitor our exposures and from time to time may use forward currency contracts to hedge certain forecasted currency transactions in addition to potential transaction losses our reported results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically test our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions if we determine that the fair value of any of these longlived assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet we will incur a noncash impairment loss that will negatively impact our results of operations 

tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the us nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in us tax laws than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws potential changes that would adversely affect us include but are not limited to repealing lifo lastin firstout treatment of inventory and decreasing the ability of us companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the us deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend nucor has been named along with other major steel producers as a codefendant in several related antitrust classaction complaints filed by standard iron works and other steel purchasers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois the plaintiffs allege that from january 2005 to the present eight steel manufacturers including nucor engaged in anticompetitive activities with respect to the production and sale of steel the plaintiffs seek monetary and other relief although we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or estimate the range of nucor’s potential exposure 

in the course of normal compliance evaluation in 2008 at our steel mill in marion ohio we discovered and selfdisclosed to the ohio environmental protection agency the “ohio epa” that the facility had failed to properly permit modifications to its power supply the ohio epa has since issued notices of violation for this incident and ancillary issues arising from it although the initial notice of violation indicated that the ohio epa had not decided whether to seek civil penalties the ohio epa has subsequently informed us that a civil penalty will be assessed we do not believe that the amount of the civil penalty will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

nucor is involved in various other judicial and administrative proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant arising in the ordinary course of business nucor does not believe that any such proceedings including matters relating to contracts torts taxes warranties and insurance will have a material adverse effect on its business operating results financial condition or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2010 24 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 76 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2010 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand nucor utilizes a raw material surcharge as a component of pricing steel to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials in periods of stable demand for our products our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins when demand for and cost of raw materials is lower however the surcharge impacts our sales prices to a lesser extent 

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other 

  

comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2010 accumulated other comprehensive income loss included 689 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2010 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of tax or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk— nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada europe trinidad and australia we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2010 and 2009 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation was incorporated in delaware in 1958 nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products with operating facilities and customers primarily located in north america and increasingly internationally in february 2008 nucor acquired the david j joseph company “djj” and its affiliates through djj nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hot briquetted iron “hbi” and direct reduced iron “dri” supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap additionally the company’s operations include international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary material in producing our products in 2009 we recycled approximately 134 million tons of scrap steel 

segments 

nucor reports its results in the following segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 are set forth in note 22 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2009 annual report which is hereby incorporated by reference 

principal products produced 

principal products from the steel mills segment are hotrolled steel angles rounds flats channels sheet wideflange beams pilings billets blooms beam blanks and plate and coldrolled steel principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems light gauge steel framing steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh the raw materials segment produces dri from nucor’s facility in trinidad brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron hbi and dri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap 

hotrolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap and scrap substitutes utilizing electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist girders fabricated concrete reinforcing steel grating and expanded metal cold drawn wire and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hotrolled steel steel deck light gauge steel framing and wire mesh are manufactured from coldrolled and cold drawn steel 

markets and marketing 

in the steel mills segment hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders in addition other hotrolled and coldrolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained in 2009 approximately 86 of the steel mills segment production was sold to nonaffiliated customers the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment hotrolled steel and coldrolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers throughout the united states and increasingly internationally in 2009 approximately 30 of our sheet steel sales were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale these contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months 

in the steel products segment steel joists and joist girders and steel deck are sold to general contractors and fabricators throughout the united states substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished 

  

   

products are maintained the majority of sales contracts are firm fixedprice contracts and are normally competitively bid against other suppliers longer term contracts may permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs reinforcing products are sold on a construction contract bid basis product applications include highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the united states and canada 

products from the steel mills and steel products segments are marketed mainly through inhouse sales forces the principal competitive factors are price and service the markets that nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions considerable competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports 

in the raw materials segment ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal is processed and sold to domestic and international consumers additionally brokerage of scrap substitutes supply of ferroalloy and transportation material handling and other services are provided to users of scrap metals the primary customers for ferrous scrap are steel mills and foundries that use scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process nonferrous customers include aluminum can companies secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals scrap products and services are marketed through inhouse sales forces in 2009 approximately 18 of the ferrous and nonferrous scrap tons sold by the raw materials segment were to nonaffiliated customers 

additionally the company’s other operations include international trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by nucor mills as well as other steel manufacturers 

due to the global economic crisis that began in the second half of 2008 and continued through 2009 there has been a widespread weakening of global economic conditions resulting in decreased capital spending because of this deterioration the related demand for our products has diminished looking forward into the first quarter of 2010 we believe that steel market conditions will remain extremely challenging one indicator of general economic conditions is the unemployment rate in december 2009 the bureau of labor statistics released the u6 real unemployment rate of 17 the u6 rate includes total unemployed plus workers who want to work full time but are employed part time for economic reasons another indicator of market conditions for our industry is the capacity utilization rate according to the american steel institute industry capacity utilization rates for 2009 were 51 compared to 81 in 2008 and 87 in 2007 as a result we believe that any increased demand in the north american steel markets will be part of a long slow recovery 

we anticipate that global demand in 2010 will bring the steel industry close to production levels experienced prior to the current economic recession with north america and europe trailing behind growth in other parts of the world any sizeable increase in demand in north america will primarily come from replenishing inventory following the destocking that occurred in late 2008 and early 2009 additionally we expect moderate growth in global demand over the next five years primarily related to the continued building of infrastructure in china india and other industrializing nations of the world 

in the midst of this economic crisis nucor has been active in calling on policymakers to enforce global trade agreements and address the jobs crisis in the united states the illegal trade practices of some of our trading partners particularly china continue to be an important concern for the company in mid2008 in response to the global economic crisis china returned to its practice of pegging its currency to the dollar chinese currency manipulation has contributed to huge us trade deficits and the shrinking of our country’s manufacturing base the obama administration has begun to take positive steps toward enforcing trade agreements the commerce secretary and us trade representative have both stated that enforcement of trade agreements is essential the president has also acknowledged the role that the currency policies of our 

  

   

competitors can play in creating competitive disadvantages the administration put this acknowledgement into action when it imposed duties on tires and oil country tubular goods from china during november 2009 

in order to jumpstart economic growth nucor has urged lawmakers to increase spending on our country’s outdated and deteriorating infrastructure according to the american society of civil engineers we need 22 trillion in spending over the next five years to repair and update our infrastructure in order to keep the nation globally competitive the stimulus package passed in early 2009 allocated only 110 billion out of the total 787 billion package for infrastructure of which less than half of the funds allocated to infrastructure have actually been spent at the date of this filing we have also encouraged efforts to replace foreign sources of energy with domesticallyproduced energy as a way to reduce our trade deficit and secure reliable affordable sources of energy traditional and energyrelated infrastructure projects would help create the jobs needed to offset the 84 million jobs lost during this recession 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 155 billion and 142 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 9546 million and 138 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively order backlogs for the steel mills segment include orders attributable to nucor’s downstream businesses the majority of these orders will be filled within one year the decrease in backlog orders in the steel products segments is due to the economic downturn which was particularly severe in the nonresidential construction markets the construction markets represent a significant percentage of sales for our steel mills and steel products segment due to the nature of our raw materials business order backlog within the raw materials segment is not significant 

raw materials 

the primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap which is mostly acquired via djj’s brokerage service from numerous sources throughout the country including our djj scrap processing facilities the primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel which is almost entirely purchased from the steel mills segment in the raw materials segment we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap from the following primary sources i manufacturers and industrial plants or other sources that generate or recycle steel scrap aluminum copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals and ii scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers demolition firms and others who generate steel that they collect from a variety of sources we do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the primary raw material for our dri facility in trinidad is iron ore which is purchased from various international suppliers 

the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used has decreased by 31 from the historically high levels of 438 in 2008 to 303 in 2009 during both years nucor used a raw material surcharge as a component of our product pricing to help offset the impact of volatile scrap prices 

changes in scrap prices are based on changes in the global supply and demand for scrap which is tied to the global supply and demand for steel products from late 2003 until third quarter 2008 demand for scrap and other raw materials rose sharply in response to increased demand both domestically and internationally for a wide range of products made from steel without a corresponding increase in the global supply of those raw materials although steel demand has weakened recently causing a decrease in scrap pricing the surcharge mechanism to offset raw materials pricing changes is still in place our surcharges are based upon changes in widelyavailable market indices for prices of scrap and other raw materials we monitor those changes closely and make adjustments as needed but generally on a monthly basis to the surcharges and sometimes directly to the selling prices for our products the majority of our steel sales are to spot market customers who place their orders each month based on their business needs and our pricing competitiveness compared with both domestic and global 

  

   

producers and trading companies we also include in all of our contracts a method of adjusting prices on a periodic basis to reflect changes in market pricing for scrap contract sales typically have a term ranging from six months to two years there will always be a timing difference between changes in the prices we pay for raw materials and the adjustments we make we attempt to manage the risk associated with this timing difference via the surcharge mechanism which our customers understand is a necessary response by us to the market forces of supply and demand for our raw materials 

nucor’s margins and overall profitability are affected by the global balance of supply and demand for steel we believe our variable cost structure combined with our financial strength and liquidity allowed us to survive the severely depressed steel industry market conditions of 20022003 and 20082009 as scrap prices fell dramatically and our incentive pay system reduced our hourly and salary payroll costs helping to offset lower selling prices we recognize that the steel business is cyclical in nature and expect to see future changes in the balance of supply and demand impact our margins and profitability 

energy consumption 

the steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and natural gas nucor uses cash flow hedges to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process historically us based manufacturers have enjoyed competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on equal footing in what is becoming more and more a global market while we support policies promoting expanded drilling for natural gas our country also needs to pursue the construction of new coalfired and nuclear power plants although our government has prevented access to some of the most promising areas for natural gas exploration continued advances in drilling technology particularly shale gas recovery have resulted in increased proven reserves as a result natural gas prices have been volatile increasing from less than 200 per mmbtu in the 1990’s nymex henryhub pricing to a peak of more than 1500 per mmbtu in december 2005 and then declining beginning in mid2008 to prices below 400 per mmbtu in the summer of 2009 forward contract prices for 2010 are currently averaging less than 600 per mmbtu due to increased reserves the weak economy and reduced industrial demand any form of greenhouse gas legislation is likely to further increase the share of electricity generated by natural gas thereby increasing costs for consumers of electricity nucor actively supports several organizations that are promoting a more rational energy policy we believe this is critical not only for our future business success but also for the future of the us economy supplies of raw materials and energy have been and are expected to be adequate to operate our facilities 

as a carbon steel producer nucor will likely be impacted by legislative and regulatory efforts in the us nucor is also the largest recycler in the us and as such has significantly contributed to the steel industry’s 29 drop in greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions over the last two decades nucor and the rest of the steel industry are continually singled out as already having made the right choices and being models for other industry sectors the growth of nucor has in large part been one of the drivers of this reduction 

at present it appears that legislative efforts directed at climate change are correctly being focused on the negative impact that “cap and trade” type legislation would have on manufacturers and the jobs they represent it is difficult to evaluate the impact of any legislation that at present is only theoretical but it is possible to make some general statements about the overall concept particularly as climate change legislation or regulation would apply to nucor’s cost of operations 

most versions of climate change “cap and trade” legislation treat the steel industry favorably with respect to allowances for emissions that will facilitate production however it is the indirect increased costs for energy resulting from climate change legislation or regulation that are nucor’s primary concern climate change legislation or regulation will have a negative impact on utilities that will result in an increase in the cost of energy that nucor consumes at its operations higher energy costs would make nucor and other us based 

  

   

manufacturers less competitive with other producers in the increasingly global market for steel and steel products for this reason nucor believes it is critical that the us should increase the supply of economical nuclear power and natural gas instead of relying on production of electricity from more expensive alternate sources such as solar and wind 

the severity of the impact on nucor’s operations of increased energy costs will depend upon the specifics of any climate change legislation or regulation for this reason nucor has for some time been actively involved in efforts both internally and externally to improve energy efficiency at all levels of its operations these efforts include participation in climate vision the world steel sector initiative and the asia pacific partnership nucor also tracks energy intensity internally and provides the managers of its various operations with targets for improvement 

the environmental protection agency “epa” has issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking that proposes to regulate ghg’s under the clean air act because most of nucor’s operations are already subject to the epa’s prevention of significant deterioration “psd” and new source review “nsr” rules that were also promulgated under the clean air act complying with any new rules regulating ghg’s should not present significantly new challenges beyond the already cumbersome permitting process the epa’s authority to adopt rules regulating ghg’s has already been challenged in court by several states and the rules themselves when they are adopted will be subject to legal challenges therefore we do not expect the proposed rules regulating ghg’s will be implemented for some time 

strategic growth initiatives 

nucor employs a multipronged growth strategy allowing for flexibility and the ability to capitalize on growth opportunities at any point in time the objective of our strategy is profitable growth that will allow for maximum shareholder returns the four prongs include 

 

  

  

  

 inherent in our growth strategy and our business model is our culture it is a culture based on teamwork continual improvement and longterm strategic thinking over the years our culture and philosophy have enabled us to operate in a downturn the same way we operate during periods of economic strength in fact nucor has a long history of taking advantage of economic downturns to grow stronger and expand our longterm earnings power it is worth noting that a healthy portion of the profits realized for several years leading up until 2009 were generated by assets that we built or acquired during the last economic downturn experienced during the 2001 to 2003 time period these highly successful growth initiatives included our entry into the plate market and the acquisitions of auburn steel birmingham steel and trico steel 

while the current economic downturn presents a number of risks to nucor and the steel industry we also believe that such an environment will present unusually attractive growth opportunities to a company that is in nucor’s position of strength we believe our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach will enable us to capitalize on these opportunities and continue to build nucor into a better and more profitable company well into the future 

optimization of existing operations 

nucor emphasizes optimizing existing operations in order to keep them stateoftheart and globally competitive capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately 400 million in 2010 which is 

  

   

consistent with capital spending levels in 2009 as discussed in further detail below several of our greenfield projects were substantially completed in 2009 including our special bar quality mill in memphis tennessee our castrip ® facility in blytheville arkansas and our galvanizing facility in decatur alabama we began work on a new heat treating facility in hertford county north carolina and on expansion of capacity at our nuiron dri plant in trinidad however the majority of the projected capital expenditures for 2010 will be used to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our existing facilities 

greenfield growth 

we continue to increase our presence in the steel mills segment through greenfield projects such as our special bar quality “sbq” mill in memphis tennessee which has an estimated annual capacity of 850000 tons complementing our mills in south carolina and nebraska the memphis mill positions nucor to provide the most diverse highest quality and lowest cost sbq offering in north america at the start of 2009 we began shipping sbq from the memphis mill to our customers 

another greenfield project is the castrip facility in blytheville arkansas which began production in late 2009 nucor began operations of its other castrip facility in crawfordsville indiana in 2002 these facilities use the breakthrough technology of strip casting to which nucor holds exclusive rights in the united states and brazil strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into near final shape and thickness with minimal hot or cold rolling allowing lower investment and operating costs reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology this process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions we continue to explore potential new joint ventures utilizing the castrip technology 

in november 2009 we commissioned the previously idle kingman arizona rolling mill that we acquired in 2003 operations will begin in the second quarter of 2010 with initial output of straightlength rebar coiled rebar and wire rod slated for production of more than 100000 tons with the ability to increase annual production to 500000 tons also during 2009 we commenced operations at the new galvanizing facility at our sheet mill in decatur alabama the addition of the decatur galvanizing line will increase nucor’s valueadded coated flat rolled products annual capacity by onethird to two million tons per year 

nucor also began construction on a plate heat treating facility at our plate mill in hertford county north carolina the heat treat line will have an estimated annual capacity of 120000 tons and will have the ability to produce heat treated plate from 316” to 2” thick 

we recently began a project to expand the capacity of our nuiron dri production facility in trinidad this project will increase nuiron’s production capacity of highquality iron units the project is expected to be complete in late 2010 the trinidad site benefits from a lowcost supply of natural gas and favorable logistics for receipt of brazilian iron ore and shipment of dri to the us 

in may 2008 nucor applied for a permit to build an ironmaking facility in st james parish louisiana this project has been significantly delayed while we continue working through an extended permitting process and monitor the status of proposed climate change legislation we remain committed to our goal of controlling onethird of our iron inputs via pig iron direct reduced iron or other ironmaking technologies and have several options under development to complement or replace our louisiana blast furnace project if the consequences of climate change legislation makes that project unviable 

acquisitions 

nucor’s acquisitions over the past few years have strengthened our position as north america’s most diversified producer of steel and steel products this diversity has been a significant factor in nucor’s increased 

  

   

profitability through 2008 and added market share across multiple product categories although our acquisition initiatives were put on hold in late 2008 because of the economic crisis we did add to our rebar fabrication footprint with the acquisition of free state steel in 2009 we continue to meet with potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners as we evaluate opportunities in the economic downturn to grow nucor’s longterm earnings power for our shareholders 

the annual capacity of nucor’s downstream valueadded products has more than doubled since late 2006 to over 45 million tons we have done this with our very successful acquisitions of verco manufacturing company in steel decking harris steel group inc in rebar fabrication cold finished bars and metal grating lmp steel  wire company in cold finished bars magnatrax corporation in metal buildings and nelson steel inc in wire mesh harris steel has been a growth platform for nucor over the past three years having completed numerous acquisitions in the months following nucor’s initial acquisition in 2007 with the acquisition of ambassador steel inc in 2008 harris increased our rebar fabrication capacity to over 15 million tons 

in february 2008 nucor announced the acquisition of shv north america corporation which owns 100 of djj and certain affiliates since scrap is our largest single cost this strategic investment provides an ideal growth platform for nucor to expand its direct ownership in the steel scrap supply chain and further our raw materials strategy by the end of 2008 nucor added approximately one million tons of scrap processing and 23 locations via four scrap processing acquisitions executed by djj’s management team although the economy precluded our team from pursuing acquisitions in 2009 we expect to add additional scrap capacity in 2010 nucor’s total scrap processing capacity is now approaching five million tons additionally djj brokers ferrous scrap ferroalloys and nonferrous metals and internationally sources scrap pig iron and scrap substitutes the djj mill and industrial services business provides logistics and metallurgical blending operations and offers onsite handling and trading of industrial scrap the djj rail services business oversees a large private fleet of rail cars dedicated to scrap movement and offers complete railcar fleet management and leases for third parties all of these businesses have strategic value to nucor as the most diversified north american steel producer 

international growth 

in 2008 nucor opened a european office and entered into a joint investment with duferco s a in july 2008 nucor acquired a 50 equity interest in duferdofin nucor srl for approximately 6713 million including 43 million paid in 2009 as an adjustment to the purchase price duferdofin nucor operates a one million tonperyear steel melt shop with a bloombillet caster in brescia italy the company also operates four rolling mills located throughout italy—two beam mills one track shoescutting edges mill and a new merchantrebar mill the rolling mill capacities include 1 million metric tons for beams 55000 metric tons for track shoescutting edges and 450000 metric tons for bar the new merchantrebar mill was commissioned in late 2009 duferdofin nucor’s customers are primarily steel service centers and distributors located in italy southern europe and north africa 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff only 90 employees are located in our executive office the majority of nucor’s 20400 employees are not represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the current global recession and credit crisis have and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business 

the current deep and potentially prolonged global recession that officially began in the united states in december 2007 has since the third quarter of 2008 had a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows a continued recession both globally and in the united states or the public perception that a recession is continuing could continue to depress demand for our products and adversely affect our business 

since the financial and credit crisis began the us government and the federal reserve bank have created a number of programs that have helped to stabilize credit markets and financial institutions and restore liquidity despite these efforts there can be no assurance that these programs individually or collectively will continue to have beneficial effects on the markets overall or will resolve the credit or liquidity issues of companies that participate in the programs although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities this current crisis could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility the recession is also making it difficult or in many cases impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations their lack of or limited access to capital would adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or in some cases to pay for our products on a timely basis 

our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy appliance and automotive as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the current global economic recession coupled with the continued global financial and credit market disruptions have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor these events have contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel products weak endmarkets and continued depressed demand all resulting in historic volatility in our financial results year over year nucor reported record high earnings of 183 billion in 2008 and recorded the company’s first net loss of 294 million in 2009 while nucor believes that the longterm prospects for steel remain bright the company is unable to predict the duration or severity of the current global recession future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products particularly during periods of global recession this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant 

  

   

amounts of steel and steel products at prices below their cost of production these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of lowpriced unfairly traded steel and steel products to the united states in recent years capacity growth in china has significantly exceeded the growth in chinese market demand a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although nucor has vertically integrated its business through our dri facility in trinidad and through the acquisition of djj we are still required to purchase most of our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources throughout the country although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities purchase prices of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004 also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather and political and economic factors beyond our control disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our steel making processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gasses” and pending legislation or regulation of ghg’s if enacted or adopted in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

carbon is an essential raw material in nucor’s production processes as a carbon steel producer nucor will be affected both directly and indirectly if proposed climate change legislation such as use of a “cap and trade” 

  

   

policy is enacted into law or alternatively regulations intended to reduce ghg emissions are adopted by the epa the impact of legislation and regulations on nucor and its suppliers and customers will depend on a number of factors including whether ghg sources in multiple sectors of the economy are regulated the overall ghg emissions cap level the degree to which ghg offsets are allowed the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources and the indirect impact of carbon regulation on electricity and natural gas prices if such legislation is enacted or regulations are adopted we could incur increased energy environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition operating performance or ability to compete we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change 

we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

in addition we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the us which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies 

competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect our business 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites glass plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

congress has raised the corporate average fuel economy “cafe” mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks produced beginning in 2011 automobile producers may reduce the steel content of cars and trucks to help achieve the new cafe fuel economy standards reducing demand for steel and resulting in an oversupply in north america 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2009 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 260 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally 

  

   

generated funds or from borrowings under our 13 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted 

changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results 

some of our steel products and other subsidiaries conduct their business in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting their results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate to fewer us dollars a strong us dollar also hampers our international trading and distribution business weak local currencies limit the amount of us dollar denominated products that we can import for our international operations and limits our ability to be competitive against local producers selling in local currencies 

the accounting treatment of equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our equity method investments goodwill and other longlived assets to test for impairment the results of this calculation may be affected by the current adverse market conditions for the steel industry as well as interest rates and general economic conditions if impairment is determined to exist we will incur noncash impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results 

the steel industry and specifically nucor’s business is sensitive to changes in taxes as a company based in the us nucor is more exposed to the effects of the various forms of tax increases in the us than some of our major competitors our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations such as certain provisions in the current administration’s budget proposals and various tax changes under discussion in congress the proposals with potential adverse effect include but are not limited to repealing lifo lastin firstout treatment of inventory and decreasing the ability of us companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the us deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend nucor has been named along with other major steel producers as a codefendant in several related antitrust classaction complaints filed by standard iron works and other steel purchasers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois the plaintiffs allege that from january 2005 to the present eight steel manufacturers including nucor engaged in anticompetitive activities with respect to the production and sale of steel the plaintiffs seek monetary and other relief although we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or determine nucor’s potential exposure 

nucor is involved in various other judicial and administrative proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant arising in the ordinary course of business nucor does not believe that any such proceedings including matters relating to contracts torts taxes warranties and insurance will have a material adverse effect on its business operating results financial condition or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2009 14 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 86 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2009 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand nucor has a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials due to decreased demand for and cost of raw materials however the surcharge is impacting our sales prices to a lesser extent than in prior years 

through the first three quarters of 2009 our earnings were negatively impacted from accelerated consumption of highcost iron units purchased prior to the abrupt downturn in economic activity late in 2008 since pig iron has purchase lead times of four to six months from ordering to delivery dramatically and rapidly reduced sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2008 and through much of 2009 resulted in the accumulation of increased tons of pig iron inventories primarily at our steel mills ordered at peak market prices as of the end of the third quarter of 2009 we had completed the usage of those high cost iron units the impact on 2009 net 

  

   

earnings of the high priced raw material inventory overhang was approximately 4200 million or 085 per share after taxes as a result we experienced significant improvement in our raw material costs during the fourth quarter of 2009 and expect to continue to see improved margins in 2010 

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2009 accumulated other comprehensive income loss included 741 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax income of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2009 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of tax or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk —nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada and trinidad and its joint ventures in australia and italy we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2009 and 2008 were insignificant

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation was incorporated in delaware in 1958 nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products with operating facilities and customers primarily located in north america in february 2008 nucor acquired the david j joseph company “djj” and its affiliates through djj nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron and hbidri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary material in producing our products in 2008 we recycled approximately 20 million tons of scrap steel 

segments 

nucor reports its results in the following segments steel mills steel products and raw materials net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense amortization expense earnings before income taxes assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 as well as geographic information for the two years ended december 31 2008 are set forth in note 22 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2008 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference 

principal products produced 

principal products from the steel mills segment are hotrolled steel angles rounds flats channels sheet wideflange beams pilings billets blooms beam blanks and plate and coldrolled steel principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems light gauge steel framing steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh the raw materials segment produces direct reduced iron “dri” from nucor’s facility in trinidad brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals pig iron and hbidri supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap 

hotrolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap and scrap substitutes utilizing electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist girders fabricated concrete reinforcing steel grating and expanded metal cold drawn wire and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hotrolled steel steel deck light gauge steel framing and wire mesh are manufactured from coldrolled and cold drawn steel 

markets and marketing 

in the steel mills segment hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders in addition other hotrolled and coldrolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained in 2008 approximately 89 of the steel mills segment production was sold to nonaffiliated customers the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment hotrolled steel and coldrolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers throughout the united states in 2008 approximately 40 of our sheet steel sales were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale these contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months 

in the steel products segment steel joists and joist girders and steel deck are sold to general contractors and fabricators throughout the united states substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained the majority of sales contracts are firm fixedprice contracts and are normally competitively bid against other suppliers longer term contracts may permit price adjustments to reflect changes 

  

   

in prevailing raw materials costs reinforcing products are sold on a construction contract bid basis product applications include highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the united states and canada 

products from the steel mills and steel products segments are marketed mainly through inhouse sales forces the principal competitive factors are price and service the markets that nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions considerable competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports 

in the raw materials segment ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal is processed and sold to domestic and international consumers additionally brokerage of scrap substitutes supply of ferroalloy and transportation material handling and other services are provided to users of scrap metals the primary customers for ferrous scrap are steel mills and foundries that use scrap as a raw material in their manufacturing process nonferrous customers include aluminum can companies secondary aluminum smelters steel mills and other processors and consumers of various nonferrous metals scrap products and services are marketed through inhouse sales forces in 2008 approximately 20 of the ferrous and nonferrous scrap tons sold by the raw materials segment were to nonaffiliated customers 

due to the global liquidity crisis that has resulted in the rapid weakening of global economic stability capital spending and the related demand for our products remains depressed in response the united states congress has recently enacted economic stimulus legislation that includes funds for infrastructure that should help capital spending in the months and years to come this spending package includes “buy america” language that should benefit our industry the timing of this stimulus spending is uncertain however and we are preparing for a long period of depressed demand 

in the past unfairly traded steel imports have had a devastating effect on the us steel industry and its workers we have continued the aggressive trade case work in which we have engaged over the years with our participation in the current statutory fiveyear sunset reviews of existing duties in late 2006 the united states international trade commission chose to remove the duties that were in place on many of the countries involved in dumping these products into the united states as a result more foreign steel has continued to enter our borders with negative effects on several segments of the steel industry the current economic crisis brings with it a renewed concern that illegally traded steel will once again become a major issue in our market the world’s most open trading market the past history of illegally traded steel imports has forced nucor to become a realist regarding global trade we will continue to fight illegally dumped foreign steel in support of both free and fair trade 

in 2008 nucor aggressively supported the adoption of a chinese currency bill that would identify the mercantilist practices of currency manipulation that result in distorted trade an insurmountable trade deficit and the loss of manufacturing jobs in the united states several bills were generated in the house and senate but none were enacted into law our coalition supporting these bills was broad reaching across multiple industries and ultimately drew attention to the domestic manufacturing job loss issue in 2009 we hope that newly proposed legislation will unite congress in an effort to maintain and enforce laws ensuring free and fair trade the current treasury secretary has said informally that china manipulates its currency this is a more positive step than anything accomplished by the prior administration nucor actively supports several organizations that promote free and fair trade and oppose currency manipulation 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 142 billion and 274 billion at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was 

  

   

approximately 138 billion and 151 billion at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively order backlogs for the steel mills segment include orders attributable to nucor’s downstream businesses the majority of these orders will be filled within one year the decrease in backlog orders in both segments is due to the economic downturn that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and has continued into 2009 this downturn is severe in the construction markets which represent a significant percentage of sales for our steel mills and steel products segment due to the nature of our raw materials business order backlog within the raw materials segment is not significant 

raw materials 

the primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap which is primarily acquired via djj’s brokerage service from numerous sources throughout the country including our djj scrap processing facilities the primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel which is almost entirely purchased from the steel mills segment in the raw materials segment we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap from the following primary sources i manufacturers and industrial plants or other sources which generate or recycle steel scrap aluminum copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals and ii scrap dealers peddlers auto wreckers demolition firms and others who generate steel which they collect from a variety of sources we do not purchase a material amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources the primary raw material for our dri facility in trinidad is iron ore which is purchased from various international suppliers 

the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used remained at historically high levels in 2007 and 2008 increasing 13 from 246 in 2006 to 278 in 2007 and increasing an additional 58 to 438 in 2008 during both years nucor used a raw material surcharge as a component of our product pricing to help offset the impact of volatile scrap prices 

changes in scrap prices are based on changes in the global supply and demand for scrap which is tied to the global supply and demand for steel products from late 2003 until third quarter 2008 demand for scrap and other raw materials rose sharply in response to increased demand both domestically and internationally for a wide range of products made from steel without a corresponding increase in the global supply of those raw materials our surcharges are based upon changes in widelyavailable market indices for prices of scrap and other raw materials we monitor those changes closely and make adjustments as needed but generally on a monthly basis to the surcharges and sometimes directly to the selling prices for our products the majority of our steel sales are to spot market customers who place their orders each month based on their business needs and our pricing competitiveness compared with both domestic and global producers and trading companies we also include in all of our contracts a method of adjusting prices on a monthly basis to reflect changes in scrap prices contract sales typically have a term ranging from six months to two years although there will always be a timing difference between changes in the prices we pay for raw materials and the adjustments we make we believe that the surcharge mechanism which our customers understand is a necessary response by us to the market forces of supply and demand for our raw materials has until recently been an effective means of maintaining our margins 

in the fourth quarter nucor experienced a rapid falloff in sales due to weaker market conditions since pig iron and certain grades of scrap have lead times of four to six months dramatically reduced sales volumes resulted in the accumulation of increased tons of inventories primarily at our steel mills ordered at peak market prices our margins will be reduced until we work through this high priced inventory 

nucor’s margins and overall profitability are affected by the global balance of supply and demand for steel our margins have been much stronger since 2002 and 2003 when most domestic and global steel companies reported operating losses and many filed for bankruptcy we believe our variable cost structure allowed us to survive those severely depressed market conditions as scrap prices fell dramatically and our incentive pay system reduced our hourly and salary payroll costs helping to offset lower selling prices we recognize that the steel business is cyclical in nature and expect to see future changes in the balance of supply and demand impact our 

  

   

margins and profitability we also recognize that the global demand for steel has been growing at close to 6 annually since 2000 reflecting the building of infrastructure in brazil russia india china the middle east eastern europe africa and other parts of asia we believe this growth in steel consumption is likely to resume once the global economy emerges from the current severe recession 

the steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and natural gas nucor uses cash flow hedges and natural gas purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process historically usbased manufacturers have enjoyed competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on equal footing in what is becoming more and more a global market in recent decades our government has allowed a growing overreliance on natural gas for the generation of electricity while delaying or halting the construction of new coalfired and nuclear power plants at the same time our government has prevented access to some of the most promising areas for natural gas exploration as a result natural gas prices have increased from less than 200 per mmbtu in the 1990’s nymex henryhub pricing to a peak of more than 1500 per mmbtu in december 2005 forward contract prices for 2009 are currently averaging less than 500 per mmbtu due to the weak economy and reduced industrial demand any form of greenhouse gas legislation is likely to further increase the share of electricity generated by natural gas thereby increasing costs for consumers of electricity nucor actively supports several organizations that are promoting a more rational energy policy we believe this is critical for not only our future business success but also for the future of the us economy supplies of raw materials and energy have been and are expected to be adequate to operate our facilities 

strategic growth initiatives 

nucor employs a multipronged growth strategy allowing for flexibility and the ability to capitalize on growth opportunities at any point in time the objective of our strategy is profitable growth that will allow for maximum shareholder returns the four prongs include 

 

  

  

  

 inherent in our growth strategy and our business model is our culture it is a culture based on teamwork continual improvement and longterm strategic thinking over the years our culture and philosophy have enabled us to operate during periods of economic strength the same way we operate in a downturn in fact nucor has a long history of taking advantage of economic downturns to grow stronger and expand our longterm earnings power it is worth noting that a healthy portion of the profits realized over the past five years have been generated by assets we built or acquired during the last economic downturn experienced during the 2001 to 2003 time period these highly successful growth initiatives included our entry into the plate market and the acquisitions of auburn steel birmingham steel and trico steel 

while the current economic downturn presents a number of risks to nucor and the steel industry we also believe that such an environment will present unusually attractive growth opportunities to a company that is in nucor’s position of strength we believe our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach will enable us to capitalize on these opportunities and continue to build nucor into a better and more profitable company well into the future 

optimization of existing operations 

nucor emphasizes optimizing existing operations in order to keep them stateoftheart and globally competitive capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately 400 million in 2009 a decrease of 

  

   

approximately 61 from 2008 this decrease is in part due to the substantial completion of several of our greenfield projects and also reflects the weakened business conditions resulting from the us financial crisis of late 2008 the majority of the projected capital expenditures for 2009 will be used to maintain the productivity and efficiency of our existing facilities 

greenfield growth 

we continue to increase our presence in the steel mills segment through greenfield projects such as our special bar quality “sbq” mill in memphis tennessee which has an estimated annual capacity of 850000 tons complementing our mills in south carolina and nebraska the memphis mill positions nucor to provide the most diverse highest quality and lowest cost sbq offering in north america production startup began in the second half of 2008 

another greenfield project is the castrip ® facility under construction in blytheville arkansas nucor began operations of its 100 owned castrip facility in crawfordsville indiana in 2002 this facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting to which nucor holds exclusive rights in the united states and brazil strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling allowing lower investment and operating costs reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology this process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions the arkansas castrip facility is expected to begin operating in the first half of 2009 we continue to explore potential new joint ventures utilizing the castrip technology 

in 2008 we announced the opening of the previously idle kingman arizona rolling mill that we acquired in 2003 with operations ready to begin in the second quarter of 2009 subject to market conditions at that time during the year we substantially completed the construction of a galvanizing facility at our sheet mill in decatur alabama and commenced operations at our building systems plant in brigham city utah nucor has also announced plans to install a plate heat treating facility at our plate mill in hertford county north carolina the heat treat line will have an estimated annual capacity of 120000 tons and will have the ability to produce heat treated plate from 316 “through 2” thick production startup is expected to begin in the second half of 2010 

in may 2008 nucor applied for a permit to build a stateoftheart ironmaking facility in st james parish louisiana sites outside of the united states are still being considered and the site selection and capital investment are subject to approval by nucor’s board of directors when completed the first phase of the facility is expected to produce three million tons of pig iron employing the latest technologies to reduce emissions if the project is ultimately built in the us it would be the first domestic greenfield pig iron facility built in more than 30 years 

acquisitions 

nucor’s acquisitions over the past few years have strengthened our position as north america’s most diversified producer of steel and steel products this diversity has been a significant factor in nucor’s increased profitability and added market share across multiple product categories 

the annual capacity of nucor’s downstream valueadded products has more than doubled since late 2006 to over 45 million tons we have done this with our very successful acquisitions of verco manufacturing company in steel decking harris steel group inc in rebar fabrication cold finished bars and metal grating lmp steel  wire company in cold finished bars magnatrax corporation in metal buildings and nelson steel inc in wire mesh harris steel continued to be a growth platform for nucor in 2008 having completed numerous acquisitions in the months following nucor’s initial acquisition in 2007 with the acquisition of ambassador steel inc in 2008 harris increased our rebar fabrication capacity to over 15 million tons 

  

   

in february 2008 nucor announced the acquisition of shv north america corporation which owns 100 of djj and certain affiliates since scrap is our largest single cost this strategic investment provides an ideal growth platform for nucor to expand its direct ownership in the steel scrap supply chain and further our raw materials strategy by the end of 2008 nucor added approximately one million tons of scrap processing and 23 locations via four scrap processing acquisitions executed by djj’s management team nucor’s total scrap processing capacity is now approaching five million tons additionally djj brokers ferrous scrap ferroalloys and nonferrous metals and internationally sources scrap pig iron and scrap substitutes the djj mill and industrial services business provides logistics and metallurgical blending operations and offers onsite handling and trading of industrial scrap the djj rail services business oversees a large private fleet of rail cars dedicated to scrap movement and offers complete railcar fleet management and leases for third parties all of these businesses have strategic value to nucor as the most diversified north american steel producer 

international growth 

in 2008 nucor established an international growth platform by opening a european office and executing a jointventure investment with duferco s a in july 2008 nucor acquired 50 of the stock of duferdofin—nucor srl duferdofin—nucor operates a steel melting and bloombillet caster in san zeno italy as well as rolling mills in pallanzeno in the piedmont region and giammoro in sicily a new merchant bar mill is under construction at the giammoro plant and is expected to be fully operational by mid2009 the new mill at the giammoro plant is expected to produce approximately 450000 metric tons the new company also includes the distribution companies of the former duferdofin enabling duferdofin—nucor to supply steel across southern europe and north africa 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff only 85 employees are located in our executive offices the majority of nucor’s 21700 employees are not represented by labor unions

 many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors continued tableend   

the current global recession and credit crisis have and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business 

the current deep and potentially prolonged global recession that officially began in the united states in december 2007 has since the beginning of the third quarter of 2008 had a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows in midfebruary 2009 the federal reserve warned that the united states economy faces an “unusually gradual and prolonged” period of recovery from this deep and recessionary period 

the financial and credit crisis that intensified the current recession also triggered a period of upheaval characterized by bankruptcy failure collapse or sale at nominal amounts of various financial institutions despite the unprecedented level of intervention in the credit markets by the us and foreign governments that has already occurred and is likely to continue to occur this crisis could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility the financial and credit crisis is also making in difficult or in many cases impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations their lack of or limited access to capital adversely affects their ability to purchase our products or in some cases to pay for our products on a timely basis 

our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows because steel producers generally have high fixed costs reduced volumes result in operating inefficiencies over the sixyear period ended december 31 2008 our net earnings have varied from a record high of 183 billion in 2008 to a low of 648 million in 2003 future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products particularly during periods of global recession this excess capacity results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices below their cost of production these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of lowpriced unfairly traded steel and steel products to the united states in recent years capacity growth in china has significantly exceeded the growth in chinese market demand a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in china increasing steel exports 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products although nucor has vertically integrated its business through the successful startup of our dri facility in trinidad and through the acquisition of djj we may still be required to purchase our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous other sources throughout 

  

   

the country although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities purchase prices of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004 also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather and political and economic factors beyond our control disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our steel making processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our customers and suppliers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gasses” ghg’s 

in 2008 several bills were introduced but not passed in the united states senate that would regulate ghg and carbon dioxide emissions similar bills will be introduced in 2009 this legislation when adopted will increase our energy and other operating costs this proposed legislation regulates domestic production but excludes imports from the same standards for a period of eight years which will make domestic manufacturing uncompetitive with imported products during this time these increased costs could also encourage more of our customers to relocate their manufacturing facilities to foreign countries that do not regulate ghg emissions and where nucor is not positioned to sell or distribute our products this proposed legislation is also likely to increase energy costs for all us consumers resulting in a weaker domestic economy 

we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

in addition we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the us which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies 

  

   

competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect our business 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites glass plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products 

congress has raised the corporate average fuel economy “cafe” mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks produced beginning in 2011 automobile producers may reduce the steel content of cars and trucks to achieve the new cafe fuel economy standards reducing demand for steel and resulting in an oversupply in north america 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2008 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 250 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 13 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive steel products are not required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted 

changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results 

some of our steel products and other subsidiaries conduct their business in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting their results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate to fewer us dollars 

the accounting treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment the results of this calculation may be affected by the current adverse market conditions for the steel industry as well as interest rates and general economic conditions if impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend nucor has been named along with other major steel producers as a codefendant in several related antitrust classaction complaints filed by standard iron works and other steel purchasers in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois the cases are filed as class actions the plaintiffs allege that from january 2005 to the present eight steel manufacturers including nucor engaged in anticompetitive activities with respect to the production and sale of steel the plaintiffs seek monetary and other relief although we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and will vigorously defend against them we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or determine nucor’s potential exposure 

nucor is involved in various other judicial and administrative proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant arising in the ordinary course of business nucor does not believe that any such proceedings including matters relating to contracts torts taxes warranties and insurance will have a material adverse effect on its business operating results financial condition or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2008 14 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 86 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2008 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel other ferrous and nonferrous metals alloys and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand nucor has a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials 

as a result of the rapid falloff in sales due to weaker market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 we are beginning 2009 with high inventories of more expensive scrap and scrap substitutes since pig iron and certain grades of scrap have lead times of four to six months dramatically reduced sales volumes resulted in the accumulation of increased tons of inventories ordered at peak market prices if market conditions remain depressed for a prolonged period it will take longer for us to work through these expensive raw materials primarily pig iron at our sheet mills 

  

   

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our aluminum and copper purchases and sales gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2008 accumulated other comprehensive income loss includes 660 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period the following table presents the negative effect on pretax income of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31 2008 due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands 

 

 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of tax or recognized in net earnings as appropriate these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 

foreign currency risk —nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada and trinidad and its joint ventures in australia and italy in the first half of 2008 the company entered into forward foreign currency contracts in order to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuation on the anticipated joint venture with the duferco group of lugano switzerland these contracts had a notional value of €4235 million and matured in the second quarter of 2008 resulting in gains of 176 million these contracts all settled during the second quarter of 2008

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation was incorporated in delaware in 1958 the business of nucor corporation and its subsidiaries is the manufacture and sale of steel and steel products which accounted for the majority of the sales and earnings in 2007 2006 and 2005 the earnings in 2005 include other income of 92 million in settlement of claims against third parties related to environmental matters 

nucor is north america’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary material in producing our products in 2007 we recycled approximately 21 million tons of scrap steel 

segments 

nucor reports its results in the following segments steel mills and steel products net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense earnings before income taxes assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 as well as geographic information for the two years ended december 31 2007 are set forth in note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2007 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference 

principal products produced 

principal products from the steel mills segment are hotrolled steel angles rounds flats channels sheet wideflange beams pilings billets blooms beam blanks and plate and coldrolled steel principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders steel deck fabricated concrete reinforcing steel cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems light gauge steel framing steel grating and expanded metal and wire and wire mesh hotrolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap utilizing electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist girders fabricated concrete reinforcing steel grating and expanded metal cold drawn wire and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hotrolled steel steel deck light gauge steel framing and wire mesh are manufactured from coldrolled and cold drawn steel 

markets and marketing 

in the steel mills segment hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders in addition other hotrolled and coldrolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained in 2007 approximately 92 of the steel mills segment production was sold to nonaffiliated customers the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment hotrolled steel and coldrolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers throughout the united states in 2007 approximately 50 of our sheet steel sales were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale these contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months 

in the steel products segment steel joists and joist girders and steel deck are sold to general contractors and fabricators throughout the united states substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained the majority of sales contracts are firm fixedprice contracts and are normally competitively bid against other suppliers longer term contracts may permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw materials costs reinforcing products are sold on a construction contract bid basis product applications include highways bridges reservoirs utilities hospitals schools airports stadiums and highrise buildings cold finished steel steel fasteners steel grating wire and wire mesh are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the united states and canada 

  

   

products from both segments are marketed mainly through inhouse sales forces the principal competitive factors are price and service the markets that nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions considerable competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports unfairly traded steel imports have devastated the us steel industry and its workers we have continued the aggressive trade case work in which we have engaged over the years with our participation in the current statutory fiveyear sunset reviews of existing duties in late 2006 the united states international trade commission chose to remove the duties that were in place on many of the countries involved in dumping these products into the united states as a result more foreign steel may continue to enter our borders with negative effects on our business we will continue to fight illegally dumped foreign steel in support of free and fair trade through the legal process in 2007 nucor aggressively supported the adoption of a chinese currency bill that would identify the mercantilist practices of currency manipulation that result in distorted trade an insurmountable trade deficit and the loss of manufacturing jobs in the united states several bills were generated in the house and senate but none were put into law our effort was broad reaching across multiple industries and ultimately drew attention to the domestic manufacturing job loss issue in 2008 we hope that newly proposed legislation will unite congress in an effort to maintain and enforce laws ensuring free and fair trade nucor actively supports several organizations that promote free and fair trade and that oppose currency manipulation 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucors backlog of orders was approximately 274 billion and 252 billion at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively nucors backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 151 billion and 5724 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase in backlog of orders is due to the numerous acquisitions in the steel products segment in 2007 the majority of these orders will be filled within one year 

raw materials 

the primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap which is acquired from numerous sources throughout the country with the escalation of scrap steel prices in 2003 and 2004 years in which prices increased 25 and 74 respectively nucor successfully implemented a raw material sales price surcharge in 2004 this surcharge has helped offset the impact of significantly more volatile scrap prices and allowed us to purchase the scrap needed to fill our customers’ orders the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton remained at historically high levels in 2006 and 2007 increasing slightly from 244 per ton in 2005 to 246 per ton in 2006 and increasing 13 to 278 in 2007 the primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel which is almost entirely purchased from the steel mills segment 

the steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and natural gas nucor uses cash flow hedges and natural gas purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process historically usbased manufacturers have enjoyed competitive energy costs that have allowed them to compete on equal footing in what is becoming more and more a global market in recent decades our government has allowed a growing overreliance on natural gas for the generation of electricity while delaying or halting the construction of new coalfired and nuclear power plants at the same time our government has prevented access to some of the most promising areas for natural gas exploration as a result natural gas prices have increased from less than 200 per mmbtu in the 1990’s nymex henryhub pricing to a peak of more than 1500 per mmbtu in december 2005 and to a calendar 2008 average price currently exceeding 800 per mmbtu since an increasing share of electricity is now generated using natural gas higher natural gas prices are also increasing costs for consumers of electricity nucor actively supports several organizations that are promoting a more rational energy policy we believe this is critical for not only our future business success but also for the future of the us economy supplies of raw materials and energy have been and are expected to be adequate to operate our facilities 

  

   

strategy 

nucor has historically focused on greenfield growth and on optimizing existing operations in order to keep them stateoftheart and globally competitive capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately 800 million in 2008 an increase of more than 50 from 2007 while more than 300 million of the 2008 capital spending is allocated to our greenfield projects the remainder is an estimate of what we will spend to maintain the productivity and efficiency of our existing facilities in recent years our focus has expanded to include growing profitably through acquisitions and through joint ventures that leverage new technologies 

recent acquisitions joint ventures and greenfield projects 

nucor’s acquisitions over the past few years have strengthened our position as north america’s most diversified producer of steel and steel products this diversity has been a significant factor in nucor’s profitability 

the annual capacity of nucor’s downstream valueadded products has more than doubled since late 2006 to just under four million tons we have done this with our very successful acquisitions of verco manufacturing company in steel decking harris steel group inc in rebar fabrication cold finished bars and metal grating lmp steel  wire company in cold finished bars magnatrax corporation in metal buildings and nelson steel inc in wire mesh we are looking forward to growing the already strong returns generated by these businesses 

we continue to increase our presence in the steel mills segment through greenfield projects such as our special bar quality “sbq” mill in memphis tennessee which will have an estimated annual capacity of 850000 tons complementing our mills in south carolina and nebraska the memphis mill positions nucor to provide the most diverse highest quality and lowest cost sbq offering in north america we are encouraged by the strong level of marketplace interest in what memphis will be able to provide our customers production startup is on schedule for the second quarter of this year 

another greenfield project is the castrip ® facility under construction in blytheville arkansas nucor began operations of its 100 owned castrip facility in crawfordsville indiana in 2002 this facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting to which nucor holds exclusive rights in the united states and brazil strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling allowing lower investment and operating costs reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology this process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions in 2007 the castrip facility in indiana continued setting monthly production and shipping records in 2005 we selected blytheville arkansas as the location for our second castrip production facility the arkansas castrip facility is expected to begin operating in the second half of 2008 we continue to explore potential new joint ventures utilizing the castrip technology 

raw materials projects 

recently we expanded our vertical integration strategy to include upstream control of raw materials nucor’s raw materials strategy includes the goal of controlling approximately 6000000 to 7000000 tons per year of high quality scrap substitutes for consumption by the steel mills 

implementation of nucor’s raw materials strategy is off to an excellent start with 2007’s very successful startup of nuiron unlimited our direct reduced iron “dri” plant in trinidad in its startup year nuiron established itself as one of the world’s most productive dri facilities producing over 14 million metric tons of dri we expect to produce 18 million metric tons in 2008 and the nuiron team is working on plans to expand this capacity the trinidad site benefits from a low cost supply of natural gas under a longterm contract and from favorable logistics for receipt of brazilian iron ore and shipment of dri to the united states 

  

   

in 2002 nucor entered a joint venture with the rio tinto group mitsubishi corporation and chinese steelmaker shougang corporation to construct a commercial hismelt ® plant in kwinana western australia the hismelt process converts iron ore fines and coal fines directly to liquid metal eliminating the need for a blast furnace sinterpellet plants and coke ovens additionally the hismelt technology offers an alternative supply of highquality iron units as a scrap substitute nucor has a 25 interest in the joint venture that owns the hismelt commercial plant construction was completed and the startup of operations began in 2005 this plant has an initial annual capacity of 800000 metric tons which is expandable to over 1500000 metric tons 

in february 2008 nucor announced the acquisition of shv north america corporation which owns 100 of the david j joseph company “djj” and certain affiliates for a cash purchase price of approximately 144 billion since scrap is our largest single cost this strategic investment provides an ideal growth platform for nucor to expand its direct ownership in the steel scrap supply chain and further its raw materials strategy djj operates over 30 scrap processing facilities with an annual capacity to process 35 million tons of ferrous scrap additionally djj brokers over 20 million tons of ferrous scrap internationally sources scrap pig iron and scrap substitutes and brokers ferroalloys and over one half billion pounds of nonferrous metals the djj mill and industrial services business provides logistics and metallurgical blending operations and offers onsite handling and trading of industrial scrap the djj rail services business oversees the largest private fleet of rail cars dedicated to scrap movement and offers complete railcar fleet management and leases for third parties all of these businesses have strategic value to nucor as the most diversified north american steel producer we expect this acquisition to be completed in the first quarter of 2008 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff only 80 employees are located in our executive offices the majority of nucors 18000 employees are engaged in its steel mills and steel products businesses and are not represented by labor unions

 many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors continued tableend   

our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows because steel producers generally have high fixed costs reduced volumes result in operating inefficiencies over the fiveyear period ended december 31 2007 our net earnings have varied from a high of 176 billion in 2006 to a low of 648 million in 2003 future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products this excess capacity results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices below their cost of production these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of lowpriced unfairly traded steel and steel products to the united states in recent years capacity growth in china has significantly exceeded the growth in chinese market demand a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in china increasing steel exports 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products we acquire our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous sources throughout the country although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities purchase prices of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility and growing scrap exports to satisfy the scrap demand of global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004 also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather and political and economic factors beyond our control disruptions in the supply of 

  

   

our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our steel making processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our customers and suppliers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gasses” ghg’s 

in 2007 several bills were introduced in the united states senate that would regulate ghg and carbon dioxide emissions this legislation when adopted will increase our energy and other operating costs this legislation regulates domestic production but excludes imports from the same standards for a period of eight years which will make domestic manufacturing uncompetitive with imported products during this time these increased costs could also encourage more of our customers to relocate their manufacturing facilities to foreign countries that do not regulate ghg emissions and where nucor is not positioned to sell or distribute our products this legislation is also likely to increase energy costs for all us consumers resulting in a weaker domestic economy 

we plan to continue to implement acquisition strategies and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these businesses with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

in addition we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the us which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies 

competition from other materials may materially adversely affect our business 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites glass plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could materially adversely affect prices and demand for our steel products 

congress has recently raised the corporate average fuel economy “cafe” mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks produced beginning in 2011 automobile producers may reduce the steel content of cars and trucks to achieve the new cafe fuel economy standards reducing demand for steel and resulting in an oversupply in north america 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2007 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 169 billion our business also requires substantial 

  

   

expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive steel products are not required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted 

changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results 

some of our steel products and other subsidiaries conduct their business in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting their results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate to fewer us dollars 

the accounting treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets could result in future asset impairments which would reduce our earnings 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by the market conditions noted above as well as interest rates and general economic conditions if impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities tableend nucor has increased its base cash dividend every year since the company began paying dividends in 1973 in 2007 in addition to increasing the base dividend the board of directors approved a supplemental dividend based on nucor’s strong performance during the year as a result nucor paid a total dividend of 243 per share in 2007 compared with 188 per share in 2006 in february 2008 the board of directors approved a 7 increase in nucor’s quarterly base dividend to 032 per share and announced a supplemental dividend of 020 per share for a total quarterly dividend of 052 per share the payment of any future supplemental dividends depends on nucor’s earnings cash flows and financial position during the balance of the current year all of which could be adversely affected by many factors including many over which the company has little or no control see the discussion of the factors that affect nucor’s business and operations and involve risk and uncertainty in item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

additional information regarding the market for nucor’s common stock quarterly market price ranges the number of stockholders and dividend payments is incorporated by reference to nucor’s 2007 annual report page 62

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2007 19 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 81 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2007 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand nucor has a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins 

  

   

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process when management believes it is prudent to do so gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2007 accumulated other comprehensive income loss includes 40 million in unrealized netoftax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments a sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10 and 25 in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by 325 million and 813 million respectively any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax because these instruments are structured and used as hedges these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle 

foreign currency risk —prior to the acquisition of harris steel nucor was principally a domestic manufacturer of steel and steel products with customers located primarily in the us nucor was exposed to currency fluctuations however due to its joint ventures in brazil and australia and the direct reduced iron facility in trinidad when the company entered into the agreement to acquire harris steel in january 2007 nucor became exposed to canadian currency fluctuations and hedged a portion of the exposure associated with the closing of the transaction in march 2007 the company continues to be exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada

 item 1 business tableend overview 

nucor corporation was incorporated in delaware in 1958 the business of nucor corporation and its subsidiaries is the manufacture and sale of steel and steel products which accounted for all of the sales and the majority of the earnings in 2006 2005 and 2004 the earnings in 2005 include other income of 92 million in settlement of claims against third parties related to environmental matters the earnings in 2004 include other income of 16 million related to pretax gains on the sale of equipment 

nucor is the nation’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary material in producing our products in 2006 we recycled over 21 million tons of scrap steel 

segments 

nucor reports its results in two segments steel mills and steel products net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense earnings before income taxes assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2006 are set forth in note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2006 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference 

principal products produced 

principal products from the steel mills segment are hotrolled steel angles rounds flats channels rebar sheet wideflange beams pilings billets blooms beam blanks and plate and coldrolled steel principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders steel deck cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems and light gauge steel framing hotrolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap utilizing electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist girders and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hotrolled steel steel deck is manufactured from coldrolled steel 

markets and marketing 

in the steel mills segment hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders in addition other hotrolled and coldrolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained in 2006 approximately 92 of the steel mills segment production was sold to nonaffiliated customers the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment hotrolled steel and coldrolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers throughout the united states in 2006 approximately 75 of our sheet steel sales were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale these contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months 

in the steel products segment steel joists and joist girders and steel deck are sold to general contractors and fabricators throughout the united states substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained all sales contracts are firm fixedprice contracts and are normally competitively bid against other suppliers cold finished steel and steel fasteners are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the united states 

products from both segments are marketed mainly through inhouse sales forces the principal competitive factors are price and service the markets that nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions considerable competition exists from numerous domestic 

  

   

manufacturers and foreign imports unfairly traded steel imports have devastated the us steel industry and its workers we have continued the aggressive trade case work in which we have engaged over the years with our participation in the current statutory fiveyear sunset reviews of existing duties for coated sheet and carbon plate products in late 2006 the international trade commission chose to remove the duties that were in place on many of the countries involved in dumping these products into our country as a result more foreign steel may continue to enter our borders with negative effects on our business we are currently evaluating these decisions to begin our work in appeal and we will continue to fight illegally dumped foreign steel in support of free and fair trade through the legal process in february 2007 the united states requested world trade organization dispute settlement consultations with china regarding china’s provision of prohibited subsidies to its manufacturing exports we are optimistic that this request is an important first step in strengthening and enforcing existing us trade laws and represents the president’s commitment to achieving a longterm solution to illegal dumping and other unfair trade practices there can be no assurance that such solutions will be achieved nucor actively supports several organizations that promote free and fair trade and that oppose currency manipulation 

backlog 

in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 252 billion and 287 billion at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 5724 million and 4737 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively these orders are normally filled within one year 

raw materials 

the primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap which is acquired from numerous sources throughout the country following the escalation of scrap steel prices in 2003 and 2004 years in which prices increased 25 and 74 respectively nucor successfully implemented a raw material sales price surcharge in 2004 this surcharge has helped offset the impact of significantly more volatile scrap prices and has ensured that we were able to purchase the scrap needed to fill our customers’ orders the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton remained at historically high levels in 2005 and 2006 increasing 3 from 238 per ton in 2004 to 244 per ton in 2005 and increasing slightly to 246 in 2006 the primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel which is almost entirely purchased from the steel mills segment 

the steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and natural gas nucor uses cash flow hedges and natural gas purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process historically usbased manufacturers have enjoyed competitive energy costs that have allowed competition on equal footing in what is becoming more and more a global market in recent decades our government has allowed a growing overreliance on natural gas for the generation of electricity while at the same time preventing access to some of the most promising areas for natural gas exploration as a result natural gas prices have increased from less than 200 per mmbtu in the 1990’s nymex henryhub pricing to a peak of more than 1500 per mmbtu in december 2005 and to a calendar 2007 average price currently approaching 800 per mmbtu since an increasing share of electricity is now generated using natural gas higher natural gas prices are also increasing costs for consumers of electricity nucor actively supports several organizations that are promoting a more rational energy policy we believe this is critical for not only our future business success but also for the future of the us economy supplies of raw materials and energy have been and are expected to be adequate to operate our facilities 

  

   

strategy 

nucor has historically focused on greenfield growth and on optimizing existing operations in order to keep them stateoftheart and globally competitive capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately 940 million in 2007 more than twoandahalf times our capital expenditures in 2006 while approximately 500 million of the 2007 capital spending is allocated to our greenfield projects the remainder is an estimate of what we will spend to maintain the productivity and efficiency of our existing facilities in recent years our focus has expanded to include growing profitably through acquisitions and through joint ventures that leverage new technologies 

recent acquisitions greenfield projects and joint ventures 

in july 2004 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel tuscaloosa inc purchased substantially all of the steelmaking assets of corus tuscaloosa for a cash price of approximately 894 million the facility is a coiled plate mill that manufactures pressure vessel steel coil discrete plate and cuttolength plate products although this plant had an initial annual capacity of approximately 800000 tons our minimal investments in this facility combined with the benefits of our incentive pay program have increased the capacity to 1200000 tons currently this acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings and made significant operating contributions through 2006 

in august 2004 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel decatur llc purchased certain assets of worthington industries inc’s cold rolling mill located adjacent to our steel mill in decatur alabama for a cash purchase price of approximately 803 million the assets purchased include all of the buildings the pickle line fourstand tandem cold mill temper mill and annealing furnaces this 1000000ton cold mill facility has 600000 tons of annealing capacity and provides expanded valueadded products to our customers in the southeast 

in february 2005 nucor purchased the assets of fort howard steel inc’s operations in oak creek wisconsin for a cash purchase price of approximately 441 million this facility produces cold finished bar product and has approximately 140000 tons of annual capacity 

in june 2005 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel marion inc purchased substantially all of the assets of marion steel company for a cash purchase price of approximately 1107 million this facility produces angles flats rebar rounds and signposts this facility has grown its capacity from 400000 tons to 450000 tons largely as a result of our incentivebased compensation program 

in may 2006 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel connecticut inc purchased substantially all of the assets of connecticut steel corporation for a cash purchase price of approximately 439 million this facility produces wire rod rebar wire mesh and structural mesh located in wallingford connecticut the bar mill has an annual capacity of approximately 300000 tons of wire rod and approximately 85000 tons of wire mesh fabrication and structural mesh fabrication 

in november 2006 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary verco decking inc purchased substantially all of the assets of verco manufacturing company a producer of steel floor and roof decking in three locations in the western united states for a cash purchase price of approximately 1800 million these facilities have an annual capacity of approximately 100000 tons 

nucor is also growing through “greenfield” projects using new technologies and growing globally through joint ventures 

nucor began operations of its 100 owned castrip ® facility in crawfordsville indiana in 2002 this facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting to which nucor holds exclusive rights in the united 

  

   

states and brazil strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling allowing lower investment and operating costs reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology this process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions in 2006 the castrip facility in indiana set monthly shipping records and began serving our first contract customers for castrip products in 2005 we selected blytheville arkansas as the location for our second castrip production facility the blytheville arkansas castrip facility is under construction and is expected to begin operating in the second half of 2008 we also plan to establish at least one joint venture with a partner overseas in 2007 to utilize the castrip technology 

nucor established several joint ventures in the past few years forming partnerships to grow in the light gauge steel framing industry and reinforcing steel construction market 

in march 2006 nucor formed nexframe lp a joint venture with lennar corporation this joint venture was established to provide comprehensive light gauge steel framing solutions for residential construction markets across the nation 

in february 2004 nucor purchased a onehalf interest in harris steel inc a wholly owned subsidiary of harris steel group inc “harris steel” to serve the western and northeastern united states rebar fabrication markets in january 2007 nucor made a cash tender offer for all of the shares of harris steel at cdn4625 per share the offer places an approximate value of cdn125 billion us107 billion on the equity of harris steel the acquisition which will be nucor’s largest to date is expected to close in the first quarter upon acceptance by the shareholders of harris steel and satisfactory resolution of regulatory approvals 

raw materials projects 

nucor’s raw materials strategy includes the goal of controlling approximately 6000000 to 7000000 tons per year of high quality scrap substitutes for consumption by the steel mills 

in 2002 nucor entered a joint venture with the rio tinto group mitsubishi corporation and chinese steelmaker shougang corporation to construct a commercial hismelt ® plant in kwinana western australia the hismelt process converts iron ore fines and coal fines directly to liquid metal eliminating the need for a blast furnace sinterpellet plants and coke ovens additionally the hismelt technology offers an alternative supply of highquality iron units as a scrap substitute nucor has a 25 interest in the joint venture that owns the hismelt commercial plant construction was completed and the startup of operations began in 2005 the facility operated continuously through most of the second half of 2006 this plant has an initial annual capacity of 800000 metric tons which is expandable to over 1500000 metric tons 

in april 2003 nucor entered a joint venture with companhia vale do rio doce “cvrd” to construct and operate an environmentally friendly pig iron project in northern brazil the project named ferro gusa carajás sa “fgc” utilizes two conventional miniblast furnaces to produce about 380000 metric tons of pig iron per year using iron ore from cvrd’s carajás mine in northern brazil the charcoal source is exclusively from eucalyptus trees grown in a cultivated forest of about 80000 acres with the total project encompassing approximately 175000 acres in northern brazil the cultivated forest removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than the blast furnace emits production of pig iron began in the fourth quarter of 2005 nucor is purchasing all of the production of the plant 

in september 2004 nucor acquired the idled assets of a direct reduced iron “dri” plant located in louisiana and subsequently relocated these assets to trinidad construction is complete and heatup commenced in december 2006 in january 2007 nucor announced successful ramp up to full production capacity of about 

  

   

2000000 tons per year at nuiron unlimited the trinidad site benefits from a low cost supply of natural gas under a longterm contract and from favorable logistics for receipt of brazilian iron ore and shipment of dri to the united states 

environmental matters 

nucor is subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal state and local authorities in december 2000 nucor entered into a consent decree with the united states environmental protection agency and certain states in order to resolve alleged environmental violations under the terms of this decree nucor is conducting tests at some of its facilities performing corrective action where necessary and piloting certain pollution control technologies 

employees 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff only 70 employees are located in our executive offices all of nucor’s 11900 employees are engaged in its steel mills and steel products businesses none of our employees are represented by labor unions

 many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows because steel producers generally have high fixed costs reduced volumes result in operating inefficiencies over the fiveyear period ended december 31 2006 our net earnings have varied from a high of 176 billion in 2006 to a low of 628 million in 2003 future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

 item 1a risk factors tableend many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction energy appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows because steel producers generally have high fixed costs reduced volumes result in operating inefficiencies over the fiveyear period ended december 31 2006 our net earnings have varied from a high of 176 billion in 2006 to a low of 628 million in 2003 future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

   

overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products this excess capacity results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel at prices below their cost of production these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of lowpriced unfairly traded steel to the united states in recent years capacity growth in china has significantly exceeded the growth in chinese market demand a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could result in china increasing steel exports 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products we acquire our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous sources throughout the country although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities purchase prices of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility and growing scrap exports to satisfy the scrap demand of global competitors at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us 

if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004 also if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our steel making processes and the manufacturing processes of many of our customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gasses” ghg’s 

the us house of representatives has recently created a select committee on energy independence and global warming the speaker of the house has also asked other committees in the house that have jurisdiction over energy environment and technology policy to report legislation on these issues by june 2007 we expect the 

  

   

legislation when adopted will increase our energy and other operating costs unless this legislation addresses ghg’s globally these increased costs would hurt our ability to compete with foreign steel producers who would not be subject to this legislation these increased costs could also encourage more of our customers to relocate their manufacturing facilities to foreign countries that do not restrict ghg emissions and where nucor is not positioned to sell or distribute our products this legislation is also likely to increase energy costs for all us consumers resulting in a weaker domestic economy 

we plan to continue to implement acquisition strategies and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths realization of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these transactions with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

in addition we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the us which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies 

some of our competitors who have emerged from bankruptcy have been able to significantly reduce their operating costs which could negatively impact our competitive position 

over the past few years many domestic steel companies have sought protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code and have continued to operate some have reduced prices to maintain volumes and cash flows and obtained concessions from their labor unions and suppliers in some cases they have even expanded and modernized while in bankruptcy upon emergence from bankruptcy these companies or new entities that purchase their facilities through the bankruptcy process may be relieved of certain environmental retiree and other obligations additionally some of our competitors may grow by acquiring less expensive capacity out of bankruptcy as a result they may be able to operate with lower costs a primary competitive factor in the steel industry which could negatively affect our competitive position 

competition from other materials may materially adversely affect our business 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites glass plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could materially adversely affect prices and demand for our steel products 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2006 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 141 billion our business also requires substantial 

  

   

expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 700 million unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case any future significant acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates 

in 2000 we agreed to a comprehensive consent decree with the united states environmental protection agency and certain states to resolve disputes about alleged past environmental violations under the terms of the consent decree we are continuing to conduct tests at some of our facilities perform corrective action where necessary and pilot various pollution control technologies our accrued environmental costs include the expenses we expect to incur as a result of our ongoing compliance with the terms of this consent decree 

our competitors in the united states and in some western european and other countries with advanced industrial economies are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations the specific impact on each competitor may vary however depending upon a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities production processes such as a electricarc based versus an integrated producer and the specific products and services it provides to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted

   nucor has increased its cash dividend every year since the company began paying dividends in 1973 in 2006 in addition to raising the base dividend by 33 the board of directors doubled the supplemental dividend nucor has been paying since the second quarter of 2005 to recognize nucor’s extraordinary performance during the year as a result nucor paid a total dividend of 188 per share in 2006 compared with 067 per share in 2005 in february 2007 the board of directors approved a 10 increase in nucor’s quarterly base dividend to 011 per share and announced the continuation of the 050 per share quarterly supplemental dividend resulting in an annualized dividend rate of 244 per share the quarterly supplemental dividend of 050 per share represents a portion of a total supplemental dividend estimated to be 200 per share to be paid over the next four quarterly dividend payments the payment of any future supplemental dividends will depend however upon nucor’s earnings cash flows and financial position during the balance of the current year all of which could be adversely affected by many factors including many over which the company has little or no control see the discussion of the factors that affect nucor’s business and operations and involve risk and uncertainty in item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk —nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2006 43 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 57 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2006 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 

commodity price risk —in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in the first quarter of 2004 nucor initiated a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the historically high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins 

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process when management believes it is prudent to do so gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2006 accumulated other comprehensive income loss includes 69 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments a sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10 and 25 in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by 126 million and 315 million respectively any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax because these instruments are structured and used as hedges these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle

 item 1 business 

nucor corporation was incorporated in delaware in 1958 the business of nucor corporation and its subsidiaries is the manufacture and sale of steel and steel products which accounted for all of the sales and the majority of the earnings in 2005 2004 and 2003 the earnings in 2005 include other income of 92 million in settlement of claims against third parties related to environmental matters the earnings in 2004 and 2003 include other income of 16 million and 44 million respectively related to pretax gains on the sale of equipment the earnings in 2003 include a pretax gain of 71 million related to graphite electrodes antitrust settlements 

nucor is the nation’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary material in producing our products in 2005 we recycled over 23 million tons of scrap steel 

nucor reports its results in two segments steel mills and steel products net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense earnings loss before income taxes assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005 are set forth in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2005 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference 

principal products from the steel mills segment are hotrolled steel angles rounds flats channels sheet wideflange beams pilings billets blooms beam blanks and plate and coldrolled steel principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders steel deck cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems and light gauge steel framing hotrolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap utilizing electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist girders and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hotrolled steel steel deck is manufactured from coldrolled steel 

in the steel mills segment hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders in addition other hotrolled and coldrolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained in 2005 approximately 92 of the steel mills segment production was sold to nonaffiliated customers the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment hotrolled steel and coldrolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers throughout the united states in 2005 approximately 45 of our sheet steel sales were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale these contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 287 billion and 163 billion at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively these orders are normally filled within one year 

in the steel products segment steel joists and joist girders and steel deck are sold to general contractors and fabricators throughout the united states substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained all sales contracts are firm fixedprice contracts and are normally competitively bid against other suppliers cold finished steel and steel fasteners are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the united states nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 4737 million and 4084 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively these orders are normally filled within one year 

  

the primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap which is acquired from numerous sources throughout the country the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used increased 74 from 137 per ton in 2003 to 238 per ton in 2004 and increased an additional 3 to 244 per ton in 2005 in response to the escalating scrap steel prices nucor successfully implemented a raw material sales price surcharge in 2004 this surcharge has helped offset the impact of significantly higher scrap prices and has ensured that we were able to purchase the scrap needed to fill our customers’ orders the primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel which is almost entirely purchased from the steel mills segment 

the steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and natural gas nucor uses cash flow hedges and natural gas purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process historically usbased manufacturers have enjoyed competitive energy costs that have allowed competition on equal footing in what is becoming more and more a global market in recent decades our government has allowed a growing overreliance on natural gas for the generation of electricity while at the same time preventing access to some of the most promising areas for natural gas exploration as a result natural gas prices have increased from less than 200 per mmbtu in the 1990’s nymex henryhub pricing to a peak of more than 1500 per mmbtu in december 2005 since an increasing share of electricity is now generated using natural gas higher natural gas prices are also increasing costs for consumers of electricity nucor actively supports several organizations that are promoting a more rational energy policy we believe this is critical for not only our future business success but also for the future of the us economy supplies of raw materials and energy have been and are expected to be adequate to operate our facilities 

products from both segments are marketed mainly through inhouse sales forces the principal competitive factors are price and service the markets that nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions considerable competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports unfairly traded illegally dumped steel imports have devastated the us steel industry and its workers in march 2002 the bush administration imposed a series of tariffs known as section 201 to help the domestic steel industry recover from the illegal and predatory trading practices of foreign trading competitors in december 2003 the administration chose to end the temporary steel safeguard tariffs prior to their scheduled expiration however we are optimistic about the bush administration’s commitment to strengthen and enforce existing us trade laws and the president’s promise to work with congress to achieve a longterm solution to illegal dumping and other unfair trade practices that necessitated section 201 there can be no assurance that such solutions will be achieved nucor actively supports several organizations that promote free and fair trade and that oppose currency manipulation 

nucor has historically focused on optimizing existing operations to ensure that they are among the most productive and efficient facilities in the united states in recent years however our focus has expanded to include growing profitably through acquisitions particularly in the steel mills segment 

in july 2004 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel tuscaloosa inc purchased substantially all of the steelmaking assets of corus tuscaloosa for a price of approximately 894 million the facility is a coiled plate mill that manufactures pressure vessel steel coil discrete plate and cuttolength plate products with an initial annual capacity of approximately 800000 tons our continued investments in this facility combined with the benefits of our incentive pay program have increased the capacity to 1200000 tons currently this acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings and made a significant operating contribution in the second half of 2004 and in 2005 

in august 2004 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel decatur llc purchased certain assets of worthington industries inc’s cold rolling mill located adjacent to our steel mill in decatur alabama for a cash purchase price of approximately 803 million the assets purchased include all of the buildings the pickle line fourstand tandem cold mill temper mill and annealing furnaces this 1000000ton cold mill facility has 600000 tons of annealing capacity and provides expanded valueadded products to our customers in the southeast 

  

in february 2005 nucor purchased the assets of fort howard steel inc’s operations in oak creek wisconsin for a cash purchase price of approximately 441 million this facility produces cold finished bar product and has approximately 140000 tons of annual capacity 

in june 2005 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel marion inc purchased substantially all of the assets of marion steel company for a cash purchase price of approximately 1107 million this facility produces angles flats rebar rounds and signposts this facility has already grown its capacity from 400000 tons to 450000 tons largely as a result of our incentivebased compensation program 

nucor is also growing through “greenfield” projects using new technologies and growing globally through joint ventures 

nucor began operations of its 100 owned castrip ® facility in crawfordsville indiana in 2002 this facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting to which nucor holds exclusive rights in the united states and brazil strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling allowing lower investment and operating costs reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology this process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions particularly nox the castrip process achieved commercial viability in 2004 we have selected nucoryamato steel in blytheville arkansas as the location for our second castrip production facility we also plan to establish at least one joint venture with a partner overseas in 2006 to utilize the castrip technology 

nucor established two rebar fabrication joint ventures in 2004 and 2005 with leaders in the reinforcing steel construction markets in 2004 nucor purchased a onehalf interest in harris steel inc a wholly owned subsidiary of harris steel group inc to serve the western and northeastern us rebar fabrication markets this joint venture continues to grow and to generate strong returns in 2005 nucor entered into an agreement with ambassador steel corporation to form nufab rebar llc nucor owns 49 of this rebar fabrication joint venture which should allow us to expand nucor’s rebar fabrication presence into the central and southern regions of the country these investments in rebar fabrication complement our existing facilities by adding downstream integration from our bar mills into the valueadded process 

nucor’s raw materials strategy includes the goal of controlling between 6000000 and 7000000 tons per year of our iron units consumption three projects in particular represent nucor’s initial steps towards achieving this goal the hismelt ® facility in australia the sustainable pig iron project in brazil and the direct reduced iron “dri” plant in trinidad 

in 2002 nucor entered a joint venture with the rio tinto group mitsubishi corporation and chinese steelmaker shougang corporation to construct a commercial hismelt plant in kwinana western australia the hismelt process converts iron ore fines and coal fines directly to liquid metal eliminating the need for a blast furnace sinterpellet plants and coke ovens additionally the hismelt technology offers an alternative supply of highquality iron units as a scrap substitute nucor has a 25 interest in the joint venture that owns the hismelt commercial plant construction was completed and the startup of operations began in 2005 this plant has an initial annual capacity of 800000 metric tons which is expandable to over 1500000 tons 

in 2003 nucor entered a joint venture with companhia vale do rio doce “cvrd” to construct and operate an environmentally responsible pig iron project in northern brazil the project named ferro gusa carajás sa will utilize two conventional miniblast furnaces to produce about 380000 metric tons of pig iron per year in its initial phase using iron ore from cvrd’s carajás mine in northern brazil the charcoal source will be exclusively from eucalyptus trees grown in a cultivated forest of 82000 acres with the total forest encompassing approximately 200000 acres in northern brazil the cultivated forest removes more carbon dioxide than the blast furnace process emits production of pig iron began in the fourth quarter of 2005 it is anticipated that nucor will purchase all of the production of the plant 

  

in september 2004 nucor exercised its option to acquire the idled assets of american iron reduction’s dri plant located in convent louisiana these assets have been relocated to trinidad and construction is well under way we expect dri production to begin in the fourth quarter of 2006 with an annual capacity of 1800000 metric tons per year the trinidad site benefits from a low cost supply of natural gas under a longterm contract and from favorable logistics for receipt of brazilian iron ore and shipment of dri to the united states this new entity is named nuiron unlimted and has a capital budget of approximately 2250 million 

nucor is subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal state and local authorities in december 2000 nucor entered into a consent decree with the united states environmental protection agency and certain states in order to resolve alleged environmental violations under the terms of this decree nucor is conducting tests at some of its facilities performing corrective action where necessary and piloting certain pollution control technologies 

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff only 66 employees are located in our executive offices all of nucor’s 11300 employees are engaged in its steel mills and steel products businesses none of our employees are represented by labor unions

 item 1a risk factors 

many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions our business supports cyclical industries such as the construction energy appliance and automotive industries as a result downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows because steel producers generally have high fixed costs reduced volumes result in operating inefficiencies over the fiveyear period ended december 31 2005 our net earnings have varied from a high of 131 billion in 2005 to a low of 628 million in 2003 future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

overcapacity in the steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products this excess capacity results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel at prices below their cost of production these imports which are also affected by demand in the domestic market international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions can result in downward pressure on steel prices which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

overcapacity in china the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel has the potential to cause steel dumping in us markets a significant decrease in china’s rate of economic expansion could reduce demand for steel products in that country resulting in china increasing steel exports 

the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials particularly scrap steel 

we rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products we acquire our primary raw material steel scrap from numerous sources throughout the country although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities purchase prices of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility at any given time we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us 

if our suppliers increase the price of our critical raw materials we may not have alternative sources of supply in addition to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004 if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions and suffer harm to our reputation 

changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business 

our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions these market conditions often are affected by weather political and economic factors beyond our control disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers increases in our energy costs could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we plan to continue to implement acquisition strategies and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses 

we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths realization of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these transactions with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses 

in addition we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the us which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies 

some of our competitors who have emerged from bankruptcy have lowered their operating costs which could negatively impact our competitive position 

over the past few years many domestic steel companies have sought protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code and have continued to operate some have reduced prices to maintain volumes and cash flows and obtained concessions from their labor unions and suppliers in some cases they have even expanded and modernized while in bankruptcy upon emergence from bankruptcy these companies or new entities that purchase their facilities through the bankruptcy process may be relieved of certain environmental retiree and other obligations additionally some of our competitors may grow by acquiring less expensive capacity out of bankruptcy as a result they may be able to operate with lower costs a primary competitive factor in the steel industry which could negatively affect our competitive position 

  

competition from other materials may materially adversely affect our business 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites glass plastic and wood increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could materially adversely affect prices and demand for our steel products 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 

the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks particularly unplanned events such as explosions fires other accidents inclement weather and transportation interruptions while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance 

our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 

our operations are capital intensive for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2005 our total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately 134 billion our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance although we expect requirements for our business needs including the funding of capital expenditures debt service for financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 7000 million unsecured revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that this will be the case any future significant acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources 

environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and we accordingly make provision for the estimated costs of compliance these laws are evolving and becoming increasingly stringent resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates 

we have agreed to a comprehensive consent decree with the united states environmental protection agency and certain states in order to resolve alleged past environmental violations under the terms of the consent decree we are conducting tests at some of our facilities performing corrective action where necessary and piloting certain pollution control technologies the accrued environmental costs include the expenses that we expect to incur as a result of the consent decree 

we believe our competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations the specific impact on each competitor may vary however depending upon a number of factors including the age and location of operating facilities production processes such as a minimill versus an integrated producer and the specific products and services it provides to the extent that competitors particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products are not required to incur equivalent costs our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

information required by this item is incorporated by reference to nucor’s 2005 annual report page 3 forwardlooking statements and pages 20 through 29 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

interest rate risk – nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2005 43 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 57 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2005 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 

commodity price risk – in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirement and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in the first quarter of 2004 nucor initiated a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the historically high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins 

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process when management believes it is prudent to do so gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2005 accumulated other comprehensive income loss includes 558 million in unrealized netoftax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments a sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10 and 25 in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by 201 million and 500 million respectively any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss net of tax because these instruments are structured and used as hedges these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle

nucor is the nation’s largest recycler using scrap steel as the primary material in producing our products in 2004 we recycled over 17 million tons of scrap steel 

  

nucor reports its results in two segments steel mills and steel products net sales to external customers intercompany sales depreciation expense earnings loss before income taxes assets and capital expenditures by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2004 are set forth in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2004 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference 

  

principal products from the steel mills segment are hotrolled steel angles rounds flats channels sheet wideflange beams pilings billets blooms beam blanks and plate and coldrolled steel principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders steel deck cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems and light gauge steel framing hotrolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap utilizing electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist girders and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hotrolled steel steel deck is manufactured from coldrolled steel 

  

in the steel mills segment hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders in addition other hotrolled and coldrolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained in 2004 approximately 90 of the steel mills segment production was sold to nonaffiliated customers the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment hotrolled steel and coldrolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers throughout the united states in 2004 approximately 50 of our sheet steel sales were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale these contracts permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing raw material costs and typically have terms ranging from six to twelve months in the steel mills segment nucor’s backlog of orders was approximately 163 billion and 124 billion at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively these orders are normally filled within one year 

  

in the steel products segment steel joists and joist girders and steel deck are sold to general contractors and fabricators throughout the united states substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained all sales contracts are firm fixedprice contracts and are normally competitively bid against other suppliers cold finished steel and steel fasteners are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the united states nucor’s backlog of orders in the steel products segment was approximately 4084 million and 2345 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively these orders are normally filled within one year 

  

the primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap which is acquired from numerous sources throughout the country the average scrap cost per ton purchased increased 99 55 from december 2003 to december 2004 in response to escalating scrap steel prices nucor successfully implemented a raw material sales price surcharge in 2004 this surcharge has helped offset the impact of significantly higher scrap prices and has ensured that we were able to purchase the scrap needed to fill our customers’ orders the steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and natural gas nucor uses cash flow hedges and natural gas 

  

purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process the primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel which is primarily purchased from the steel mills segment supplies of raw materials and energy have been and are expected to be adequate to operate the facilities 

  

products from both segments are marketed mainly through inhouse sales forces the principal competitive factors are price and service the markets that nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions considerable competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports unfairly traded illegally dumped steel imports have devastated the us steel industry and its workers in march 2002 the bush administration imposed a series of tariffs known as section 201 to help the domestic steel industry recover from the illegal and predatory trading practices of foreign trading competitors in december 2003 the administration chose to end the temporary steel safeguard tariffs prior to their scheduled expiration however we are optimistic about the bush administration’s commitment to strengthen and enforce existing us trade laws and the president’s promise to work with congress to achieve a longterm solution to illegal dumping and other unfair trade practices that necessitated section 201 there can be no assurance that such solutions will be achieved nucor actively supports several organizations that promote free and fair trade and that oppose currency manipulation 

  

nucor has historically focused on optimizing existing operations to ensure that they are among the most productive and efficient facilities in the united states in recent years however our focus has expanded to include growing profitably through acquisitions particularly in the steel mills segment 

  

in july 2002 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel decatur llc purchased substantially all of the assets of trico steel company llc for a purchase price of 1177 million located in decatur alabama the sheet steel facility originally began operations in 1997 and has an annual capacity of approximately 1900000 tons the purchase strategy called for a major renovation of the facility capital expenditures for this facility have exceeded 1000 million from acquisition through 2004 although we experienced equipment problems early in 2003 we overcame these issues and generated an operating profit at this sheet mill in 2004 in august 2004 nucor steel decatur llc purchased certain assets of worthington industries inc’s cold rolling mill located adjacent to our steel mill for a cash purchase price of approximately 803 million the assets purchased include all of the buildings the pickle line fourstand tandem cold mill temper mill and annealing furnaces adjacent to the current nucor steel decatur llc steel plant this 1000000ton cold mill facility has 600000 tons of annealing capacity and provides expanded valueadded products to our customers in the southeast 

  

in december 2002 nucor and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries purchased substantially all of the assets of birmingham steel corporation “birmingham steel” for a cash purchase price excluding transaction costs of approximately 6150 million including 1169 million in inventory and receivables primary assets purchased were birmingham steel’s four operating mills in birmingham alabama kankakee illinois seattle washington and jackson mississippi with a combined annual capacity of approximately 2200000 tons these mills made significant contributions to nucor’s sales and earnings in 2003 and 2004 

  

in july 2004 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel tuscaloosa inc purchased substantially all of the steelmaking assets of corus tuscaloosa for a price of approximately 894 million the facility is a coiled plate mill that manufactures pressure vessel steel coil discrete plate and cuttolength plate products with an annual capacity of approximately 800000 tons this acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings and made a significant operating contribution in the second half of 2004 

  

in february 2005 nucor purchased the assets of fort howard steel inc’s operations in oak creek wisconsin for a cash purchase price of approximately 442 million this facility produces cold finished bar product and has approximately 140000 tons of annual capacity 

  

also in february 2005 nucor announced plans for the addition of vacuum degassers at the sheet mills in hickman arkansas and decatur alabama the investment in these vacuum degassers will enable nucor to 

  

produce higher grades of sheet steel for automotive and appliance customers in the southern united states and mexico the capital cost to install each of the degassers is estimated to be less than 200 million the new vacuum degassers should be operational by the first half of 2006 and will increase total high quality valueadded annual capacity at the mills by an estimated 1000000 tons 

  

nucor is also growing through “greenfield” projects using new technologies and growing globally through joint ventures 

  

nucor began operations of its 100 owned castrip ® facility in crawfordsville indiana in 2002 this facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting to which nucor holds exclusive rights in the united states and brazil strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling allowing lower investment and operating costs reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology this process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel by generating significantly lower emissions particularly nox the castrip process has achieved commercial viability and we are in the process of selecting a site for our second castrip operation in the united states we also plan to establish at least one joint venture with a partner overseas in 2005 to utilize the castrip technology 

  

in 2004 nucor purchased a onehalf interest in harris steel inc a wholly owned subsidiary of harris steel group inc for a cash purchase price of approximately 210 million in addition harris steel group may receive up to an additional 60 million upon the achievement of certain operating results of the venture through 2008 the investment in this rebar fabricator complements our existing facilities by adding downstream integration from our bar mills into the valueadded process 

  

nucor’s raw materials strategy includes the goal of controlling approximately onethird of our iron units consumption which currently equates to between 6000000 and 7000000 tons per year of high quality scrap substitutes three projects in particular represent nucor’s initial steps towards achieving this goal the hismelt ® facility in australia the sustainable pig iron project in brazil and the direct reduced iron plant in trinidad 

  

in 2002 nucor entered a joint venture with the rio tinto group mitsubishi corporation and chinese steelmaker shougang corporation to construct a commercial hismelt plant in kwinana western australia the hismelt process converts iron ore fines and coal fines directly to liquid metal eliminating the need for a blast furnace sinterpellet plants and coke ovens the hismelt technology would offer an alternative supply of highquality iron units as a scrap substitute nucor has a 25 interest in the joint venture that owns the hismelt commercial plant construction is substantially completed and production is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2005 this plant will have an initial annual capacity of 800000 metric tons 

  

in 2003 nucor entered a joint venture with companhia vale do rio doce “cvrd” to construct and operate an environmentally responsible pig iron project in northern brazil the project named ferro gusa carajás sa will utilize two conventional miniblast furnaces to produce about 380000 metric tons of pig iron per year in its initial phase using iron ore from cvrd’s carajas mine in northern brazil the charcoal source will be exclusively from eucalyptus trees grown in a cultivated forest of 82000 acres with the total forest encompassing approximately 200000 acres in northern brazil the cultivated forest removes more carbon dioxide than the blast furnace process emits it is anticipated that nucor will purchase all of the production of the plant production is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2005 

  

in september 2004 nucor exercised its option to acquire the idled assets of american iron reduction’s direct reduced iron “dri” plant located in convent louisiana nucor began dismantling and refurbishing the plant for relocation to trinidad and to expand annual capacity to 1800000 metric tons per year the trinidad site will benefit from a low cost supply of natural gas and favorable logistics for receipt of brazilian iron ore and shipment of dri to the united states capital expenditures for this facility are expected to be approximately 2250 million and operations are expected to begin in early 2006 

  

nucor is subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal state and local authorities in december 2000 nucor entered into a consent decree with the united states environmental protection agency and certain states in order to resolve alleged environmental violations under the terms of this decree nucor is conducting tests at some of its facilities performing corrective action where necessary and piloting certain pollution control technologies 

  

nucor has a simple streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to be innovative our organization is highly decentralized with most daytoday operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff only 59 employees are located in our executive offices all of nucor’s 10600 employees are engaged in its steel mills and steel products businesses none of our employees are represented by labor unions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 

  

interest rate risk – nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variablerate and fixedrate debt at december 31 2004 43 of nucor’s longterm debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually the remaining 57 of nucor’s debt is at fixed rates future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings from time to time nucor makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes as of december 31 2004 there were no such contracts outstanding nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities as a result we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 

  

commodity price risk – in the ordinary course of business nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy principally scrap steel electricity and natural gas we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand in the first quarter of 2004 nucor initiated a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the historically high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins 

  

nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process when it is deemed prudent to do so by management gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction at december 31 2004 accumulated other comprehensive loss includes 12 million in unrealized netoftax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments a sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10 and 25 in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by 117 million and 291 million respectively any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive loss net of tax because these instruments are structured and used as hedges these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle

principal products from the steel mills segment are hotrolled steel angles rounds flats channels sheet wideflange beams pilings billets blooms beam blanks and plate and coldrolled steel principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders steel deck cold finished steel steel fasteners metal building systems and light gauge steel framing hotrolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap utilizing electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist girders and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hotrolled steel steel deck is manufactured from coldrolled steel 

  

in the steel mills segment hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders in addition other hotrolled and coldrolled steel are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained in 2003 approximately 93 of the steel mills segment production was sold to nonaffiliated customers the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment hotrolled steel and coldrolled steel are sold primarily to steel service centers fabricators and manufacturers throughout the united states 

  

in the steel products segment steel joists and joist girders and steel deck are sold to general contractors and fabricators throughout the united states substantially all work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained all sales contracts are firm fixedprice contracts and are normally competitively bid against other suppliers cold finished steel and steel fasteners are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained cold finished steel and steel fasteners are sold primarily to distributors and manufacturers throughout the united states 

  

the primary raw material for the steel mills segment is ferrous scrap which is acquired from numerous sources throughout the country scrap prices increased 65 57 per ton from december 2002 to december 2003 in response to this increase nucor implemented a raw material surcharge that was effective in january 2004 this surcharge will help provide increased margins for our products and will help ensure that we will be able to purchase the scrap needed to fill our customers’ needs the steel mills are also large consumers of electricity and gas nucor uses natural gas purchase contracts to partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during the manufacturing process the primary raw material for the steel products segment is steel which is primarily purchased from the steel mills segment supplies of raw materials and energy have been and are expected to be adequate to operate the facilities

item 1 business continued 

  

products from both segments are marketed principally through inhouse sales forces the principal competitive factors are price and service considerable competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports during 2000 and 2001 imports of steel increased significantly much of it at illegally dumped prices in march 2002 the bush administration imposed a series of tariffs for many products over a threeyear period that helped reduce the flood of imports in december 2003 the administration chose to end the temporary steel safeguard tariffs known as section 201 prior to their scheduled expiration however we are encouraged by the bush administration’s commitment to strengthen existing us trade laws by closing the loopholes that permit import surges circumvention of existing laws and repetitive dumping 

  

nucor believes that the most significant factors with respect to its competitive position are the low cost and efficiency of its production processes the markets that nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions

nucor began operations of its 100 owned castrip ® facility in crawfordsville indiana in may 2002 this facility uses the breakthrough technology of strip casting to which nucor holds exclusive rights in the united states and brazil strip casting involves the direct casting of molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling allowing lower investment and operating costs reduced energy consumption and smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology this process also reduces the overall environmental impact of producing steel through significantly lower emissions particularly nox during the second half of 2003 process improvements were made that increased the output of the castrip facility improved product quality and improved the life of key consumables multiladle casting sequences are now part of routine production increased production and improved product quality are expected to continue in 2004 

  

in july 2002 nucor’s wholly owned subsidiary nucor steel decatur llc purchased substantially all of the assets of trico steel company llc for a purchase price of 117700000 located in decatur alabama the sheet steel facility originally began operations in 1997 and has an annual capacity of approximately 1900000 tons the purchase strategy called for a major renovation of the facility capital expenditures for this facility were approximately 68000000 in 2002 and 17000000 in 2003 nucor steel decatur experienced equipment problems during startup in the second quarter of 2003 however we have overcome these issues to build volume rapidly and improve quality this acquisition was not material to the consolidated financial statements and did not result in goodwill or other intangible assets

1999  the earnings of 2001 also include a pretax gain of 20200000 from the
sale of nucor iron carbide inc in trinidad  nucor reports in one segment

     principal steel products are hotrolled steel angles rounds flats
channels sheet wideflange beams pilings billets blooms beam blanks and
plate coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist girders
steel deck and steel fasteners  hotrolled steel is manufactured principally
from scrap utilizing electric furnaces continuous casting and automated
rolling mills  coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist
girders and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of
hotrolled steel  steel deck is manufactured from coldrolled steel

     hotrolled and coldrolled sheet steel are produced to customer orders
other hotrolled steel coldrolled steel cold finished steel and steel
fasteners are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained
in 2001 approximately 90 of hot and coldrolled steel production was sold to
nonaffiliated customers the remainder was used in the manufacture of other
steel products as described above  hotrolled steel coldrolled steel and
cold finished steel are sold primarily to steel service centers fabricators
and manufacturers throughout the united states  steel fasteners are sold to
distributors and manufacturers

     steel joists and joist girders and steel deck are sold to general
contractors and fabricators throughout the united states  substantially all
work is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained
all sales contracts are firmfixedprice contracts and are normally
competitively bid against other suppliers

     the primary raw material is ferrous scrap which is acquired from numerous
sources throughout the country  the operating facilities are large consumers
of electricity and gas  nucor sometimes uses natural gas purchase contracts to
partially manage its exposure to price risk of natural gas that is used during
the manufacturing process supplies of raw materials and energy have been and
are expected to be adequate to operate the facilities

     steel products are marketed principally through inhouse sales forces
the principal competitive factors are price and service  considerable
competition exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports
during 1999 2000 and 2001 imports of steel increased significantly much of
it at dumping prices  in march 2002 president bush imposed a series of
tariffs over a threeyear period that should reduce illegal imports  the
tariffs begin at 30 for many steel products then gradually decline in years
two and three

     nucor believes that the most significant factor with respect to its
competitive position is its low cost and efficiency of its production
processes  the markets that nucor serves are tied to capital and durable goods
spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions

item 1  business

   nucor corporation was incorporated in delaware in 1958

   the business of nucor corporation and its subsidiaries is and for a number
of years has been the manufacture and sale of steel products which accounted
for all of sales and earnings in 2000 1999 and 1998 nucor reports in one
segment

   principal steel products are hotrolled steel angles rounds flats
channels sheet wideflange beams pilings billets blooms beam blanks and
plate coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist girders
steel deck and steel fasteners hotrolled steel is manufactured principally
from scrap utilizing electric furnaces continuous casting and automated
rolling mills coldrolled steel cold finished steel steel joists and joist
girders and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of
hotrolled steel steel deck is manufactured from coldrolled steel

   hotrolled steel coldrolled steel cold finished steel and steel fasteners
are manufactured in standard sizes and inventories are maintained in 2000
approximately 87 of hot and coldrolled steel production was sold to
nonaffiliated customers the remainder was used in the manufacture of other
steel products as described above hotrolled steel coldrolled steel and cold
finished steel are sold primarily to steel service centers fabricators and
manufacturers steel fasteners are sold to distributors and manufacturers

   steel joists and joist girders and steel deck are sold to general
contractors and fabricators throughout the united states substantially all work
is to order and no unsold inventories of finished products are maintained all
sales contracts are firmfixedprice contracts and are normally competitively
bid against other suppliers

   the primary raw material is ferrous scrap which is acquired from numerous
sources throughout the country the operating facilities are large consumers of
electricity and gas supplies of raw materials and energy have been and are
expected to be adequate to operate the facilities

   steel products are marketed principally through inhouse sales forces the
principal competitive factors are price and service considerable competition
exists from numerous domestic manufacturers and foreign imports during 1998
1999 and 2000 imports of steel increased significantly much of it at dumping
prices the effects of these imports decreased during the latter part of 1999
but increased during 2000 nucor believes that the most significant factor with
respect to its competitive position is its low cost and efficiency of its
production processes the markets that nucor serves are tied to capital and
durable goods spending and are affected by changes in economic conditions

   nucor recently exited two businesses that were not core to its growth
strategy with the sale of the grinding ball equipment at one of the utah
facilities at the end of 2000 and the sale of the nucor bearing products
facility in north carolina in february 2001 both operations accounted for small
percentages of nucors sales

produce thinstrip sheet steel strip casting involves the direct casting of
molten steel into final shape and thickness without further hot or cold rolling
allowing lower investment and operating costs reduced energy consumption and
smaller scale plants than can be economically built with current technology

     in march 2001 nucor announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to
purchase substantially all of the assets of auburn steel companys merchant
steel bar facility in auburn new york for approximately 115000000 this
