our business 

omnicom is a strategic holding company providing advertising marketing and corporate communications services to clients through our branded networks and agencies around the world we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against other global national and regional advertising and marketing services companies as well as technology social media and professional services companies the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and media has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to global service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing services designed to optimize their total marketing expenditure

our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients our fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model requires that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure this collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and comprehensive manner we use our clientcentric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing clients moving into new markets and obtaining new clients in addition to collaborating through our client service models our agencies and networks collaborate across internally developed technology platforms annalect our proprietary data and analytics platform serves as the strategic resource for all of our agencies and networks to share when developing client service strategies across our virtual networks omni our peoplebased precision marketing and insights platform identifies and defines personalized consumer experiences at scale across creative media and other disciplines 

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives our service offerings include 



certain business trends have impacted our business and industry these trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they tend to continue to consolidate their business within one or a small number of service providers in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points we have structured our business around these trends we believe that our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions provides a competitive advantage to our business in the past and we expect this to continue over the medium and long term our key client matrix organization structure facilitates superior client management and allows for greater integration of the services required by the world’s largest brands our overarching strategy is to continue to use our virtual client networks to grow our business relationships with our largest clients by serving them across our networks disciplines and geographies 

as the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy moderated we experienced improvement in our business in 2021 as compared to 2020 in 2021 revenue increased 11183 million or 85 compared to 2020 the increase in revenue primarily reflects increased client spending in all our disciplines and across all our geographic areas compared to the prior year and the strengthening of most foreign currencies primarily the british pound and the euro against the us dollar the increase in revenue yearoveryear was impacted by a reduction in acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue primarily due to the sale of a specialty media business in the second quarter of 2021 

global economic conditions may continue to be volatile as long as the covid19 pandemic remains a public health threat we expect global economic performance and the performance of our businesses to vary by geography and discipline until the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy subsides

 item 1a risk factors 

economic risks 

adverse economic conditions a reduction in client spending a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

economic conditions have a direct impact on our business results of operations and financial position adverse economic conditions including those caused by the covid19 pandemic severe and sustained inflation in countries that comprise our major markets supply chain issues affecting the distribution of our clients’ products or a disruption in the credit markets pose a risk that clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue which would adversely affect our 

business results of operations and financial position a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements in addition a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients liquidity and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements which may not be available on favorable terms or at all even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital such actions may not be effective 

in an economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be insufficient less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business results of operations and financial position and the covid19 pandemic or other similar public health crises could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position in the future 

the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our business results of operations and financial position in 2020 and through the first quarter of 2021 as most of our clients’ businesses were affected by the pandemic as long as the covid19 pandemic including any existing or new variants remains a public health threat global economic conditions will continue to be volatile and such uncertainty cuts across all clients industries and geographies demand for certain of our service offerings may be adversely affected by new developments in the pandemic including the emergence of new variants or other similar public health crises the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic or other similar public health crises on our business will depend on numerous factors that we are not able to accurately predict 

business and operational risks 

clients periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive industry key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently particularly large multinational clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

as a service business our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be 

adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in 2021 our 100 largest clients represented approximately 54 of our revenue clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to connect with our clients people and others and store business and financial data increased cybersecurity threats and attacks which are constantly evolving pose a risk to our systems and networks for example in february 2021 we experienced a cybersecurity incident that resulted in the disruption of certain of our information technology systems at one of our networks based on our investigation the incident did not have a material impact on our business results of operations or financial position however cybersecurity threats and attacks in the future could be material security breaches improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public we also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations our systems and processes may be unable to prevent future material security breaches and such breaches could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we also use thirdparty service providers including cloud providers to store transmit and process data these thirdparty service providers could also be subject to cybersecurity incidents that could adversely affect us 

in addition through 2021 the overwhelming majority of our workforce temporarily transitioned to working from home during the covid19 pandemic the increase in the number of our employees working from home may increase certain business and procedural control risks including increased risk of cybersecurity incidents and exposure of sensitive business and client advertising and marketing information as well as personal data or information 

risks related to international operations 

currency exchange rate fluctuations have impacted and in the future could impact our business results of operations and financial position 

in 2021 our international operations represented approximately 49 of our revenue we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone the united kingdom or the uk australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly their financial statements are translated into us dollars as a result both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our business results of operations and financial position in addition funds transferred to the united states can be adversely or beneficially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in highgrowth markets and developing countries which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions competition for new business and staff currency exchange rate fluctuations political conditions differing tax and regulatory environments and other risks associated with extensive international operations in addition we conduct business in numerous highgrowth markets and developing countries that tend to have longer billing collection cycles currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped vague inconsistently enforced retroactively applied or frequently changed the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally our operations are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and stringent and any changes and violations could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation for financial information by geographic region see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have substantial operations in the uk and the euro zone in 2020 the uk completed its separation from the european union or eu commonly referred to as “brexit” and entered into an agreement or brexit agreement with the eu that defines the terms of their relationship covering among other things trade and tariffs services and travel the uncertainties related to the impact of the brexit agreement have crossborder operational financial and tax implications among others and any economic volatility that may arise in the uk the eu or elsewhere may adversely affect our business 

risks related to acquisitions 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the process we conduct business legal and financial due diligence to identify and evaluate material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our business results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized knowhow of the acquired workforce as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at june 30 and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

regulatory risks 

government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs such regulation may seek among other things to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and a number of international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising media these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

our businesses could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by laws and regulations aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change specifically these companies may seek to pass their increased costs through to their customers if our clients are impacted by such laws or regulations either directly or indirectly their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs which could impact our business results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

as the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy moderated we experienced improvement in our business in 2021 as compared to 2020 in 2021 revenue increased 11183 million or 85 compared to 2020 the increase in revenue primarily reflects increased client spending in all our disciplines and across all our geographic areas compared to the prior year and the strengthening of most foreign currencies primarily the british pound and the euro against the us dollar the increase in revenue yearoveryear was partially offset by a reduction in acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reflecting the sale of icon international or icon a specialty media business in the second quarter of 2021 

global economic conditions may continue to be volatile as long as the covid19 pandemic remains a public health threat which could negatively impact our clients spending plans we expect global economic performance and the performance of our businesses to vary by geography and discipline until the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy subsides

we are a strategic holding company providing advertising marketing and corporate communications services to clients through our branded networks and agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our networks and agencies provide a comprehensive range of services in the following fundamental disciplines advertising precision marketing commerce  brand consulting experiential execution  support public relations and healthcare advertising includes creative services across digital and traditional media and strategic media planning and buying and data analytics services precision marketing includes digital and direct marketing digital transformation and data and analytics commerce  brand consulting services include brand consulting strategy and research and retail ecommerce experiential marketing services include live and digital events and experience design and execution execution  support includes field marketing sales support digital and physical merchandising and pointofsale as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services public relations services include corporate communications crisis management public affairs and media and media relations services healthcare includes advertising and media services to global healthcare and pharmaceutical clients our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our networks and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients our fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model requires that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client 

networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure this collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and comprehensive manner we use our clientcentric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing clients moving into new markets and obtaining new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or could serve our existing clients

we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities as well as to identify nonstrategic or underperforming businesses for disposition 

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets and have a large and diverse client base for the year ended december 31 2021 our largest client represented 32 of revenue and our 100 largest clients which represent many of the worlds major marketers represented approximately 54 of revenue our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy with no one industry representing more than 16 of our revenue in 2021 although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

certain global events targeted by major marketers for advertising expenditures such as the fifa world cup and the olympics and certain national events such as the us election process may affect our revenue periodoverperiod in certain businesses typically these events do not have a significant impact on our revenue in any period 

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance adverse global or regional economic conditions including those arising from the covid19 pandemic severe and sustained inflation in countries that comprise our major markets and client supply chain issues pose a risk that our clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services which would reduce the demand for our services revenue is typically lower in the first and third quarters a nd higher i n the second and fourth quarters reflecting client spending patterns during the year and additional project work that usually occurs in the fourth quarter 

beginning in march 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021 our business experienced the effects from reductions in client spending due to the economic impact related to the covid19 pandemic while mixed by business and geography the spending reductions impacted all our businesses and markets globally the most impacted businesses were our experiential discipline especially in our event marketing businesses and our execution  support discipline primarily in field marketing most of our markets began to improve versus the prior year in the first quarter of 2021 and the improvement continued through the end of 2021 as clients substantially increased their spending on our services the economic and fiscal issues including impacts related to the pandemic facing the countries we operate in could cause economic uncertainty and volatility however the impact on our business will likely vary by country we monitor economic conditions closely as well as client revenue levels and other factors in response to reductions in revenue we can take actions to align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital however there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions reductions in client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments 

general marketing communications trends impact our business and industry and on balance we believe that these effects are generally positive these trends include integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms and clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency many of them have made it a practice to consolidate their business within one or a small number of service providers in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points we have structured our business around these trends certain trends such as increased spending on digital marketing platforms and our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions provide a competitive advantage to our business and we expect this advantage to continue over the medium and long term 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we focus on are revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by principal regional market and marketing discipline the impact from foreign currency exchange rate changes growth from acquisitions net of dispositions and growth from our largest clients operating expenses are comprised of cost of services selling general and administrative expenses or sga and depreciation and amortization 

in 2021 our revenue increased 11183 million or 85 compared to 2020 changes in foreign exchange rates increased revenue 22 acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced revenue 39 and organic growth increased revenue 102 the reduction in acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reflects the sale of icon in the second quarter of 2021 in 2021 our business experienced a recovery from the negative effects of the covid19 pandemic in all our disciplines and regional markets as compared to 2020 the negative effects from the pandemic did not significantly impact our major markets and businesses until late in the first quarter of 2020 as a result the improvement in revenue in 2021 versus the prior year was driven by the recovery in the second through the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year the change in revenue across our principal regional markets were north america increased 1326 million europe increased 6119 million asiapacific increased 2927 million and latin america increased 207 million in north america improved organic revenue growth in the united states and canada was partially offset by a decrease in revenue resulting from the disposition of icon in the second quarter of 2021 the united states experienced organic revenue growth in all disciplines led by our advertising discipline on the strength of our media business and our precision marketing and public relations disciplines in europe organic revenue increased in substantially all countries and disciplines especially our advertising discipline which was led by our media business and our experiential precision marketing and commerce and brand consulting disciplines the strengthening of the british pound and the euro against the us dollar contributed to increased revenue in the region in latin america organic revenue growth in all countries in the region especially brazil colombia and chile primarily in our advertising discipline was partially offset by the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar in asiapacific revenue increased due to strong organic revenue growth in substantially all countries particularly china australia india new zealand and japan and in all disciplines the strengthening of substantially all currencies against the us dollar contributed to increased revenue in the region the increases in revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 in our fundamental disciplines were advertising 4479 million precision marketing 2502 million commerce and brand consulting 889 million experiential 1191 million execution  support 653 million public relations 808 million and healthcare 661 million 

we measure cost of services in two distinct categories salary and service costs and occupancy and other costs as a service business salary and service costs make up the significant portion of our operating expenses and substantially all these costs comprise the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services salary and service costs include employee compensation and benefits freelance labor and thirdparty service costs which primarily include thirdparty supplier costs when we act as principal in providing services to our clients and clientrelated travel costs occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the delivery of our services including office rent and other occupancy costs equipment rent technology costs general office expenses and other expenses 

in 2021 operating expenses increased 5192 million or 45 yearoveryear operating expenses for 2021 reflect a reduction of 505 million related to the gain from the sale of icon and the prior year included an increase of 2779 million related to charges we recorded in the second quarter of 2020 in connection with the actions we took in response to the covid19 pandemic salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue increased 8292 million or 87 compared to 2020 reflecting increases in salary and related service costs which include an increase in freelance labor costs and thirdparty service costs of 7201 million and 1091 million respectively these increases primarily resulted from the increase in organic revenue as well as the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the us dollar especially the british pound and euro the prior year reflects a reduction in salary and service costs of 1626 million related to reimbursements under pandemic relief government programs in several countries as well as an increase of 558 million related to asset impairment charges occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs increased 97 million or 09 in 2021 as compared to 2020 operating profit increased 5991 million to 21979 million operating margin increased to 154 from 121 and ebita margin increased to 159 from 128 the increases in operating profit operating margin and ebita margin reflect the positive impact of organic revenue growth the positive impact of cost reduction actions taken in the prior year in response to the covid19 pandemic and the negative impact in the prior year from the net increase in operating expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2020 aggregating 1711 million related to the covid19 repositioning costs and asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 partially offset by the benefit of 1626 million related to reimbursements under pandemic relief government programs additionally operating profit operating margin and ebita margin for 2021 were favorably impacted by the 505 million gain recorded in connection with the sale of icon 

looking ahead to 2022 we expect organic revenue growth to be between 5 and 6 additionally we expect certain operating costs such as travel and general office expenses to continue to increase to normal levels as more of our workforce returns to the office we believe we can offset the impact of these increases by managing other discretionary costs as well as certain infrastructure costs accordingly for the full year 2022 we believe we will be able to maintain the operating margins we achieved in 2021 

sga expenses increased slightly yearoveryear sga expenses primarily consist of thirdparty marketing costs professional fees and compensation and benefits and occupancy and other costs of our corporate and executive offices which includes groupwide finance and accounting treasury legal and governance human resource oversight and similar costs 

in 2021 net interest expense increased 196 million yearoveryear to 2091 million interest expense on debt in 2021 increased 136 million to 2132 million compared to 2020 primarily arising from a loss of 266 million on the early redemption in may 2021 of all the outstanding 125 billion of our 3625 senior notes due 2022 or 2022 notes which was partially offset by the benefit from the issuance of 800 million of our 260 senior notes due 2031 or 2031 notes at a lower rate interest income in 2021 decreased 50 million yearoveryear to 273 million primarily due to lower rates 

our effective tax rate for 2021 decreased yearoveryear to 246 from 271 in connection with the sale of icon in the second quarter of 2021 we recorded a pretax gain of 505 million the lower effective tax rate for 2021 was predominantly the result of 328 million favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain domestic jurisdictions as well as a nominal tax applied against the book gain on the sale of icon resulting from excess tax over book basis the effective tax rate for 2020 reflects an increase due to the nondeductibility in certain jurisdictions of a portion of the covid19 repositioning charges recorded in the second quarter of 2020 

net income  omnicom group inc in 2021 increased 4624 million to 14078 million from 9454 million in 2020 the yearoveryear increase is due to the factors described above diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc increased to 653 in 2021 compared to 437 in 2020 due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the resumption of repurchases of our common stock during the year net of shares issued for restricted stock awards stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan during the year 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes including note 2 for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap and are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our equity method investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill 

we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions the evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation geographic coverage competitive position and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach or their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the assets we acquire are intangible assets primarily consisting of the knowhow of the personnel which is treated as part of goodwill and is not required to be valued separately under us gaap for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets that are required to be valued separately a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable under fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to the goodwill impairment test we performed the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill in june 2021 we combined certain practice areas into a new reporting unit and assigned a segment manager primarily responsible for the omnicom public relations group as a result the number of operating segments increased from five to six we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our six global agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our key client matrix organization structure for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting 

units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and in fasb asc topic 350 consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and occupancy and other costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our virtual client network strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions 

we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units’ cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” for each reporting unit 

at june 30 2021 we adjusted our assumptions to reflect the economic conditions in light of the impact on our business related to the covid19 pandemic the assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june 30 2021 and 2020 were 

long term growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in for the past ten years the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the average nominal gdp or ngdp growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was approximately 32 and 34  respectively we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2021 and included in the 10year history is the full year 2020 that reflects the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to ngdp based on our historical performance we also believe that our longterm growth rate will exceed ngdp growth in the markets we operate in which are similar across our reporting units accordingly for our annual test as of june 30 2021 we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 35 

when performing the annual impairment test as of june 30 2021 and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2021 in the first half of 2021 our revenue increased 100 which excluded our net disposition activity and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates 

the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 

our six reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining three agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt finally the allocation of goodwill when components are transferred between reporting units is based on relative fair value at the time of transfer 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion 

based on the results of our impairment test we concluded that our goodwill at june 30 2021 was not impaired because the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its respective net book value for our reporting units with negative book value we concluded that the fair value of their total assets was in excess of book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail the goodwill impairment test was approximately 34 notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used for wacc and longterm growth rate in our impairment testing were reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june 30 2021 revealed that if the wacc increased by 1 andor the longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be in excess of its respective net book value and would pass the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test each year at june 30th unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test there were no events through december 31 2021 that would change our impairment assessment the estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be significant a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 2 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services the performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services the transaction price we measure revenue by estimating the transaction price based on the consideration specified in the client arrangement revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied our revenue is primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising communications and marketing services in the following fundamental disciplines advertising precision marketing commerce  brand consulting experiential execution  support public relations and healthcare our client contracts are primarily fees for service on a rate per hour or per project basis revenue is recorded net of sales use and value added taxes 

performance obligations in substantially all our disciplines the performance obligation is to provide advisory and consulting services at an agreedupon level of effort to accomplish the specified engagement our client contracts are comprised of diverse arrangements involving fees based on any one or a combination of the following an agreed fee or rate per hour for the level of effort expended by our employees commissions based on the client’s spending for media purchased from third parties qualitative or quantitative incentive provisions specified in the contract and reimbursement for thirdparty costs that we are required to include in revenue when we control the vendor services related to these costs and we act as principal the transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price and is recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation clients typically receive and consume the benefit of our services as they are performed substantially all our client contracts provide that we are compensated for services performed to date and allow for cancellation by either party on short notice typically 90 days without penalty 

generally our shortterm contracts which normally take 30 to 90 days to complete are performed by a single agency and consist of a single performance obligation as a result we do not consider the underlying services as separate or distinct performance obligations because our services are highly interrelated occur in close proximity and the integration of the various components of a marketing message is essential to overall service in certain of our longterm client contracts which have a term of up to one year the performance obligation is a standready obligation because we provide a constant level of similar services over the term of the contract in other longterm contracts when our services are not a standready obligation we consider our services distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation based on its standalone selling price including contracts for strategic media planning and buying services which are considered to be multiple performance obligations and we allocate the transaction price to each distinct service based on the staffing plan and the standalone selling price in substantially all of our creative services contracts we have distinct performance obligations for our services including certain creative services contracts where we act as an agent and arrange at the client’s direction for third parties to perform studio production efforts 

revenue recognition methods a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed because the client receives and consumes the benefit of our performance throughout the contract period or we create an asset with no alternative use and are contractually entitled to payment for our performance to date in the event the client terminates the contract for convenience for these client contracts other than when we have a standready obligation to perform services 

revenue is recognized over time using input measures that correspond to the level of staff effort expended to satisfy the performance obligation on a rate per hour or equivalent basis for client contracts when we have a standready obligation to perform services on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract typically for periods up to one year where the scope of these arrangements is broad and there are no significant gaps in performing the services we recognize revenue using a timebased measure resulting in a straightline revenue recognition from time to time there may be changes in the client service requirements during the term of a contract and the changes could be significant these changes are typically negotiated as new contracts covering the additional requirements and the associated costs as well as additional fees for the incremental work to be performed 

to a lesser extent for certain other contracts where our performance obligations are satisfied in phases we recognize revenue over time using certain output measures based on the measurement of the value transferred to the customer including milestones achieved where the transaction price or a portion of the transaction price is derived from commissions based on a percentage of purchased media from third parties the performance obligation is not satisfied until the media is run and we have an enforceable contract providing a right to payment accordingly revenue for commissions is recognized at a point in time typically when the media is run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor 

principal vs agent in substantially all our businesses we incur thirdparty costs on behalf of clients including direct costs and incidental or outofpocket costs thirdparty direct costs incurred in connection with the creation and delivery of advertising or marketing communication services include among others purchased media studio production services specialized talent including artists and other freelance labor event marketing supplies materials and services promotional items market research and thirdparty data and other related expenditures outofpocket costs include among others transportation hotel meals and telecommunication charges incurred by us in the course of providing our services billings related to outofpocket costs are included in revenue since we control the goods or services prior to delivery to the client 

however the inclusion of billings related to thirdparty direct costs in revenue depends on whether we act as a principal or as an agent in the client arrangement in most of our businesses including advertising which also includes studio production efforts and media planning and buying services public relations healthcare advertising and most of our experiential businesses we act as an agent and arrange at the client’s direction for third parties to perform certain services in these cases we do not control the goods or services prior to the transfer to the client as a result revenue is recorded net of these costs equal to the amount retained for our fee or commission 

in certain businesses we may act as principal when contracting for thirdparty services on behalf of our clients in our events business and most of our execution  support businesses including field marketing and certain specialty marketing businesses we act as principal because we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the client and we are responsible for providing the specified goods or services or we are responsible for directing and integrating thirdparty vendors to fulfill our performance obligation at the agreed upon contractual price in such arrangements we also take pricing risk under the terms of the client contract in certain specialty media buying businesses we act as principal when we control the buying process for the purchase of the media and contract directly with the media vendor in these arrangements we assume the pricing risk under the terms of the client contract when we act as principal we include billable amounts related to thirdparty costs in the transaction price and record revenue over time at the gross amount billed including outofpocket costs consistent with the manner that we recognize revenue for the underlying services contract however in media buying contracts where we act as principal we recognize revenue at a point in time typically when the media is run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor 

variable consideration some of our client arrangements include variable consideration provisions which include performance incentives tiered commission structures and vendor rebates in certain markets outside of the united states variable consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method or the most likely outcome method these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and other factors known at the time performance incentives are typically recognized in revenue over time variable consideration for our media businesses in certain international markets includes rebate revenue and is recognized when it is probable that the media will be run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client in addition when we receive rebates or credits from vendors for transactions entered into on behalf of clients they are remitted to the clients in accordance with contractual requirements or retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned typically when the media is run

nongaap financial measures 

we use ebita and ebita margin as additional operating performance measures that exclude the noncash amortization expense of intangible assets which primarily consists of amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions we define ebita as earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets and ebita margin as ebita divided by revenue ebita and ebita margin are nongaap financial measures we believe that ebita and ebita margin are useful measures for investors to evaluate the performance of our business nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

the following table reconciles the us gaap financial measure of net income  omnicom group inc to ebita and ebita margin for the periods presented in millions 

revenue 

in 2021 our revenue increased 11183 million or 85 compared to 2020 changes in foreign exchange rates increased revenue 22 acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced revenue 39 and organic growth increased revenue 102 the reduction in acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reflects the sale of icon in the second quarter of 2021 in 2021 our business experienced a recovery from the negative effects of the covid19 pandemic in all our disciplines and regional markets as compared to 2020 the negative effects from the pandemic did not significantly impact our major markets and businesses until late in the first quarter of 2020 as a result the improvement in revenue in 2021 versus the prior year was driven by the recovery in the second third and fourth quarters of 2021 as compared to the prior year the change in revenue across our principal regional markets were north america increased 1326 million europe increased 6119 million asiapacific increased 2927 million and latin america increased 207 million in north america improved organic revenue growth in the united states and canada was partially offset by a decrease in revenue resulting from the disposition of icon in the second quarter of 2021 the united states experienced organic revenue growth in all disciplines led by our advertising discipline on the strength of our media business and our precision marketing and public relations disciplines in europe organic revenue increased in substantially all countries and disciplines especially our advertising discipline which was led by our media business and our experiential precision marketing and commerce and brand consulting disciplines the strengthening of the british pound and the euro against the us dollar contributed to increased revenue in the region in latin america organic revenue growth in all countries in the region especially brazil colombia and chile primarily in our advertising discipline was partially offset by the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar in asiapacific revenue increased due to strong organic revenue growth in substantially all countries particularly china australia india new zealand and japan and in all disciplines the strengthening of substantially all currencies against the us dollar contributed to increased revenue in the region the increases in revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 in our fundamental disciplines were advertising 4479 million precision marketing 2502 million commerce and brand consulting 889 million experiential 1191 million execution  support 653 million public relations 808 million and healthcare 661 million 

the components of revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 

the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

• the foreign exchange impact is calculated by translating the current period’s local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue in this case 140012 million for the total column the foreign exchange impact is the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period constant currency revenue 142894 million less 140012 million for the total column 

• acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date as a result acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition is attributed to organic growth disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of dispositions through the disposition date the acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the table 

• organic growth is calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact and the acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue components from total revenue growth 

• the percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component 131711 million for the total column 

changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized assuming exchange rates at february 4 2022 remain unchanged we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce revenue in 2022 by approximately 20 for the first quarter and 15 for the year in addition for the full year 2022 based on acquisition and disposition activity to date we expect the effect of net acquisition and disposition activity to reduce revenue by approximately 30 to 35 and organic revenue growth to be between 5 and 6 

revenue and organic growth in our geographic markets were in millions 

revenue in europe which includes our primary markets of the uk and the euro zone increased 6119 million in 2021 compared to 2020 revenue in the uk representing 106 of revenue increased 2377 million revenue in continental europe which comprises the euro zone and the other european countries representing 189 of revenue increased 3742 million the increase in revenue is due to strong organic growth in all countries and disciplines as well as the strengthening of the british pound and euro against the us dollar 

in the normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors in 2021 we had an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients in 2021 and 2020 our largest client represented 32 and 34 of revenue respectively our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 217 and 536 of revenue for 2021 respectively and 208 and 540 of revenue for 2020 respectively 

to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following categories advertising precision marketing commerce  brand consulting experiential execution  support public relations and healthcare 

certain of our business and markets experienced a slower improvement in 2021 from the effects of client spending reductions in 2020 related to the covid19 pandemic among the most negatively impacted businesses in 2020 were our experiential discipline primarily in our event marketing businesses and our execution  support discipline primarily in our field marketing businesses

operating expenses 

operating expenses were in millions 

in 2021 operating expenses increased 5192 million or 45 yearoveryear operating expenses for 2021 reflect a reduction of 505 million related to the gain from the sale of icon and the prior year included an increase of 2779 million related to charges we recorded in the second quarter of 2020 in connection with the actions we took in response to the covid19 pandemic salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue increased 8292 million or 87 compared to 2020 reflecting increases in salary and related service costs which include an increase in freelance labor costs and thirdparty service costs of 7201 million and 1091 million respectively these increases primarily resulted from the increase in organic revenue as well as the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the us dollar especially the british pound and euro the prior year reflects a reduction in salary and service costs of 1626 million related to reimbursements under pandemic relief government programs in several countries as well as an increase of 558 million related to asset impairment charges occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs increased 97 million or 09 in 2021 as compared to 2020 operating profit increased 5991 million to 21979 million operating margin increased to 154 

from 121 and ebita margin increased to 159 from 128 the increases in operating profit operating margin and ebita margin reflect the positive impact of organic revenue growth the positive impact of cost reduction actions taken in the prior year in response to the covid19 pandemic and the negative impact in the prior year from the net increase in operating expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2020 aggregating 1711 million related to the covid19 repositioning costs and asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 partially offset by the benefit of 1626 million related to reimbursements under pandemic relief government programs additionally operating profit operating margin and ebita margin for 2021 were favorably impacted by the 505 million gain recorded in connection with the sale of icon 

looking ahead to 2022 we expect certain operating costs such as travel and general office expenses to continue to increase to normal levels as more of our workforce returns to the office we believe we can offset the impact of these increases by managing other discretionary costs as well as certain infrastructure costs accordingly for the full year 2022 we believe we will be able to maintain the operating margins we achieved in 2021 

net interest expense 

in 2021 net interest expense increased 196 million yearoveryear to 2091 million interest expense on debt in 2021 increased 136 million to 2132 million compared to 2020 primarily arising from a loss of 266 million on the early redemption in may 2021 of all the outstanding 125 billion of the 3625 senior notes due 2022 or 2022 notes which was partially offset by the benefit from the issuance of 800 million of the 260 senior notes due 2031 or 2031 notes at a lower rate interest income in 2021 decreased 50 million yearoveryear to 273 million primarily due to lower rates 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2021 decreased yearoveryear to 246 from 271 in connection with the sale of icon in the second quarter of 2021 we recorded a pretax gain of 505 million the lower effective tax rate for 2021 was predominantly the result of 328 million favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain domestic jurisdictions as well as a nominal tax applied against the book gain on the sale of icon resulting from excess tax over book basis the effective tax rate for 2020 reflects an increase due to the nondeductibility in certain jurisdictions of a portion of the covid19 repositioning charges recorded in the second quarter of 2020 for 2022 we expect our effective tax rate to be between 265 and 27 before the effect if any from the tax impact of our equity compensation 

net income and net income per share  omnicom group inc 

net income  omnicom group inc in 2021 increased 4624 million to 14078 million from 9454 million in 2020 the yearoveryear increase is due to the factors described above diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc increased to 653 in 2021 compared to 437 in 2020 due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the resumption of repurchases of our common stock during the year net of shares issued for restricted stock awards stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan during the year 

the combined effect of the aftertax gain from the sale of icon and the loss on the early redemption of the 2022 notes increased net income  omnicom group inc for 2021 by 310 million in 2020 the net aftertax effect on net income  omnicom group inc from the covid19 repositioning costs and asset impairment charges was a decrease of 2702 million which was partially offset by a net aftertax increase in net income  omnicom group inc from reimbursements under government programs of 1234 million

changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized 

revenue and organic growth in our geographic markets were in millions 

revenue in europe which includes our primary markets of the uk and the euro zone decreased 4997 million in 2020 as compared to the prior year revenue in the uk representing 97 of total revenue decreased 1515 million revenue in continental europe which comprises the euro zone and the other european countries representing 177 of total revenue decreased 3482 million the decrease in revenue is due to negative organic growth resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

in the normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients in 2020 and 2019 our largest client represented 34 and 30 of revenue respectively our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 208 and 540 of revenue in 2020 respectively and 196 and 513 of revenue in 2019 respectively 

all our business experienced the effects from client spending reductions related to the covid19 pandemic the spending reductions impacted all our disciplines and markets the most significantly impacted were our advertising discipline our experiential discipline especially in our event marketing businesses and our execution  support discipline primarily in our field marketing and merchandising businesses our public relations discipline was less significantly impacted and our healthcare and precision marketing disciplines performed well revenue and organic growth by discipline were in millions 

we provide services to clients that operate in various industry sectors revenue by sector was 

in 2020 certain industry sectors were more negatively affected by the impact of the covid19 pandemic than others 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 were in millions 

in 2020 salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue decreased 13994 million or 128 compared to 2019 salary and related service costs in 2020 decreased 6443 million or 93 yearoveryear primarily as a result of the severance and furlough actions we took in the second quarter of 2020 partially offset by asset impairment charges of 558 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 also during 2020 we reduced salary and service costs by 1626 million related to reimbursements under government programs in several countries thirdparty service costs which include expenses incurred with thirdparty vendors primarily when we act as a principal when performing services for our clients decreased 7551 million or 185 yearoveryear reflecting the decrease in revenue and the impact of the actions we took to align our cost structure occupancy and other costs decreased 833 million or 68 in 2020 as compared to 2019 operating profit decreased 5235 million to 15988 million operating margin decreased 121 from 142 and ebita margin decreased to 128 from 148 yearoveryear in 2020 operating profit operating margin and ebita margin included a net decrease aggregating 1711 million related to the covid19 repositioning costs recorded in the second quarter and asset impairment charges of 558 million in the fourth quarter which are included in salary and service costs partially offset by an increase related to pandemic relief reimbursements under government programs in several countries during the year 

net interest expense 

in 2020 net interest expense increased 55 million yearoveryear to 1895 million interest expense on debt decreased 276 million to 1996 million primarily reflecting a reduction in interest expense from refinancing activity at lower interest rates in the second half of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 partially offset by a loss of 77 million on the early redemption of the remaining 600 million principal amount of the 445 senior notes due 2020 in march 2020 and the interest expense from the issuance of the 420 senior notes due 2030 in april 2020 interest income in 2020 decreased 280 million yearoveryear to 323 million primarily due to lower interest rates 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2020 increased yearoveryear to 271 from 260 in 2019 the nondeductibility in certain jurisdictions of a portion of the covid19 repositioning costs recorded in the second quarter of 2020 had the effect of increasing our effective tax rate for 2020 this increase was substantially offset by a lower effective tax rate on our foreign earnings resulting from a change in legislation in 2019 income tax expense was reduced by 108 million primarily from the net favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions after considering these items our effective rate for 2020 would have approximated the rate for 2019 

net income and net income per share  omnicom group inc 

net income  omnicom group inc in 2020 decreased 3937 million to 9454 million from 13391 million in 2019 the yearoveryear decrease is due to the factors described above diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc decreased to 437 in 2020 compared to 606 in 2019 due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock through march 2020 net of shares issued for restricted stock awards stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan as discussed above our results of operations for 2020 included covid19 repositioning costs and asset impairment charges which were partially offset by an increase attributable to pandemic relief reimbursements under government programs in several countries the aftertax affect of these items on net income  omnicom group inc was 1468 million 

the impact on net income omnicom group inc of these actions was in millions 



liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements 

our primary shortterm liquidity sources are our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents additional liquidity sources include our 25 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility or credit facility maturing on february 14 2025 uncommitted credit lines aggregating 8639 million the ability to issue up to 2 billion of commercial paper and access to the capital markets our liquidity sources fund our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending 

working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement our typical working capital cycle results in a shortterm funding requirement that normally peaks during the second quarter of the year due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations in addition we have contractual obligations related to our longterm debt principal and interest payments recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations and contingent purchase price obligations earnouts from acquisitions our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend payments to common shareholders capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 decreased 2837 million from december 31 2020 the components of the decrease were in millions 



principal cash sources and principal cash uses are nongaap liquidity measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful to understand the primary sources and uses of our cash flow and the effect on our cash and cash equivalents nongaap liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2021 we have the following contractual obligations 

• principal payments on longterm debt of 57 billion of which 750 million is due in 2024 and 14 billion is due in 2026 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements depending on the conditions in the credit markets we may refinance this debt or we may use cash from operations including temporally accessing our credit facility to repay this debt 

• interest payments on longterm debt due within the next five years aggregate 7126 million of which 1615 million is payable in 2022 

• the liability for minimum lease payments for operating and finance leases due within the next five years aggregate 10132 million of which 3100 million is due in 2022 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

• the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was 2894 million and the liability for our postemployment arrangements was 1530 million in 2021 we contributed 64 million to our defined benefit plans and paid 95 million for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2022 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

• the liability for contingent purchase price payments earnouts was 1671 million of which 431 million is payable in 2022 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

• the liability for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings due in the next five years is 1004 million of which 116 million is payable in 2022 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our nondiscretionary cash requirements for the next twelve months and that the availability of our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our longterm liquidity requirements 

cash management 

our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia manage our cash and liquidity each day operations with excess funds invest those funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center treasury centers with excess cash invest on a shortterm basis with third parties generally with maturities ranging from overnight to less than 90 days certain treasury centers have notional pooling arrangements that are used to manage their cash and setoff foreign exchange imbalances the arrangements require each treasury center to have its own notional pool account and to maintain a notional positive account balance additionally under the terms of the arrangement setoff of foreign exchange positions are limited to the long and short positions within their own account to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to issue up to a total of 2 billion of us dollardenominated commercial paper or borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines this process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as manage our risk to foreign exchange rate imbalances in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines we have a policy governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each institution in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the credit facility these institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

at december 31 2021 our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 24 billion of our total cash and cash equivalents of 53 billion most of the cash is available to us net of any foreign withholding taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states 

at december 31 2021 our net debt position which we define as total debt including shortterm debt less cash and cash equivalents increased 1678 million as compared to december 31 2020 the increase in net debt primarily resulted from the excess of principal cash uses over principal cash sources of 3065 million partially offset by the reduction in debt that had increased in 2020 as a result of the liquidity actions we took in response to the covid19 pandemic 

the components of net debt were in millions 

net debt is a nongaap liquidity measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap liquidity measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management nongaap liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies

the 245 senior notes due 2030 the 420 senior notes due 2030 and the 260 senior notes due 2031 are senior unsecured obligations of omnicom that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

omnicom and its wholly owned finance subsidiary omnicom capital inc or oci are coobligors under the 365 senior notes due 2024 and the 360 senior notes due 2026 these notes are a joint and several liability of omnicom and oci and omnicom unconditionally guarantees oci’s obligations with respect to the notes oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci’s assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of oci or omnicom to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances such notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness

the credit facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash charges of no more than 35 times for the most recently ended 12month period in october 2020 we amended the credit facility to increase the maximum leverage ratio to 40 times through december 31 2021 at december 31 2021 we were in compliance with this covenant as our leverage ratio was 23 times the credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 

borrowings under the credit facility may use libor as the benchmark interest rate the libor benchmark rate is expected to be phased out by the end of june 2023 we do not expect that the discontinuation of the libor rate will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations 

at december 31 2021 our longterm and shortterm debt was rated bbb and a2 by sp and baa1 and p2 by moodys our access to the commercial paper market and the cost of these borrowings are affected by market conditions and our credit ratings the longterm debt indentures and the credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings 

credit markets and availability of credit 

in light of the uncertainty of future economic conditions we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and we will continue to manage our discretionary expenditures we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients we believe that these actions in addition to the availability of our credit facility are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital needs and our discretionary spending note 7 to the consolidated financial statements provides information regarding our credit facility 

we have typically funded our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and continuing through 2021 we substantially reduced our commercial paper issuances as compared to prior years additional liquidity sources include our credit facility and the uncommitted credit lines 

commercial paper activity was dollars in millions 

we expect to continue issuing commercial paper to fund our daytoday liquidity when needed however disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads to mitigate any disruption in the credit markets and to fund our liquidity we may borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines or access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist we will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any disruptions in the credit markets in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk through various strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes using derivatives exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations we manage that risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivatives we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivatives by performing a valueatrisk or var analysis var is a statistical model that uses historical currency exchange rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 95 confidence a maximum oneday change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2021 was not significant 

foreign currency exchange risk 

in 2021 our international operations represented approximately 49 of our revenue changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized the effects of foreign currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone the uk australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies as an integral part of our global treasury operations we centralize our cash and use notional multicurrency pools to manage the foreign currency exchange risk that arises from imbalances between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers in addition there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts to manage this risk at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 773 million and 1696 million respectively at december 31 2021 and 2020 the net fair value of the forward foreign contracts was not material see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency derivatives are designated as economic hedges therefore any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposure by using these financial instruments we reduce financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain which might occur if the markets move favorably the terms of our forward foreign exchange contracts are generally less than 90 days 

interest rate risk 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt during 2021 there were no interest rate swaps and at december 31 2021 longterm debt consisted entirely of fixedrate debt 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients that operate in nearly every sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client represented 32 of revenue in 2021 however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a 

disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be insufficient less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn

 item 1 business 

our business 

omnicom is a strategic holding company providing advertising marketing and corporate communications services to clients through our branded networks and agencies around the world we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against other global national and regional advertising and marketing services companies as well as technology social media and professional services companies the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and media has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to global service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing services designed to optimize their total marketing expenditure as discussed below in 2020 the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our business 

on a global panregional and local basis our networks and agencies provide a comprehensive range of services in the following fundamental disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm which includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations and healthcare advertising includes creative services as well as strategic media planning and buying and data analytics services crm consumer experience includes omnicom’s precision marketing group and digitaldirect agencies as well as our branding shopper marketing and experiential marketing agencies crm execution  support includes field marketing sales support merchandising and point of sale as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services public relations services include corporate communications crisis management public affairs and media and media relations services healthcare includes advertising and media services to global healthcare clients our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients our fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model requires that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure this collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and comprehensive manner we use our clientcentric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing clients moving into new markets and obtaining new clients in addition to collaborating through our client service models our agencies and networks collaborate across internally developed technology platforms annalect our proprietary data and analytics platform serves as the strategic resource for all of our agencies and networks to share when developing client service strategies across our virtual networks omni our peoplebased precision marketing and insights platform identifies and defines personalized consumer experiences at scale across creative media and crm as well as other disciplines 

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives our service offerings include 





certain business trends had positively impacted our business and industry these trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they continue to consolidate their business within one or a small number of service providers in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points we have structured our business around these trends we believe that our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions provides a competitive advantage to our business in the past and we expect this to continue over the medium and long term our key client matrix organization structure facilitates superior client management and allows for greater integration of the services required by the world’s largest brands our overarching strategy is to continue to use our virtual client networks to grow our business relationships with our largest clients by serving them across our networks disciplines and geographies 

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our business and results of operations efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic including government actions to restrict travel limit public gatherings shelterinplace orders and mandatory closures of businesses resulted in many of our clients reducing or suspending their spending for our advertising marketing and corporate communication services as a result for the year ended december 31 2020 revenue decreased 119 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic we anticipate that the negative impact from the pandemic on our revenue will continue through the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year period however we expect organic revenue growth for the first half of 2021 the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our revenue has been and may continue to be material depending on several factors including the potential for prolonged or additional governmental actions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic it is possible that the covid19 pandemic will accelerate certain trends that began prepandemic particularly those relating to online commerce brand building and how we deploy our personnel we expect that some of these trends will benefit our agencies and provide revenue growth opportunities as well as increasing flexibility with respect to our use of physical locations and our cost structure but some trends may negatively affect us including potential disruption by new participants and technologies see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or mda of this report 

we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities as well as to identify nonstrategic or underperforming businesses for disposition for information about our acquisitions and dispositions see mda  acquisitions and goodwill and notes 5 and 13 respectively to the consolidated financial statements none of our acquisitions or dispositions individually or in the aggregate was material to our results of operations or financial position in the three years ended december 31 2020 

the various components of our business including revenue by discipline and geographic area and material factors that affected us in 2020 are discussed in the mda 

our clients 

our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy in many cases multiple agencies or networks serve different brands product groups or both within the same client for example in 2020 our largest client represented 34 of revenue and was served by more than 110 of our agencies our 100 largest clients many of which represent the largest global marketers represented approximately 54 of revenue and were each served on average by more than 50 of our agencies 

government regulations

human capital resources 

our employees are our most important assets we believe a critical component to our success depends on the ability to attract develop and retain key personnel the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience whether through traditional channels or emerging digital platforms recognizing the importance of this core competency we support and develop our employees through training and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills 

human capital management strategies are developed collectively by senior management including the management teams of the company’s networks and practice areas and are overseen by the company’s board of directors we are committed to efforts that ensure that the workplace is equitable ethical fosters an inclusive work environment across our global workforce and respects human rights our human capital management priorities include among other things providing competitive wages and benefits succession planning promoting diversity and inclusion and adopting codes of conduct and business ethics to be implemented throughout the company

 item 1a risk factors 

economic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business results of operations and financial position and could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position in the future 

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our business results of operations and financial position most of our clients businesses were negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic as long as the covid19 pandemic remains a threat global economic conditions will continue to be volatile and such uncertainty cuts across all clients industries and geographies demand for our services can be expected to continue to be adversely affected as marketers reduce expenditures in the short term due to the uncertain impact of the pandemic on the global economy the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business will depend on numerous factors that we are not able to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic government actions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and the intermediate and longterm impact of the pandemic on marketers spending plans 

adverse economic conditions a reduction in client spending a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

economic conditions have a direct impact on our business results of operations and financial position adverse global or regional economic conditions including those caused by the covid19 pandemic pose a risk that clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue which would adversely affect our business results of operations and 

financial position a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements in addition a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements which may not be available on favorable terms or at all even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital such actions may not be effective 

in an economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 

business and operational risks 

clients periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive industry key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently particularly large multinational clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

as a service business our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in 2020 our 100 largest clients represented approximately 54 of our revenue clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process store and transmit data summarize results manage our business and maintain client advertising and marketing information increased cybersecurity threats and attacks which are constantly evolving pose a risk to our systems and networks for example in february 2021 we experienced a cybersecurity incident that resulted in the disruption of certain of our information technology systems at one of our networks based on the information currently known and our investigation to date we do not believe the incident will have a material impact on our business operations or financial results however cybersecurity threats and attacks in the future could be material security breaches improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public we also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations our systems and processes to protect against detect prevent respond to and mitigate cybersecurity incidents and our organizational training for employees to develop an understanding of cybersecurity risks and threats may be unable to prevent material security breaches theft modification or loss of data employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats such events could adversely affect our business and reputation we also use thirdparty service providers including cloud providers to store transmit and process data these thirdparty service providers could also be subject to cybersecurity incidents that could adversely affect us 

in addition in 2020 and continuing into 2021 the overwhelming majority of our workforce temporarily transitioned to working from home during the covid19 pandemic the increase in the number of our employees working from home may increase certain business and procedural control risks including increased risk of cybersecurity incidents and exposure of sensitive business and client advertising and marketing information as well as personal data or information 

risks related to international operations 

currency exchange rate fluctuations have impacted and in the future could impact our business results of operations and financial position 

in 2020 our international operations represented approximately 45 of our revenue we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone the united kingdom or the uk australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly their financial statements are translated into us dollars as a result both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our business results of operations and financial position in addition funds transferred to the united states can be adversely or beneficially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in highgrowth markets and developing countries which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions competition for new business and staff currency exchange rate fluctuations political conditions differing regulatory environments and other risks associated with extensive international operations in addition we conduct business in numerous highgrowth markets and developing countries that tend to have longer billing collection cycles currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped vague inconsistently enforced retroactively applied or frequently changed the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally our operations are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and stringent and any violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation for financial information by geographic region see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have substantial operations in the uk and the euro zone on december 31 2020 the uk completed its separation from the european union or eu commonly referred to as “brexit” and entered into an agreement or brexit agreement with the eu that defines the terms of their relationship covering among other things trade and tariffs services and travel the uncertainties related to the impact of the brexit agreement have crossborder operational financial and tax implications among others and any economic volatility that may arise in the uk the eu or elsewhere may adversely affect our business 

risks related to acquisitions 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the process we conduct business legal and financial due diligence to identify and evaluate material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our business results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized knowhow of the acquired workforce as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at june 30 and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

regulatory risks 

government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs such regulation may seek among other things to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and a number of international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising media these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

our businesses could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by laws and regulations aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change specifically these companies may seek to pass their increased costs through to their customers further if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements either directly or indirectly their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs therefore at this time we cannot estimate what impact such regulations may have on our business results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our business and results of operations efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic including government actions to restrict travel limit public gatherings shelterinplace orders and mandatory closures of businesses resulted in many of our clients reducing or suspending their spending for our advertising marketing and corporate communication services as a result for the year ended december 31 2020 revenue decreased 17826 million or 119 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic we anticipate that the negative impact from the pandemic on our revenue will continue through the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year period however we expect organic revenue growth for the first half of 2021 the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our revenue has been and may continue to be material depending on several factors including the potential for prolonged or additional governmental actions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic it is possible that the covid19 pandemic will accelerate certain trends that began prepandemic particularly those relating to online commerce brand building and how we deploy our personnel we expect that some of these trends will benefit our agencies and provide revenue growth opportunities as well as increasing flexibility with respect to our use of physical locations and our cost structure but some trends may negatively affect us including potential disruption by new participants and technologies 

in response to the impact of the covid19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020 we took actions to align our cost structure and reduce our workforce and facility requirements and continued the review of businesses for disposal and assets for impairment as a result we recorded a pretax charge of 2779 million which is comprised of incremental severance of 1500 million real estate operating lease rightofuse or rou asset and other asset impairment charges of 558 million other exit costs of 470 million and dispositions and other charges of 251 million see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements these actions reduced headcount by over 6000 and reduced the related facility requirements which should result in significant reductions in future operating expenses 

in addition during 2020 we reduced salary and service costs by 1626 million related to reimbursements and tax credits under government programs in several countries including the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act or the cares act in the united states the kurzarbeit program in germany and other government reimbursement programs in the uk france canada and other jurisdictions see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements further in the fourth quarter of 2020 we recorded asset impairment charges of 558 million associated with underperforming assets which is included in salary and service costs 

the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted most of our clients businesses as a result clients have cut costs including postponing or reducing marketing communication expenditures while certain industries such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals technology and telecommunications financial services and consumer products have been less affected as long as the covid19 

pandemic remains a threat global economic conditions continue to be volatile and such uncertainty cuts across all clients industries and geographies overall while we have a diversified portfolio of service offerings clients and geographies demand for our services can be expected to continue to be adversely affected as marketers reduce expenditures in the short term due to the uncertain impact of the pandemic on the global economy we expect global economic performance and our performance to vary by geography until the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy moderates 

although we have experienced a decrease in our cash flow from operating activities we took numerous proactive steps to strengthen our liquidity and financial position that are intended to mitigate the potential impact of the covid19 pandemic on our liquidity in february 2020 we issued 600 million 245 senior notes due april 30 2030 or the 245 notes in march 2020 the net proceeds from the issuance of the 245 notes were used to redeem the remaining 600 million principal amount of our 445 senior notes due august 15 2020 or the 2020 notes as a result we have no notes maturing until may 2022 in april 2020 we issued 600 million of 420 senior notes due june 1 2030 or the 420 notes and we entered into a new 400 million 364 day revolving credit facility or the 364 day credit facility the 364 day credit facility is in addition to our existing 25 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility or credit facility which we extended to mature in february 2025 in addition in march 2020 we suspended our share repurchase activity 

results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 

we are a strategic holding company providing advertising marketing and corporate communications services to clients through our branded networks and agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our networks and agencies provide a comprehensive range of services in the following fundamental disciplines advertising crm which includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations and healthcare our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our networks and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients our fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model requires that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure this collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and comprehensive manner we use our clientcentric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing clients moving into new markets and obtaining new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or could serve our existing clients 

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets and have a large and diverse client base in 2020 our largest client represented 34 of revenue and our 100 largest clients which represent many of the worlds major marketers represented approximately 54 of revenue our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy with no one industry representing more than 16 of our revenue in 2020 although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance adverse global or regional economic conditions such as those currently arising from the covid19 pandemic pose a risk that our clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services which would reduce the demand for our services revenue is typically lower in the first and third quarters a nd higher i n the second and fourth quarters reflecting client spending patterns during the year and additional project work that usually occurs in the fourth quarter as a result of the impact related to the covid19 pandemic we experienced a significant decline in our yearoveryear organic revenue growth in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 which will likely continue at least through the first half of 2021 we anticipate that the negative impact from the pandemic on our revenue will continue through the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year period however we expect organic revenue growth for the first half of 2021 

in 2020 revenue decreased 17826 million or 119 compared to 2019 changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue 609 million or 04 acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced revenue 567 million or 04 reflecting the disposition of certain nonstrategic businesses and organic growth reduced revenue 16650 million or 111 

certain global events targeted by major marketers for advertising expenditures such as the fifa world cup and the olympics and certain national events such as the us election process may affect our revenue periodoverperiod in certain businesses typically these events do not have a significant impact on our revenue in any period 

beginning in march 2020 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2020 our business experienced the effects from reductions in client spending due to the impact related to the covid19 pandemic the spending reductions impacted all our businesses and markets the most significantly impacted businesses were our advertising discipline crm consumer experience discipline especially in our event marketing businesses and crm execution  support discipline primarily in our field marketing and merchandising businesses in north america we experienced a decline in organic revenue attributable to the covid19 pandemic in all our disciplines except healthcare in europe and the middle east and africa almost all businesses 

and regions experienced a decline in organic revenue resulting from the covid19 pandemic which was marginally offset by an increase primarily from the strengthening of the british pound and euro against the us dollar in addition the economic and political conditions in the uk and the eu resulting from the implementation of the brexit agreement remain uncertain and could negatively impact our businesses in the uk and the eu in latin america the impact of the covid19 pandemic compounded by the continuing unstable economic and political conditions in brazil resulted in negative organic growth in brazil and throughout the region in addition the weakening of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar in all countries further contributed to the reduction in revenue in the region in asiapacific almost all our businesses in the region experienced negative organic growth as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the weakening of most currencies against the us dollar had a marginal negative impact on revenue the economic and fiscal issues including the impact related to the covid19 pandemic facing the countries we operate in can be expected to continue to cause economic uncertainty and volatility however the impact on our business varies by country we monitor economic conditions closely as well as client revenue levels and other factors in response to reductions in our revenue that are expected to continue at least through the first half of 2021 beginning in the second quarter of 2020 we took actions to align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital however there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions reductions in client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective or that additional actions will not be necessary 

prior to the covid19 pandemic certain business trends generally had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have made it a practice to consolidate their business within one service provider in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points we have structured our business around these trends while the current economic environment caused many clients to reduce spending for our services certain trends such as increased spending on digital marketing platforms and our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions provide a competitive advantage to our business we expect this advantage to continue over the medium and long term 

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives these services include among others advertising brand consulting content marketing corporate social responsibility consulting crisis communications custom publishing data analytics database management digitaldirect marketing digital transformation entertainment marketing experiential marketing field marketing financialcorporate businesstobusiness advertising graphic artsdigital imaging healthcare marketing and communications instore design interactive marketing investor relations marketing research media planning and buying merchandising and point of sale mobile marketing multicultural marketing nonprofit marketing organizational communications package design product placement promotional marketing public affairs public relations retail marketing sales support search engine marketing shopper marketing social media marketing and sports and event marketing 

we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities as well as to identify nonstrategic or underperforming businesses for disposition in the first and second quarters of 2019 we disposed of certain businesses primarily in our crm execution  support discipline 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we focus on are revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by principal regional market and marketing discipline the impact from foreign currency exchange rate changes growth from acquisitions net of dispositions and growth from our largest clients operating expenses are comprised of cost of services selling general and administrative expenses or sga and depreciation and amortization 

in 2020 our revenue decreased 119 compared to 2019 changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue 04 acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced revenue 04 and organic growth decreased revenue 111 as all our markets were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic the change in revenue across our principal regional markets were north america decreased 106 europe decreased 122 asiapacific decreased 88 and latin america decreased 317 the change in revenue in 2020 compared to 2019 in our fundamental disciplines was advertising decreased 131 crm consumer experience decreased 156 crm execution  support decreased 167 public relations decreased 56 and healthcare increased 34 

we measure cost of services in two distinct categories salary and service costs and occupancy and other costs as a service business salary and service costs make up the significant portion of our operating expenses and substantially all these costs comprise the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services salary and service costs include employee compensation and benefits freelance labor and thirdparty service costs which include thirdparty supplier costs and clientrelated travel costs occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the delivery of our services including office rent and other occupancy costs equipment rent technology costs general office expenses and other expenses 

sga expenses which decreased yearoveryear primarily consist of thirdparty marketing costs professional fees and compensation and benefits and occupancy and other costs of our corporate and executive offices which includes groupwide finance and accounting treasury legal and governance human resource oversight and similar costs 

in 2020 salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue decreased 13994 million or 128 compared to 2019 salary and related service costs in 2020 decreased 6443 million or 93 yearoveryear primarily as a result of the severance and furlough actions we took in the second quarter of 2020 also during 2020 we reduced salary and service costs by 1626 million related to reimbursements and tax credits under government programs in several countries see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements thirdparty service costs which include expenses incurred with thirdparty vendors primarily when we act as a principal when performing services for our clients decreased 7551 million or 185 yearoveryear reflecting the decrease in revenue and the impact of actions we took to align our cost structure occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs decreased 833 million or 68 in 2020 as compared to 2019 operating profit decreased 5235 million to 15988 million operating margin decreased to 121 from 142 and ebita margin decreased to 128 from 148 yearoveryear in 2020 operating profit operating margin and ebita margin included a net decrease aggregating 1711 million related to the covid19 repositioning costs recorded in the second quarter and asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter partially offset by an increase related to reimbursements and tax credits under government programs in several countries see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2020 net interest expense increased 55 million yearoveryear to 1895 million interest expense on debt decreased 276 million to 1996 million primarily reflecting a reduction in interest expense from our refinancing activity at lower interest rates in the second half of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 partially offset by a loss of 77 million on the early redemption of the remaining 600 million principal amount of the 2020 notes in the first quarter of 2020 and the interest expense from the issuance of the 420 notes in april 2020 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements interest income in 2020 decreased 280 million yearoveryear to 323 million primarily due to lower rates 

our effective tax rate for 2020 increased yearoveryear to 271 from 260 the nondeductibility in certain jurisdictions of a portion of the covid19 repositioning costs recorded in the second quarter of 2020 had the effect of increasing our effective tax rate for 2020 this increase was substantially offset by a lower effective tax rate on our foreign earnings resulting from a change in legislation in 2019 income tax expense was reduced by 108 million primarily from the net favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions after considering these items our effective rate for 2020 would have approximated the rate for 2019 

net income  omnicom group inc in 2020 decreased 3937 million to 9454 million from 13391 million in 2019 the yearoveryear decrease is due to the factors described above diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc decreased to 437 in 2020 compared to 606 in 2019 due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock through march 2020 net of shares issued for restricted stock awards stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan during the year as discussed above and in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements our results of operations for 2020 included covid19 repositioning costs and asset impairment charges which were partially offset by an increase attributable to reimbursements and tax credits under government programs in several countries the aftertax impact of these items on net income  omnicom group inc was 1468 million 

critical accounting policies 

the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes including note 2 for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap and are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our equity method investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill 

the evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation geographic coverage competitive position and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic 

reach or their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the assets we acquire are intangible assets primarily consisting of the knowhow of the personnel which is treated as part of goodwill and is not required to be valued separately under us gaap for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets that are required to be valued separately a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable under fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to the goodwill impairment test we performed the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five global agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our key client matrix organization structure for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and in fasb asc topic 350 consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and occupancy and other costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our virtual client network strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions 

we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” for each reporting unit 

at june 30 2020 we adjusted our assumptions to reflect the economic conditions in light of the impact on our business related to the covid19 pandemic including downward adjustment to our revenue and earnings assumptions reducing our longterm growth rate and increasing the weighted average cost of capital or wacc for each reporting unit and limiting our estimate of our equity value to reflect the decline in our share price that occurred during the first half of 2020 in addition the assumptions reflected the expected cost reductions from our severance and real estate facility repositioning actions see notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june 30 2020 and 2019 were 



long term growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in for the past ten years the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the average nominal gdp or ngdp growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was approximately 42 and 43  respectively we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2020 and lowered it to reflect the potential future effects of the unprecedented covid19 pandemic on the global economy which are not reflected in the 10year historical analysis we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to ngdp based on our historical performance we also believe that our longterm growth rate will exceed ngdp growth in the markets we operate in which are similar across our reporting units for our annual test as of june 30 2020 we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 30 

when performing the annual impairment test as of june 30 2020 and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2020 in the first half of 2020 our revenue declined 117 which excluded our net disposition activity and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted the global economy government actions taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic negatively impacted many of our clients businesses and in turn clients have reduced their demand for our services in addition the assumptions reflected the expected cost reductions from our severance and real estate facility repositioning actions see notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 

our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion 

based on the results of our impairment test we concluded that our goodwill at june 30 2020 was not impaired because the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its respective net book value for our reporting units with negative book value we concluded that the fair value of their total assets was in excess of book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail the goodwill impairment test was approximately 20 notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used for wacc and longterm growth rate in our impairment testing were reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june 30 2020 revealed that if the wacc increased by 1 andor the longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be in excess of its respective net book value and would pass the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test each year at june 30th unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test there were no events through december 31 2020 that would change our impairment assessment the estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be significant a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 2 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services the performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services the transaction price we measure revenue by estimating the transaction price based on the consideration specified in the client arrangement revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied our revenue is primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising communications and marketing services in the following fundamental disciplines advertising which includes creative advertising services and strategic media planning and buying services customer relationship management or crm which includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations and healthcare advertising our client contracts are primarily fees for service on a rate per hour or per project basis revenue is recorded net of sales use and value added taxes 

performance obligations in substantially all our disciplines the performance obligation is to provide advisory and consulting services at an agreedupon level of effort to accomplish the specified engagement our client contracts are comprised of diverse arrangements involving fees based on any one or a combination of the following an agreed fee or rate per hour for the level of effort expended by our employees commissions based on the client’s spending for media purchased from third parties qualitative or quantitative incentive provisions specified in the contract and reimbursement for thirdparty costs that we are required to include in revenue when we control the vendor services related to these costs and we act as principal the transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price and is recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation clients typically receive and consume the benefit of our services as they are performed substantially all our client contracts provide that we are compensated for services performed to date and allow for cancellation by either party on short notice typically 90 days without penalty 

generally our shortterm contracts which normally take 30 to 90 days to complete are performed by a single agency and consist of a single performance obligation as a result we do not consider the underlying services as separate or distinct performance obligations because our services are highly interrelated occur in close proximity and the integration of the various components of a marketing message is essential to overall service in certain of our longterm client contracts which have a term of up to one year the performance obligation is a standready obligation because we provide a constant level of similar services over the term of the contract in other longterm contracts when our services are not a standready obligation we consider our services distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation based on its standalone selling price including contracts for strategic media planning and buying services which are considered to be multiple performance obligations and we allocate the transaction price to each distinct service based on the staffing plan and the standalone selling price in substantially all of our creative services contracts we have distinct performance obligations for our services including certain creative services contracts where we act as an agent and arrange at the client’s direction for third parties to perform studio production efforts 

revenue recognition methods a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed because the client receives and consumes the benefit of our performance throughout the contract period or we create an asset with no alternative use and are contractually entitled to payment for our performance to date in the event the client terminates the contract for convenience for these client contracts other than when we have a standready obligation to perform services revenue is recognized over time using input measures that correspond to the level of staff effort expended to satisfy the performance obligation on a rate per hour or equivalent basis for client contracts when we have a standready obligation to perform services on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract typically for periods up to one year where the scope of these arrangements is broad and there are no significant gaps in performing the services we recognize revenue using a timebased measure resulting in a straightline revenue recognition from time to time there may be changes in the client service requirements during the term of a contract and the changes could be significant these changes are typically negotiated as new contracts covering the additional requirements and the associated costs as well as additional fees for the incremental work to be performed 

to a lesser extent for certain other contracts where our performance obligations are satisfied in phases we recognize revenue over time using certain output measures based on the measurement of the value transferred to the customer including milestones achieved where the transaction price or a portion of the transaction price is derived from commissions based on a percentage of purchased media from third parties the performance obligation is not satisfied until the media is run and we have an enforceable contract providing a right to payment accordingly revenue for commissions is recognized at a point in time typically when the media is run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor 

principal vs agent in substantially all our businesses we incur thirdparty costs on behalf of clients including direct costs and incidental or outofpocket costs thirdparty direct costs incurred in connection with the creation and delivery of advertising or marketing communication services include among others purchased media studio production services specialized talent including artists and other freelance labor event marketing supplies materials and services promotional items market research and thirdparty data and other related expenditures outofpocket costs include among others transportation hotel meals and telecommunication charges incurred by us in the course of providing our services billings related to outofpocket costs are included in revenue since we control the goods or services prior to delivery to the client 

however the inclusion of billings related to thirdparty direct costs in revenue depends on whether we act as a principal or as an agent in the client arrangement in most of our businesses including advertising which also includes studio production efforts and media planning and buying services public relations healthcare advertising and most of our crm consumer experience businesses we act as an agent and arrange at the clients direction for third parties to perform certain services in these cases we do not control the goods or services prior to the transfer to the client as a result revenue is recorded net of these costs equal to the amount retained for our fee or commission 

in certain businesses we may act as principal when contracting for thirdparty services on behalf of our clients in our events business and most of our crm execution  support businesses including field marketing and certain specialty marketing businesses we act as principal because we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the client and we are responsible for providing the specified goods or services or we are responsible for directing and integrating thirdparty vendors to fulfill our performance obligation at the agreed upon contractual price in such arrangements we also take pricing risk under the terms of the client contract in certain specialty media buying businesses we act as principal when we control the buying process for the purchase of the media and contract directly with the media vendor in these arrangements we assume the pricing risk under the terms of the client contract when we act as principal we include billable amounts related to thirdparty costs in the transaction price and record revenue over time at the gross amount billed including outofpocket costs consistent with the manner that we recognize revenue for the underlying services contract however in media buying contracts where we act as principal we recognize revenue at a point in time typically when the media is run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor 

variable consideration some of our client arrangements include variable consideration provisions which include performance incentives tiered commission structures and vendor rebates in certain markets outside of the united states variable consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method or the most likely outcome method these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and other factors known at the time performance incentives are typically recognized in revenue over time variable consideration for our media businesses in certain international markets includes rebate revenue and is recognized when it is probable that the media will be run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client in addition when we receive rebates or credits from vendors for transactions entered into on behalf of clients they are remitted to the clients in accordance with contractual requirements or retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned typically when the media is run

nongaap financial measures 

we use ebita and ebita margin as additional operating performance measures that exclude the noncash amortization expense of intangible assets which primarily consists of amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions we define ebita as earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets and ebita margin as ebita divided by revenue ebita and ebita margin are nongaap financial measures we believe that ebita and ebita margin are useful measures for investors to evaluate the performance of our business nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies

revenue 

revenue for 2020 decreased 17826 million or 119 compared to 2019 changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue 04 acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced revenue 04 and negative organic growth decreased revenue 111 as all our geographic markets were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the change in revenue across our principal regional markets were north america decreased 9017 million europe decreased 4997 million asiapacific decreased 1458 million and latin america decreased 1280 million in north america we experienced a decline in organic revenue attributable to the covid19 pandemic in all our disciplines except healthcare in europe and the middle east and africa almost all businesses and regions experienced a decline in organic revenue resulting from the covid19 pandemic which was marginally offset by an increase primarily from the strengthening of the british pound and euro against the us dollar in latin america the impact of the covid19 pandemic compounded by the continuing unstable economic and political conditions in brazil resulted in negative organic growth in brazil and throughout the region in addition the weakening of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar in all countries further contributed to the reduction in revenue in the region in asiapacific almost all our businesses in the region experienced negative organic growth as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the weakening of most currencies against the us dollar had a marginal negative impact on revenue 

the components of revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

• the foreign exchange impact is calculated by translating the current period’s local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue in this case 132320 million for the total column the foreign exchange impact is the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period constant currency revenue 131711 million less 132320 million for the total column 

• acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date as a result acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition is attributed to organic growth disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of dispositions through the disposition date the acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the table 

• organic growth is calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact and the acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue components from total revenue growth 

• the percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component 149537 million for the total column 

changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized assuming exchange rates at february 12 2021 remain unchanged we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to increase revenue between 25 and 30 in the first half of 2021 and by approximately 25 for the full year 

revenue and organic growth in our principal regional markets were in millions 



revenue in europe which includes our primary markets of the uk and the euro zone decreased 4997 million in 2020 compared to 2019 revenue in the uk representing 97 of revenue decreased 1515 million revenue in continental europe which comprises the euro zone and the other european countries representing 177 of revenue decreased 3482 million the decrease in revenue is due to negative organic growth resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

in the normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors in 2020 the reduction in spending by existing clients resulting from the covid19 pandemic offset the benefit from gains of new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients in 2020 and 2019 our largest client represented 34 and 30 of revenue respectively our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 208 and 540 of revenue for 2020 respectively and 196 and 513 of revenue for 2019 respectively 

in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following categories advertising crm which includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations and healthcare 

all our business experienced the effects from client spending reductions related to the covid19 pandemic the spending reductions impacted all our disciplines and markets the most significantly impacted were our advertising discipline our crm consumer experience discipline especially in our event marketing businesses and our crm execution  support discipline primarily in our field marketing and merchandising businesses our public relations discipline was less significantly impacted and our healthcare discipline performed well revenue and organic growth by discipline were in millions

net interest expense 

in 2020 net interest expense increased 55 million yearoveryear to 1895 million interest expense on debt decreased 276 million to 1996 million primarily reflecting a reduction in interest expense from our refinancing activity at lower interest rates in the second half of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 partially offset by a loss of 77 million on the early redemption of the remaining 600 million principal amount of the 2020 notes in the first quarter of 2020 and the interest expense from the issuance of the 420 notes in april 2020 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements interest income in 2020 decreased 280 million yearoveryear to 323 million primarily due to lower rates 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2020 increased yearoveryear to 271 from 260 the nondeductibility in certain jurisdictions of a portion of the covid19 repositioning costs recorded in the second quarter of 2020 had the effect of increasing our effective tax rate for 2020 this increase was substantially offset by a lower effective tax rate on our foreign earnings resulting from a change in legislation in 2019 income tax expense was reduced by 108 million primarily from the net favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions after considering these items our effective rate for 2020 would have approximated the rate for 2019

• organic growth is calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact and the acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue components from total revenue growth 

• the percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component 152902 million for the total column 

changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized

our effective tax rate for 2019 increased slightly yearoveryear to 260 from 256 in 2018 the effective tax rate for 2019 includes a reduction of 108 million primarily from the net favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in the second quarter of 2019 the effective tax rate for 2018 reflects a net increase of 39 million related to an increase in income tax expense for an adjustment to the provisional amounts related to the tax act substantially offset by the impact of a lower tax rate on the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries 

net income and net income per share  omnicom group inc 

net income  omnicom group inc in 2019 increased due to the factors described above 127 million or 10 to 13391 million from 13264 million in 2018 the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries and repositioning charges after the allocated share of 69 million to noncontrolling interests and the additional income tax expense from the finalization of the provisional

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

nongaap operating profit adjusted ebita nongaap net income – omnicom group inc and nongaap diluted net income per share – omnicom group inc are nongaap financial measures which adjusts the 2018 financial measures for the impact of the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries of 1784 million and repositioning charges of 1494 million a net increase of 39 million in income tax expense and an allocation of 69 million to noncontrolling interests for these items accordingly when comparing operating profit ebita net income  omnicom group inc and diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc for 2019 to 2018 we also present the 2018 reported amounts and ebita on page 14 adjusted for the effects of these transactions we believe these nongaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business for comparability of reporting management considers nongaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance these nongaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

the following table reconciles our financial results presented above to the nongaap financial measures in millions except per share amounts 



liquidity and capital resources 

although we experienced a decrease in our cash flow from operations we took numerous proactive steps to strengthen our liquidity and financial position that are intended to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our liquidity in february 2020 we issued 600 million of the 245 notes in march 2020 the net proceeds from the issuance of the 245 notes were used to redeem the remaining 600 million principal amount of the 2020 notes as a result we have no notes maturing until may 2022 in april 2020 we issued 600 million of the 420 notes and we entered into the 400 million 364 day credit facility maturing on april 2 2021 the 364 day credit facility is in addition to our existing 25 billion credit facility additionally in march 2020 we suspended our share repurchase activity 

cash sources and requirements 

our primary liquidity sources are our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents additional liquidity sources include our 25 billion credit facility maturing on february 14 2025 the 400 million 364 day credit facility maturing on april 2 2021 the uncommitted credit lines aggregating 11 billion the ability to issue up to 2 billion of commercial paper and access the capital markets our liquidity funds our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending 

borrowings under our credit facilities may use libor as the benchmark interest rate the libor benchmark rate is expected to be phased out by the end of june 2023 we do not expect that the discontinuation of the libor rate will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations 

working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related 

to our longterm debt principal and interest payments recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations and 

contingent purchase price obligations earnouts from acquisitions our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend 

payments to common shareholders capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock our typical working capital cycle results in a shortterm borrowing requirement that normally peaks during the second quarter of the year due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations 

cash and cash equivalents increased 12948 million from december 31 2019 the components of the increase including the net increase from our refinancing activities were in millions 



principal cash sources and principal cash uses are nongaap liquidity measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful to understand the primary sources and uses of our cash flow and the effect on our cash and cash equivalents nongaap liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2020 we have the following contractual obligations 

• principal payments on longterm debt of 58 billion of which 125 billion is due in 2022 and 750 million in due in 2024 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements depending on the conditions in the credit markets we may refinance this debt or we may use cash from operations including temporally accessing our credit facility to repay this debt 

• interest payments on longterm debt due within the next five years aggregate 6841 million of which 1764 million is payable in 2021 

• the liability for minimum lease payments for operating leases and finance leases due within the next five years aggregate 12 billion of which 3635 million is due in 2021 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

• at december 31 2020 the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was 3093 million and the liability for our postemployment arrangements was 1646 million in 2020 we contributed 91 million to our defined benefit plans and paid 87 million for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2021 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

• the liability of contingent purchase price payments earnouts at december 31 2020 was 719 million of which 321 million is payable in 2021 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

• the liability for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings due in the next five years is 1056 million of which 116 million is payable in 2021 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our nondiscretionary cash requirements for the next twelve months 

cash management 

our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia manage our cash and liquidity each day operations with excess funds invest those funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center treasury centers with excess cash invest on a shortterm basis with third parties generally with maturities ranging from overnight to less than 90 days certain treasury centers have notional pooling arrangements that are used to manage their cash and setoff foreign exchange imbalances the arrangements require each treasury center to have its own notional pool account and to maintain a notional positive account balance additionally under the terms of the arrangement setoff of foreign exchange positions are limited to the long and short positions within their own account to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to issue up to a total of 2 billion of us dollardenominated commercial paper or borrow under the credit facility 364 day credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines this process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as manage our risk to foreign exchange rate imbalances in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines we have a policy governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each institution in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the credit facility these institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

at december 31 2020 our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 23 billion of our total cash and cash equivalents of 56 billion most of the cash is available to us net of any foreign withholding taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states 

at december 31 2020 our net debt position which we define as total debt including shortterm debt less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased 6244 million as compared to december 31 2019 the decrease in net debt primarily resulted from the excess of principal cash sources over principal cash uses of 6248 million 

the components of net debt were in millions 



net debt is a nongaap liquidity measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap liquidity measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management nongaap liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

debt instruments and related covenants 

on february 19 2020 we issued 600 million of the 245 notes the net proceeds from the issuance after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses were 5926 million and were used to redeem the remaining 600 million principal amount of the 2020 notes on march 23 2020 in connection with the redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of 77 million in interest expense following the redemption there were no 2020 notes outstanding 

on april 1 2020 in response to the potential effects on market liquidity arising from the covid19 pandemic we issued 600 million of the 420 notes the net proceeds from the issuance after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses were 5925 million and were used for general corporate purposes which included working capital expenditures fixed asset expenditures and repayment of commercial paper and shortterm debt 

the 245 notes and the 420 notes are senior unsecured obligations of omnicom that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

omnicom and its wholly owned finance subsidiary omnicom capital inc or oci are coobligors under the senior notes due 2022 2024 and 2026 these notes are a joint and several liability of omnicom and oci and omnicom unconditionally guarantees oci’s obligations with respect to the notes oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci’s assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of oci or omnicom to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances such notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

omnicom and oci have jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed ofhp’s obligations with respect to the euro denominated notes due 2027 and 2031 ofhp’s assets consist of its investments in several wholly owned finance companies that function as treasury centers that provide funding for various operating companies in europe brazil australia and other countries in the asiapacific region the finance companies’ assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans that they make or have made to the operating companies in their respective regions and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of omnicom oci or ofhp to obtain funds from their subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances the euro denominated notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of ofhp and each of omnicom and oci respectively 

the credit facility and the 364 day credit facility each contain a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash charges of no more than 35 times for the most recently ended 12month period on october 26 2020 we amended the credit facility and the 364 day credit facility to provide additional flexibility with respect to the leverage ratio covenant the amendments increase the maximum leverage ratio to 40 times through december 31 2021 for the credit agreement and to 40 times through the maturity for the 364 day credit facility at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with these covenants as our leverage ratio was 30 times the credit facility and the 364 day credit facility do not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 

at december 31 2020 our longterm and shortterm debt was rated bbb and a2 by sp and baa1 and p2 by moodys our access to the commercial paper market and the cost of these borrowings are affected by market conditions and our credit ratings our longterm debt credit facility and the 364 day credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings 

credit markets and availability of credit 

in light of the uncertainty of future economic conditions we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and we will continue to actively manage our discretionary expenditures we have not repurchased any of our common stock since march 13 2020 and we do not plan to resume our repurchases until we believe economic conditions have begun to stabilize we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients we believe that these actions in addition to the availability of our credit facility and 364 day credit facility are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital needs and our discretionary spending for additional information about our credit facilities see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have typically funded our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 we reduced our commercial paper issuances as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of the issuance of the 420 notes in april 2020 in 2019 we issued shortterm debt in a private placement to reduce our commercial paper issuances this shortterm debt was redeemed in the third quarter of 2019 additional liquidity sources include our credit facility 364 day credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines at december 31 2020 there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit facility the 364 day credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines 

commercial paper activity was dollars in millions 



we expect to continue issuing commercial paper to fund our daytoday liquidity however disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads to mitigate any disruption in the credit markets and to fund our liquidity we may borrow under the credit facility 364 day credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines or access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist we will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any disruptions in the credit markets in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we manage our exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk through various strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we may use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes using derivatives exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations we manage that risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivatives we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivatives by performing a valueatrisk or var analysis var is a statistical model that uses historical currency exchange rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 95 confidence a maximum oneday change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2020 was not significant 

foreign currency exchange risk 

in 2020 our international operations represented approximately 45 of our revenue changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized the effects of foreign currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone the uk australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies as an integral part of our global treasury operations we centralize our cash and use notional multicurrency pools to manage the foreign currency exchange risk that arises from imbalances between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers in addition there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts to manage this risk at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 1696 million and 2842 million respectively at december 31 2020 and 2019 the net fair value of the forward foreign contracts was not material see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency derivatives are designated as economic hedges therefore any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposure by using these financial instruments we reduce financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain which might occur if the markets move favorably the terms of our forward foreign exchange contracts are generally less than 90 days 

interest rate risk 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt at december 31 2020 our longterm debt consists entirely of fixedrate debt 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients that operate in nearly every sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client represented 34 of revenue in 2020 however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn

 item 1a risk factors 

adverse economic conditions a reduction in client spending a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

economic conditions have a direct impact on our business results of operations and financial position adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements in addition a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements which may not be available on favorable terms or at all even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital such actions may not be effective 

in an economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 

clients periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive industry key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently particularly large multinational clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in 2019 our 100 largest clients represented approximately 51 of our revenue clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not 

replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business results of operations and financial position 

in 2019 our international operations represented approximately 46 of our revenue we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone the united kingdom or the uk australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly their financial statements are translated into us dollars as a result both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our business results of operations and financial position in addition funds transferred to the united states can be adversely or beneficially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process store and transmit data summarize results manage our business and maintain client advertising and marketing information increased cybersecurity threats and attacks which are becoming more sophisticated pose a risk to our systems and networks security breaches improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public we also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations our systems and processes to protect against detect prevent respond to and mitigate cybersecurity incidents and our organizational training for employees to develop an understanding of cybersecurity risks and threats may be unable to prevent material security breaches theft modification or loss of data employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats such events could adversely affect our business and reputation in addition we use thirdparty service providers including cloud providers to store transmit and process data our insurance may not protect us against damages resulting from cybersecurity incidents which could adversely affect our business and reputation 

government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs such regulation may seek among other things to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and a number of international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in highgrowth markets and developing countries which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions competition for new business and staff currency exchange rate fluctuation political conditions regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations in addition we conduct business in numerous 

highgrowth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped vague inconsistently enforced retroactively applied or frequently changed the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally our operations are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and stringent and any violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation for financial information by geographic region see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

we have substantial operations in the uk and the euro zone on january 31 2020 the uk withdrew from the european union or eu commonly referred to as “brexit” following its withdrawal the uk will enter negotiations with the eu regarding trade and other relationships during a transition period until december 31 2020 the uncertainties related to the effects of brexit have crossborder operational financial and tax implications among others and any economic volatility that may arise in the uk the eu or elsewhere may adversely affect our business 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the process we conduct business legal and financial due diligence to identify and evaluate material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our business results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized knowhow of the acquired workforce as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at june 30 and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

generally our businesses are not directly affected by current laws and other regulations aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise although our businesses could be in the future however we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers further if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements either directly or indirectly their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs therefore at this time we cannot estimate what impact such regulations may have on our business results of operations and financial position

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets and have a large and diverse client base in 2019 our largest client represented 30 of revenue and our 100 largest clients which represent many of the worlds major marketers represented approximately 51 of revenue our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy with no one industry representing more than 14 of our revenue in 2019 although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

as described in more detail below in 2019 revenue decreased 3365 million or 22 compared to 2018 changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue 3159 million or 21 acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced revenue 4451 million or 29 reflecting the disposition of certain nonstrategic businesses and organic growth increased revenue 4245 million or 28 

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services which would reduce the demand for our services revenue is typically lower in the first and third quarters a nd higher i n the second and fourth quarters reflecting client spending patterns during the year and additional project work that usually occurs in the fourth quarter additionally certain global events targeted by major marketers for advertising expenditures such as the fifa world cup and the olympics and certain national events such as the us election process may affect our revenue periodoverperiod in certain businesses typically these events do not have a material impact on our revenue in any period in 2019 improved organic growth in our advertising and media crm consumer experience and healthcare businesses in north america was partially offset by negative performance and divestitures primarily in our crm execution  support disciplines in europe while mixed by market and discipline modest organic growth primarily driven by our advertising and media businesses was offset by the disposition of sellbytel our europeanbased outsourced sales service and support company in the third quarter of 2018 the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and negative performance in our crm consumer experience businesses the economic and political conditions in the eu including the effects of brexit remain uncertain and could negatively impact our businesses in the region in latin america continued unstable economic and political conditions in brazil contributed to our weak performance in the region and the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange rates and disposition activity combined to offset modest organic growth in other countries in the region including chile and mexico in asiapacific organic growth in most countries was offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and negative performance in china which faced a difficult comparison due to strong organic growth in 2018 given the recent events in china and the related precautions being taken to reduce the risk of a contagion we are uncertain of the impact these events may have on our businesses in china as well as the possibility that similar precautions and other actions could extend outside the mainland the political economic and fiscal issues facing the countries we operate in can cause economic uncertainty and volatility however the impact on our business varies by country we monitor economic conditions closely as well as client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage our working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions reductions in client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they continue to consolidate their business within one or a small number of service providers in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points we have structured our business around these trends we believe that our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions provides a competitive advantage to our business in the past and we expect this to continue over the medium and long term

in the near term barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates because of continued improvement in operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our organic revenue to increase modestly for 2020 and over the long term to be in excess of the weighted average nominal gdp growth in our major markets we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities intended to build upon the core capabilities of our strategic disciplines and business platforms expand our operations in highgrowth and emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today 

we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities as well as to identify nonstrategic or underperforming businesses for disposition in the first quarter of 2019 we disposed of certain businesses primarily in our crm execution  support discipline 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we focus on are revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by principal regional market and marketing discipline the impact from foreign currency exchange rate changes growth from acquisitions net of dispositions and growth from our largest clients operating expenses are comprised of cost of services selling general and administrative expenses or sga and depreciation and amortization 

in 2019 our revenue decreased 22 compared to 2018 changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue 21 acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced revenue 29 and organic growth increased revenue 28 across our principal regional markets the changes in revenue were north america increased 04 europe decreased 61 asiapacific decreased 36 and latin america decreased 118 in north america improved organic growth in the united states and canada was substantially offset by a decrease in revenue resulting from disposition activity in the united states and the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar organic revenue growth in the united states was led by our advertising and media crm consumer experience and healthcare businesses and was partially offset by a decrease in organic revenue growth primarily in our crm execution  support businesses in europe modest organic growth in the region especially in the uk and spain was offset by the weakening of substantially all currencies in the region against the us dollar disposition activity and negative performance in france in latin america the weakening of currencies in the region against the us dollar and negative performance and disposition activity in brazil offset modest organic growth in chile and mexico in asiapacific organic growth in most countries in the region especially japan new zealand and india was offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar disposition activity and negative performance in china which faced a difficult comparison due to strong organic growth in 2018 the change in revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 in our fundamental disciplines was advertising increased 21 crm consumer experience decreased 07 crm execution  support decreased 280 public relations decreased 39 and healthcare increased 94 

we measure cost of services in two distinct categories salary and service costs and occupancy and other costs as a service business salary and service costs make up a significant portion of our operating expenses and substantially all these costs comprise the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services salary and service costs include employee compensation and benefits freelance labor and direct service costs which include thirdparty supplier costs and clientrelated travel costs occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the delivery of our services including office rent and other occupancy costs equipment rent technology costs general office expenses and other expenses 

sga expenses comprise thirdparty marketing costs professional fees and compensation and benefits and occupancy and other costs of our corporate and executive offices which includes groupwide finance and accounting treasury legal and governance human resource oversight and similar costs 

operating expenses in 2019 decreased 3253 million or 25 yearoveryear primarily as a result of our disposition activity in 2019 and 2018 and the weakening of substantially all foreign currencies against the us dollar operating expenses in 2018 also included a net reduction of 290 million recorded in the third quarter of 2018 comprised of a 1784 million reduction related to the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 1494 million related to charges incurred for repositioning actions which included 737 million in salary and service costs for incremental severance and 735 million in occupancy and other costs for office lease termination and consolidation 

salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue decreased 3339 million or 30 in 2019 compared to 2018 due to our disposition activity in 2019 and 2018 as well as the incremental severance charge of 737 million recorded in the third quarter of 2018 that did not affect 2019 occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs decreased 878 million or 67 in 2019 compared to 2018 due to our disposition activity in 2019 and 2018 as well as the office lease termination and consolidation charge of 735 million recorded in the third quarter of 2018 that did not affect 2019 operating margin increased 02 periodoverperiod and earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets or ebita margin increased 02 periodoverperiod the net decrease in operating expenses of 290 million in 2018 related to the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries partially offset by the charges for the repositioning actions increased both operating margin and ebita margin for 2018 by 02 the yearoveryear increase in margins primarily reflects a change in the mix of our business during the current period including the positive effects following the disposition of underperforming businesses in the current and prior year and our repositioning activity in the third quarter of 2018 as well as our ongoing efforts to manage our cost structure and increase the efficiency of the operations of our agencies 

in 2019 net interest expense decreased 252 million yearoveryear to 1840 million interest expense on debt decreased 147 million to 2272 million primarily reflecting a reduction in interest expense from refinancing activity in the third quarter of 2019 at lower interest rates including the retirement of our 500 million 625 senior notes due 2019 or 2019 notes at maturity and the settlement of the outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swaps partially offset by a loss on the partial redemption of 400 million of our 1 billion 445 senior notes due 2020 or 2020 notes and the issuance of €500 million 080 senior notes due july 8 2027 and €500 million 140 senior notes due july 8 2031 collectively the euro notes see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements interest income in 2019 increased 31 million yearoveryear to 603 million due to higher cash balances at our treasury centers 

our effective tax rate for 2019 increased slightly yearoveryear to 260 from 256 the effective tax rate for 2018 reflects the impact of a lower tax rate on the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries substantially offset by an increase in income tax expense for an adjustment to the provisional amounts related to the tax act 

net income  omnicom group inc in 2019 increased due to the factors described above 127 million or 10 to 13391 million from 13264 million in 2018 the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries and repositioning charges after the allocated share of 69 million to noncontrolling interests and the additional income tax expense from the finalization of the provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act increased net income  omnicom group inc in 2018 by 182 million diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc increased 39 to 606 in 2019 compared to 583 in 2018 due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock net of shares issued for restricted stock awards stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries and repositioning charges net of the additional income tax expense from the finalization of the provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act increased diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc in 2018 by 008 and nongaap diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc increased 54 in 2019 compared to 2018 adjusted for these items 

critical accounting policies 

the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes including note 2 for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap and are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our equity method investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill 

we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions the evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation geographic coverage competitive position and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach or their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the assets we acquire are intangible assets primarily consisting of the knowhow of the personnel which is treated as part of goodwill and under us gaap is not required to be valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets that are required to be valued separately a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at june 30 and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable under fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to the goodwill impairment test although not required we performed the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units and practice areas of each agency network monitor the performance and are responsible for the agencies in their region the regional reporting units report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and in fasb asc topic 350 consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and occupancy and other costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our virtual client network strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions 

we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” for each reporting unit 

the assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june 30 2019 and 2018 were 



long term growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in for the past ten years the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the average nominal gdp or ngdp growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was approximately 32 and 36  respectively we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2019 we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to ngdp based on our historical performance we also believe that our longterm growth rate will exceed ngdp growth in the markets we operate in which are similar across our reporting units for our annual test as of june 30 2019 we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 35 

when performing the annual impairment test at june 30 2019 and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2019 in the first half of 2019 our revenue increased 27 which excluded our net disposition activity and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates while our businesses in europe had improved performance as of june 30 2019 the continuing uncertain economic and political conditions in the eu were further complicated by the united kingdoms ongoing negotiations with the european council to withdraw from the eu during the first half of 2019 weakness in certain latin american economies had the potential to affect our nearterm performance in that region we considered the effect of these conditions in our annual impairment test 

the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 

our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion 

based on the results of our impairment test we concluded that goodwill at june 30 2019 was not impaired because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective net book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail the goodwill impairment test was approximately 65 notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used for wacc and longterm growth rate in our impairment testing are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june 30 2019 revealed that if the wacc increased by 1 andor the longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of its respective net book value and would pass the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test the estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be significant a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

subsequent to the annual impairment test at june 30 2019 and considering our operating performance in the second half of the year there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim impairment test additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 2 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 under asc 606 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services the performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services the transaction price we recognize revenue from contracts with customers that are based on statements of work that are typically separately negotiated with the clients by our individual agencies including agency networks and our agencies execute tens of thousands of contracts per year we measure revenue by estimating the transaction price based on the consideration specified in the client arrangement revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied our revenue is primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising communications and marketing services in the following fundamental disciplines advertising which includes creative advertising services and strategic media planning and buying services crm which includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations 

and healthcare advertising our client contracts are primarily fees for service on a rate per hour or per project basis revenue is recorded net of sales use and value added taxes 

performance obligations  in substantially all our disciplines the performance obligation is to provide advisory and consulting services at an agreedupon level of effort to accomplish the specified engagement our client contracts are comprised of diverse arrangements involving fees based on any one or a combination of the following an agreed fee or rate per hour for the level of effort expended by our employees commissions based on the client’s spending for media purchased from third parties qualitative or quantitative incentive provisions specified in the contract and reimbursement for thirdparty costs that we are required to include in revenue when we control the vendor services related to these costs and we act as principal the transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price and is recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation clients typically receive and consume the benefit of our services as they are performed substantially all our client contracts provide that we are compensated for services performed to date and allow for cancellation by either party on short notice typically 90 days without penalty 

generally our shortterm contracts which normally take 30 to 90 days to complete are performed by a single agency and consist of a single performance obligation as a result we do not consider the underlying services as separate or distinct performance obligations because our services are highly interrelated occur in close proximity and the integration of the various components of a marketing message is essential to overall service in certain of our longterm client contracts which have a term of up to one year the performance obligation is a standready obligation because we provide a constant level of similar services over the term of the contract in other longterm contracts when our services are not a standready obligation we consider our services distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation based on its standalone selling price including contracts for strategic media planning and buying services which are considered to be multiple performance obligations and we allocate the transaction price to each distinct service based on the staffing plan and the standalone selling price in substantially all of our creative services contracts we have distinct performance obligations for our services including certain creative services contracts where we act as an agent and arrange at the client’s direction for third parties to perform studio production efforts 

revenue recognition methods  a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed because the client receives and consumes the benefit of our performance throughout the contract period or we create an asset with no alternative use and are contractually entitled to payment for our performance to date in the event the client terminates the contract for convenience for these over time client contracts other than when we have a standready obligation to perform services revenue is recognized over time using input measures that correspond to the level of staff effort expended to satisfy the performance obligation on a rate per hour or equivalent basis for client contracts when we have a standready obligation to perform services on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract typically for periods up to one year where the scope of these arrangements is broad and there are no significant gaps in performing the services we recognize revenue using a timebased measure resulting in a straightline revenue recognition from time to time there may be changes in the client service requirements during the term of a contract and the changes could be significant these changes are typically negotiated as new contracts covering the additional requirements and the associated costs as well as additional fees for the incremental work to be performed 

to a lesser extent for certain other contracts where our performance obligations are satisfied in phases we recognize revenue over time using certain output measures based on the measurement of the value transferred to the customer including milestones achieved where the transaction price or a portion of the transaction price is derived from commissions based on a percentage of purchased media from third parties the performance obligation is not satisfied until the media is run and we have an enforceable contract providing a right to payment accordingly revenue for commissions is recognized at a point in time typically when the media is run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor 

principal vs agent  in substantially all our businesses we incur thirdparty costs on behalf of clients including direct costs and incidental or outofpocket costs thirdparty direct costs incurred in connection with the creation and delivery of advertising or marketing communication services include among others purchased media studio production services specialized talent including artists and other freelance labor event marketing supplies materials and services promotional items market research and thirdparty data and other related expenditures outofpocket costs include among others transportation hotel meals and telecommunication charges incurred by us in the course of providing our services billings related to outofpocket costs are included in revenue since we control the goods or services prior to delivery to the client 

however the inclusion of billings related to thirdparty direct costs in revenue depends on whether we act as a principal or as an agent in the client arrangement in most of our businesses including advertising which also includes studio production efforts and media planning and buying services public relations healthcare advertising and most of our crm consumer experience businesses we act as an agent and arrange at the clients direction for third parties to perform certain services in these cases we do not control the goods or services prior to the transfer to the client as a result revenue is recorded net of these costs equal to the amount retained for our fee or commission 

in certain businesses we may act as principal when contracting for thirdparty services on behalf of our clients in our events business and most of our crm execution  support businesses including field marketing and certain specialty marketing businesses we act as principal because we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the client and we are responsible for providing the specified goods or services or we are responsible for directing and integrating thirdparty vendors to fulfill our performance obligation at the agreed upon contractual price in such arrangements we also take pricing risk under the terms of the client contract in certain specialty media buying business we act as principal when we control the buying process for the purchase of the media and contract directly with the media vendor in these arrangements we assume the pricing risk under the terms of the client contract when we act as principal we include billable amounts related to thirdparty costs in the transaction price and record revenue over time at the gross amount billed including outofpocket costs consistent with the manner that we recognize revenue for the underlying services contract however in media buying contracts where we act as principal we recognize revenue at a point in time typically when the media is run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor 

variable consideration  some of our client arrangements include variable consideration provisions which include performance incentives tiered commission structures and vendor rebates in certain markets outside of the united states variable consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method or the most likely outcome method these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and other factors known at the time performance incentives are typically recognized in revenue over time variable consideration for our media businesses in certain international markets includes rebate revenue and is recognized when it is probable that the media will be run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client in addition when we receive rebates or credits from vendors for transactions entered into on behalf of clients they are remitted to the clients in accordance with contractual requirements or retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned which is typically when the media is run

revenue 

in 2019 revenue decreased 3365 million or 22 to 149537 million from 152902 million in 2018 changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue 3159 million acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced revenue 4451 million and organic growth increased revenue 4245 million the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue 21 or 3159 million primarily resulting from the weakening of substantially all foreign currencies especially the euro british pound australian dollar brazilian real and canadian dollar against the us dollar 

the components of revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

• the foreign exchange impact is calculated by translating the current period’s local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue in this case 152696 million for the total column the foreign exchange impact is the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period constant currency revenue 149537 million less 152696 million for the total column 

• acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date as a result acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition is attributed to organic growth disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of dispositions through the disposition date the acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the table 

• organic growth is calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact and the acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue components from total revenue growth 

• the percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component 152902 million for the total column 

changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized assuming exchange rates at february 10 2020 remain unchanged we estimate the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to decrease revenue in the first quarter of 2020 by approximately 05 and will have a marginal negative impact for the remainder of 2020 

revenue and organic growth in our principal regional markets were in millions 



revenue in europe which includes our primary markets of the uk and the euro zone decreased 2680 million in 2019 as compared to the prior year revenue in the uk representing 96 of total revenue decreased 237 million primarily due to the weakening of the british pound against the us dollar revenue in continental europe which comprises the euro zone and the other european countries representing 179 of total revenue decreased 2443 million primarily due to disposition activity and the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates 

in north america improved organic growth in the united states and canada was substantially offset by a decrease in revenue resulting from disposition activity in the united states and the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar organic revenue growth in the united states was led by our advertising and media crm consumer experience and healthcare businesses and was partially offset by a decrease in organic revenue growth primarily in our crm execution  support businesses in europe modest organic growth in the region especially in the uk and spain was offset by the weakening of substantially all currencies in the region against the us dollar disposition activity and negative performance in france in latin america the weakening of currencies in the region against the us dollar and negative performance and disposition activity in brazil offset modest organic growth in chile and mexico in asiapacific organic growth in most countries in the region especially japan new zealand and india was offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar disposition activity and negative performance in china which faced a difficult comparison due to strong organic growth in 2018 

in the normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors the net change in 2019 was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients in 2019 and 2018 our largest client represented 30 of revenue our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 196 and 513 of revenue in 2019 respectively and 191 and 507 of revenue in 2018 respectively 

in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following categories advertising crm which includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations and healthcare

net interest expense 

in 2019 net interest expense decreased 252 million yearoveryear to 1840 million in 2019 interest expense on debt decreased 147 million to 2272 million primarily reflecting a reduction in interest expense from refinancing activity in the third quarter of 2019 at lower interest rates including the maturity and retirement of the 2019 notes and the settlement of the outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swaps partially offset by a loss on the partial redemption of the 2020 notes and the issuance of the euro notes see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements interest income in 2019 increased 31 million yearoveryear to 603 million due to higher cash balances at our treasury centers

our primary liquidity sources are our operating cash flow cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments additional liquidity sources include our 25 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility expiring on july 31 2021 uncommitted credit lines aggregating 13 billion the ability to issue up to 2 billion of commercial paper and access to the capital markets our liquidity funds our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending 

borrowings under our credit facilities may use libor as the benchmark interest rate the libor benchmark rate is expected to be phased out after the end of 2021 we do not expect that the discontinuation of the libor rate will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations 

working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related to our longterm debt principal and interest payments recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations and contingent purchase price obligations earnouts from acquisitions our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend payments to common shareholders capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock we typically have a shortterm borrowing requirement normally peaking during the second quarter of the year due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations on january 1 2019 we adopted asc 842 which had a substantial impact on total assets and liabilities but had no impact on our results of operations cash flows or equity the adoption of asc 842 will not have a significant impact on our nondiscretionary funding requirement based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending for the next twelve months 

cash and cash equivalents increased 6533 million from december 31 2018 the components of the increase including the net increase from our refinancing activities were

cash management 

our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia manage our cash and liquidity each day operations with excess funds invest those funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to issue up to a total of 2 billion of us dollardenominated commercial paper or borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines this process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as manage our risk to foreign exchange rate imbalances in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines 

we have a policy governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each institution in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the credit facility these institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

at december 31 2019 our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 13 billion of our total cash and cash equivalents of 43 billion most of the cash is available to us net of any foreign withholding taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states 

at december 31 2019 our net debt position which we define as total debt including shortterm debt less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased 3988 million as compared to december 31 2018 the decrease in net debt is due primarily to the excess of cash sources over cash uses of 2393 million and an increase in operating capital of 1251 million

credit markets and availability of credit 

we typically fund our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper in the first half of 2019 we issued shortterm debt in a private placement to reduce our commercial paper issuances this shortterm debt was redeemed in the third quarter additional liquidity sources include our credit facility and uncommitted credit lines at december 31 2019 there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines 

commercial paper activity was dollars in millions 



we expect to continue issuing commercial paper to fund our daytoday liquidity however disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads to mitigate any future disruption in the credit markets and to fund our liquidity we may borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines or access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist we will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

in the normal course of business we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements at december 31 2019 our contractual obligations were in millions

certain acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts that are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in results of operations 

the liability for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings is payable through 2026 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

at december 31 2019 our commercial commitments were in millions 



at december 31 2019 there were no significant offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we manage our exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk through various strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we may use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes using derivatives exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations we manage that risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivatives we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivatives by performing a valueatrisk analysis or var var is a statistical model that uses historical currency exchange rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 

95 confidence a maximum oneday change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2019 was not significant 

foreign currency exchange risk 

in 2019 our international operations represented approximately 46 of our revenue changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized the effects of foreign currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone the uk australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies as an integral part of our global treasury operations we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pools to manage the foreign currency exchange risk that arises from imbalances between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds in addition there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts to manage this risk at december 31 2019 and 2018 we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2842 million and 861 million respectively at december 31 2019 and 2018 the net fair value of the forward foreign contracts was not material see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency derivatives are designated as economic hedges therefore any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposure by using these financial instruments we reduce financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain which might occur if the markets move favorably the terms of our forward foreign exchange contracts are generally less than 90 days 

interest rate risk 

we may use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt in august 2019 we settled the outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swaps see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the settlement our longterm debt portfolio consists entirely of fixed rate debt 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients that operate in nearly every sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client represented 30 of revenue in 2019 however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn

 the various components of our business including revenue by discipline and geographic area and material factors that affected us in 2018  are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or mda of this report none of our acquisitions or dispositions individually or in the aggregate in the threeyear period ended december 31 2018  was material to our results of operations or financial position for information about our acquisitions see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

our clients

 item 1a risk factors 

adverse economic conditions a reduction in client spending a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

economic conditions have a direct impact on our business results of operations and financial position adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements in addition a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements which may not be available on favorable terms or at all even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital such actions may not be effective 

 in an economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 

clients periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive industry key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently particularly large multinational clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

our 100 largest clients represent approximately 51  of our revenue clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business results of operations and financial position 

our international operations represent approximately 48  of our 2018  revenue we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone the united kingdom or the uk australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly their financial statements are translated into us dollars as a result both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our business results of operations and financial position in addition funds transferred to the united states can be adversely or beneficially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process store and transmit data summarize results manage our business and maintain client advertising and marketing information increased cybersecurity threats and attacks which are becoming more sophisticated pose a risk to our systems and networks security breaches improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public we also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations our systems and processes to protect against detect prevent respond to and mitigate cybersecurity incidents and our organizational training for employees to develop an understanding of cybersecurity risks and threats may be unable to prevent material security breaches theft modification or loss of data employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats such events could adversely affect our business and reputation in addition we use thirdparty service providers including cloud providers to store transmit and process data our insurance may not protect us against damages resulting from cybersecurity incidents which could adversely affect our business and reputation 

government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs such regulation may seek among other things to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and a number of international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in highgrowth markets and developing countries which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions competition for new business and staff currency exchange rate fluctuation political conditions regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations in addition we conduct business in numerous highgrowth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped vague inconsistently enforced retroactively applied or frequently changed the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally our operations are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and stringent and any violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation for financial information by geographic region see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements 

we have substantial operations in the uk and the euro zone in june 2016 voters in the uk elected to withdraw from the european union or eu commonly referred to as “brexit” unless the eu agrees to an extension the uk is scheduled to exit the eu on march 29 2019 and it is possible that the uk may exit without an agreement in place the uncertainties related to brexit have crossborder operational financial and tax implications among others and any economic volatility that may arise in the uk the eu or elsewhere may adversely affect our business 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the process we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our business results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized knowhow of the acquired workforce as discussed in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

generally our businesses are not directly affected by current laws and other regulations aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise although our businesses could be in the future however we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers further if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements either directly or indirectly their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs therefore at this time we cannot estimate what impact such regulations may have on our business results of operations and financial position

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in various legal proceedings we do not presently expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets and have a large and diverse client base in 2018  our largest client represented 30  of revenue and our 100 largest clients which represent many of the worlds major marketers comprised approximately 51  of revenue our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy with no one industry comprising more than 14  of our revenue in 2018  although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

as described in more detail below in 2018  revenue increased   166 million  or 01  compared to 2017  changes in foreign exchange rates increased  revenue 851 million  or 06  acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced  revenue 3266 million  or 21  reflecting the disposition of certain nonstrategic businesses and organic growth increased  revenue 4042 million  or 26  in addition the impact of the adoption of asc 606 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements reduced revenue by 1461 million  or 10  

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services which would reduce the demand for our services revenue is typically lower in the first and third quarters a nd higher i n the second and fourth quarters reflecting client spending patterns during the year and additional project work that usually occurs in the fourth quarter additionally certain global events targeted by major marketers for advertising expenditures such as the fifa world cup and the olympics and certain national events such as the us election process may affect our revenue periodoverperiod in certain businesses typically these events do not have a significant impact on our revenue in any period in 2018  our agencies in north america continued their modest growth with uneven performance across our service disciplines in europe while mixed by country most of our businesses had strong growth however the continuing uncertain economic and political conditions in the eu have been complicated by the status of brexit in brazil unstable economic and political conditions contributed to the continuing volatility in the market most of our businesses in asiapacific had positive growth consistent with recent periods the economic and fiscal issues facing the countries we operate in can cause economic uncertainty and volatility however the impact on our business varies by country we monitor economic conditions closely as well as client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage our working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions reductions in client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have made it a practice to consolidate their business within one service provider in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points we have structured our business around these trends we believe that our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions have provided a competitive advantage to our business in the past and we expect this to continue over the medium and long term in addition in 2018 we completed the process of forming practice areas within our global network structure to bring together agencies operating in common disciplines this action leverages existing resources and in close coordination with our key client matrix organization enhances the development of custom client solutions 

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives these services include among others advertising branding content marketing corporate social responsibility consulting crisis communications custom publishing data analytics database management digitaldirect marketing digital transformation entertainment marketing experiential marketing field marketing financialcorporate businesstobusiness advertising graphic artsdigital imaging healthcare marketing and communications instore design interactive marketing investor relations marketing research media planning and buying merchandising and point of sale mobile marketing multicultural marketing nonprofit marketing organizational communications package design product placement promotional marketing public affairs public relations retail marketing sales support search engine marketing shopper marketing social media marketing and sports and event marketing 

in the near term barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates because of continued improvement in operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our organic revenue to increase modestly for 2019  and over the long term to be in excess of the weighted average nominal gdp growth in our major markets we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities intended to build upon the core capabilities of our strategic disciplines and business platforms expand our operations in highgrowth and emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today 

we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities as well as to identify nonstrategic or underperforming businesses for disposition during the third quarter of 2018  we disposed of certain businesses primarily in our crm execution  support discipline and recorded a net gain of 1784 million  primarily related to the sale of sellbytel our europeanbased outsourced sales service and support company also during the third quarter we took certain repositioning actions in an effort to continue to improve our strategic position and achieve operating efficiencies and we recorded charges of 1494 million  for incremental severance office lease consolidation and termination asset writeoffs and other charges we expect the reduction to our earnings for the disposition activity to be substantially offset by savings achieved from the operating efficiencies and cost reductions as well as any incremental earnings from new acquisition activity and we expect a net reduction to revenue of approximately 3 to 35 in the first half of 2019 and 25 for the full year 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we focus on are revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by principal regional market and marketing discipline the impact from foreign currency exchange rate changes growth from acquisitions net of dispositions and growth from our largest clients operating expenses are comprised of cost of services selling general and administrative expenses or sga and depreciation and amortization 

in 2018  our revenue increased   01  compared to 2017  changes in foreign exchange rates increased  revenue 06  acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced  revenue 21  and organic growth increased  revenue 26  across our principal regional markets the changes in revenue were north america decreased   28  europe increased   60  asiapacific increased   36  and latin america decreased   75  in north america modest growth in the united states was offset by a decrease in revenue primarily resulting from the impact of the adoption of asc 606 the disposition of our specialty print media business in the second quarter of 2017 and negative performance in canada organic revenue growth in the united states was led by our crm consumer experience healthcare advertising and media and public relations businesses and was partially offset by a decrease in our crm execution  support discipline the revenue increase in europe resulted from strong organic revenue in the region particularly in france spain and the czech republic modest organic revenue growth in the uk and the strengthening of the euro and the british pound against the us dollar in the first half of the year which was partially offset by disposition activity and negative performance in germany the decrease in revenue in latin america was primarily a result of the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar in asiapacific organic growth in most countries in the region especially australia china new zealand and india was partially offset by disposition activity the change in revenue in 2018  compared to 2017  in our four fundamental disciplines was advertising increased   13  crm consumer experience increased   02  crm execution  support decreased   110  public relations increased   17  and healthcare increased   127  

we measure cost of services in two distinct categories salary and service costs and occupancy and other costs as a service business salary and service costs make up a significant portion of our operating expenses and substantially all these costs comprise the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services salary and service costs include employee compensation and benefits freelance labor and direct service costs which include thirdparty supplier costs and clientrelated travel costs occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the delivery of our services including office rent and other occupancy costs equipment rent technology costs general office expenses and other expenses 

sga expenses which increased slightly yearoveryear primarily consist of thirdparty marketing costs professional fees and compensation and benefits and occupancy and other costs of our corporate and executive offices which includes groupwide finance and accounting treasury legal and governance human resource oversight and similar costs 

operating expenses which include the net gain from the disposition of subsidiaries and the repositioning charges as described above see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements decreased   331 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue increased   789 million  or 07  in 2018  compared to 2017  the yearoveryear increase  primarily reflects the incremental severance and other charges of 737 million  incurred in connection with the repositioning actions taken in the third quarter of 2018 occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs increased   688 million  or 55  in 2018  compared to 2017  the yearoveryear change reflects a decrease of 47 million  which was offset by 735 million  of repositioning charges primarily related to office lease consolidation and termination actions taken in the third quarter of 2018 operating margin increased  yearoveryear to 140  from 136  and ebita margin increased  yearoveryear to 146  from 144  the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries and repositioning expenses increased operating profit and operating margin yearover year by 290 million  and 02  respectively 

net interest expense increased   103 million  to 2092 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  interest expense on debt increased   174 million  to 2419 million  in 2018  interest income in 2018   increased   75 million  compared to the prior year 

our effective tax rate for 2018  decreased  periodoverperiod to 256  from 369  in 2017  the decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction of the us federal statutory income tax rate to 21 from 35 resulting from the tax act which was enacted in december 2017 additionally income tax expense for 2018  reflects the following a reduction of approximately 19 million  primarily as a result of the successful resolution of foreign tax claims a reduction of 250 million  related to the net income tax effect of the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries and repositioning actions see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements and additional income tax expense of 289 million  reflecting the finalization of the provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements 

 net income  omnicom group inc in 2018   increased  due to the factors described above 2380 million  or 219  to 13264 million  from 10884 million  in 2017  the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries and repositioning actions after the allocable share of 69 million  to noncontrolling interests and the additional income tax expense from the finalization of the provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act increased net income  omnicom group inc 182 million  diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc increased   254  to 583  in 2018  compared to 465  in 2017  due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock net of shares issued for restricted stock awards stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries and repositioning actions net of the additional income tax expense from the finalization of the provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act increased diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc 008  

critical accounting policies 

the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes including note 2  for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap and are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our equity method and cost method investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill 

we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions the evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation geographic coverage competitive position and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method the assets acquired including identified intangible assets liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values in circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100 of a business is acquired goodwill is recorded as if 100 

were acquired acquisitionrelated costs including advisory legal accounting valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred certain acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts which are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in results of operations the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in results of operations from the acquisition date in 2018  we completed six  acquisitions of new subsidiaries 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach or their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the assets we acquire are intangible assets primarily consisting of the knowhow of the personnel which is treated as part of goodwill and under us gaap is not required to be valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets that are required to be valued separately a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable under fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to the goodwill impairment test although not required we performed the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five global agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our key client matrix organization structure for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and in fasb asc topic 350 consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and occupancy and other costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our virtual client network strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions 

we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” for each reporting unit 

the assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june 30 2018  and 2017  were 



long term growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in for the past ten years the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was approximately   32   and   34  respectively we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2018  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp based on our historical performance we also believe that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth in the markets we operate in which are similar across our reporting units for our annual test as of june 30 2018  we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 4  

when performing the annual impairment test as of june 30 2018  and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2018  in the first half of 2018  our revenue increased 22  which excluded our net disposition activity and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates while our businesses in europe had improved performance the continuing uncertain economic and political conditions in the eu have been further complicated by the united kingdoms ongoing negotiations with the european council to withdraw from the eu during the first half of 2018  weakness in certain latin american economies we operate in has the potential to affect our nearterm performance in that region we considered the effect of these conditions in our annual impairment test 

the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 

our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion 

based on the results of our impairment test we concluded that our goodwill at june 30 2018  was not impaired because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective net book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail the goodwill impairment test was approximately 60  notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used for wacc and longterm growth rate in our impairment testing are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june 30 2018  revealed that if the wacc increased by 1 andor the longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of its respective net book value and would pass the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test the estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be significant a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

subsequent to the annual impairment test at june 30 2018  and considering our operating performance in the second half of the year there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim impairment test additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 2  5  and 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as described below in accordance with asc 606 we changed certain aspects of our revenue recognition accounting policy asc 606 was applied using the modified retrospective method where the cumulative effect of the initial application was recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at january 1 2018 therefore comparative prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition  

under asc 606 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services the performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services the transaction price we measure revenue by estimating the transaction price based on the consideration specified in the client arrangement revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied our revenue is primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising communications and marketing services in the following fundamental disciplines advertising which includes creative advertising services and strategic media planning and buying services customer relationship management or crm which includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations and healthcare advertising our client contracts are primarily fees for service on a rate per hour or per project basis revenue is recorded net of sales use and value added taxes 

performance obligations 

in substantially all our disciplines the performance obligation is to provide advisory and consulting services at an agreedupon level of effort to accomplish the specified engagement our client contracts are comprised of diverse arrangements involving fees based on any one or a combination of the following an agreed fee or rate per hour for the level of effort expended by our employees commissions based on the client’s spending for media purchased from third parties qualitative or quantitative incentive provisions specified in the contract and reimbursement for thirdparty costs that we are required to include in revenue when we control the vendor services related to these costs and we act as principal the transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price and is recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation clients typically receive and consume the benefit of our services as they are performed substantially all our client contracts provide that we are compensated for services performed to date and allow for cancellation by either party on short notice typically 90 days without penalty 

generally our shortterm contracts which normally take 30 to 90 days to complete are performed by a single agency and consist of a single performance obligation as a result we do not consider the underlying services as separate or distinct performance obligations because our services are highly interrelated occur in close proximity and the integration of the various components of a marketing message is essential to overall service in certain of our longterm client contracts which have a term of up to one year the performance obligation is a standready obligation because we provide a constant level of similar services over the term of the contract in other longterm contracts when our services are not a standready obligation we consider our services distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation based on its standalone selling price including contracts for strategic media planning and buying services which are considered to be multiple performance obligations and we allocate the transaction price to each distinct service based on the staffing plan and the standalone selling price in substantially all of our creative services contracts we have distinct performance obligations for our services including certain creative services contracts where we act as an agent and arrange at the client’s direction for thirdparties to perform studio production efforts 

revenue recognition methods 

a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed because the client receives and consumes the benefit of our performance throughout the contract period or we create an asset with no alternative use and are contractually entitled to payment for our performance to date in the event the client terminates the contract for convenience for these over time client contracts other than when we have a standready obligation to perform services revenue is recognized over time using input measures that correspond to the level of staff effort expended to satisfy the performance obligation on a rate per hour or equivalent basis for client contracts when we have a standready obligation to perform services on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract typically for periods up to one year where the scope of these arrangements is broad and there are no significant gaps in performing the services we recognize revenue using a timebased measure resulting in a straightline revenue recognition from time to time there may be changes in the client service requirements during the term of a contract and the changes could be significant these changes are typically negotiated as new contracts covering the additional requirements and the associated costs as well as additional fees for the incremental work to be performed 

to a lesser extent for certain other contracts where our performance obligations are satisfied in phases we recognize revenue over time using certain output measures based on the measurement of the value transferred to the customer including milestones achieved where the transaction price or a portion of the transaction price is derived from commissions based on a percentage of purchased media from third parties the performance obligation is not satisfied until the media is run and we have an enforceable contract providing a right to payment accordingly revenue for commissions is recognized at a point in time typically when the media is run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor 

principal vs agent 

in substantially all our businesses we incur thirdparty costs on behalf of clients including direct costs and incidental or out ofpocket costs thirdparty direct costs incurred in connection with the creation and delivery of advertising or marketing communication services include among others purchased media studio production services specialized talent including artists and other freelance labor event marketing supplies materials and services promotional items market research and thirdparty data and other related expenditures outofpocket costs include among others transportation hotel meals and telecommunication charges incurred by us in the course of providing our services billings related to outofpocket costs are included in revenue since we control the goods or services prior to delivery to the client 

however the inclusion of billings related to thirdparty direct costs in revenue depends on whether we act as a principal or as an agent in the client arrangement in most of our businesses including advertising which also includes studio production efforts and media planning and buying services public relations healthcare advertising and most of our crm consumer experience businesses we act as an agent and arrange at the clients direction for third parties to perform certain services in these cases we do not control the goods or services prior to the transfer to the client as a result revenue is recorded net of these costs equal to the amount retained for our fee or commission 

in certain businesses we may act as principal when contracting for thirdparty services on behalf of our clients in our events business and most of our crm execution  support businesses including field marketing and certain specialty marketing businesses we act as principal because we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the client and we are responsible for providing the specified goods or services or we are responsible for directing and integrating thirdparty vendors to fulfill our performance obligation at the agreed upon contractual price in such arrangements we also take pricing risk under the terms of the client contract in certain specialty media buying business we act as principal when we control the buying process for the purchase of the media and contract directly with the media vendor in these arrangements we assume the pricing risk under the terms of the client contract when we act as principal we include billable amounts related to thirdparty costs in the transaction price and record revenue over time at the gross amount billed including outofpocket costs consistent with the manner that we recognize revenue for the underlying services contract however in media buying contracts where we act as principal we recognize revenue at a point in time typically when the media is run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor 

variable consideration 

some of our client arrangements include variable consideration provisions which include performance incentives tiered commission structures and vendor rebates in certain markets outside of the united states variable consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method or the most likely outcome method these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and other factors known at the time performance incentives are typically recognized in revenue over time variable consideration for our media businesses in certain international markets includes rebate revenue and is recognized when it is probable that the media will be run including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client in addition when we receive rebates or credits from vendors for transactions entered into on behalf of clients they are remitted to the clients in accordance with contractual requirements or retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned which is typically when the media is run

results of operations 

accounting changes 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as described below in accordance with asc 606 we changed certain aspects of our revenue recognition accounting policy asc 606 was applied using the modified retrospective method where the cumulative effect of the initial application was recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at january 1 2018 therefore comparative prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition  or asc 605 

upon adoption of asc 606 our accounting policy for certain thirdparty outofpocket costs which are incurred in connection with our services and are billed to clients was required to be changed in addition our policy for performance incentives variable consideration included in certain client contracts was required to be changed the inclusion of thirdparty outofpocket costs in revenue depends on whether we act as a principal or agent in the client arrangement under asc 606 the principal versus agent assessment is based on whether we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer as a result of the adoption of asc 606 certain thirdparty costs are no longer included in revenue and cost of services this change was the principal adjustment to our reported revenue and operating expenses included in the table below however the change had no impact on operating profit 

in addition performance incentives included in certain client contracts can increase revenue if we meet certain quantitative or qualitative objectives in delivering our services under asc 606 performance incentives are now treated as variable consideration prior to the adoption of asc 606 performance incentives were recognized in revenue under asc 605 when specific quantitative goals were achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals was acknowledged by the client under asc 606 variable consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method or the most likely outcome method these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time as a result of this change we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to increase opening retained earnings at january 1 2018 by 195 million  to reflect the transition requirements of asc 606 the effect of this change on our financial position and cash flows was not material 

the impact of the adoption of asc 606 on revenue operating expenses and operating profit for the year ended december 31 2018  was in millions 



the impact of the adoption of asc 606 on net income  omnicom group inc diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc and the consolidated financial statements was not material 

results of operations  2018  compared to 2017  in millions 



nongaap financial measures 

we use ebita and ebita margin as additional operating performance measures that exclude the noncash amortization expense of intangible assets which primarily consists of amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions we define ebita as earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets and ebita margin as ebita divided by revenue ebita and ebita margin are nongaap financial measures we believe that ebita and ebita margin are useful measures for investors to evaluate the performance of our business nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies

in 2018  revenue increased   166 million  or 01  to 152902 million  from 152736 million  in 2017  changes in foreign exchange rates increased  revenue 851 million  acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced  revenue 3266 million  and organic growth increased  revenue 4042 million  

the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates increased  revenue 06  or 851 million  primarily resulting from the strengthening of the euro and british pound against the us dollar partially offset by the weakening of the brazilian real russian ruble and australian dollar against the us dollar 

the components of revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

 changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized assuming exchange rates at february 11 2019  remain unchanged we estimate the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce  revenue in the first half of 2019  by approximately 25  to 3  and 15  for the full year 

revenue and organic growth expressed as a percentage and excluding the impact of asc 606 in our principal regional markets were in millions 



in europe our primary markets are the uk and the euro zone revenue for 2018  in the uk which represents 95  of total revenue increased   43  and revenue in the euro zone and the other european countries which together comprised 191  of total revenue increased   69  

in north america modest growth in the united states was offset by a decrease in revenue primarily resulting from the impact of the adoption of asc 606 the disposition of our specialty print media business in the second quarter of 2017 and negative performance in canada organic revenue growth in the united states was led by our crm consumer experience healthcare advertising and media and public relations businesses and was partially offset by a decrease in our crm execution  support discipline the revenue increase in europe resulted from strong organic revenue in the region particularly in france spain and the czech republic modest organic revenue growth in the uk and the strengthening of the euro and the british pound against the us dollar in the first half of the year which was partially offset by disposition activity and negative performance in germany the decrease in revenue in latin america was primarily a result of the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar in asiapacific organic growth in most countries in the region especially australia china new zealand and india was partially offset by disposition activity 

in the normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors the net change in 2018  was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients our largest client represented 30  of revenue in 2018  and 2017  our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 191  and 507  of revenue in 2018  respectively and 196  and 505  of revenue in 2017  respectively 

in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following categories advertising crm which includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations and healthcare

in the third quarter of 2018  we disposed of certain businesses primarily in our crm execution  support discipline and recorded a net gain of 1784 million  also during the third quarter we took certain repositioning actions in an effort to continue to improve our strategic position and achieve operating efficiencies and we recorded charges of 1494 million  for incremental severance office lease consolidation and termination asset writeoffs and other charges the impact of the repositioning actions and net gain on sale of subsidiaries on operating expenses for 2018  was dollars in millions 



operating expenses which include the net gain from the disposition of subsidiaries and the repositioning charges as described above see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements decreased   331 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue increased   789 million  or 07  in 2018  compared to 2017  the yearoveryear increase  primarily reflects the incremental severance and other charges of 737 million  incurred in connection with the repositioning actions taken in the third quarter of 2018 occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs increased   688 million  or 55  in 2018  compared to 2017  the yearoveryear change reflects a decrease of 47 million  which was offset by 735 million  of repositioning charges primarily related to office lease consolidation and termination actions taken in the third quarter of 2018 operating margin increased  yearoveryear to 140  from 136  and ebita margin increased  yearoveryear to 146  from 144  the net gain on disposition of subsidiaries and repositioning expenses increased operating profit and operating margin yearover year by 290 million  and 02  respectively

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2018   decreased  yearoveryear to 256  from 369  in 2017  the decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction of the us federal statutory income tax rate to 21 from 35 resulting from the tax act income tax expense in 2018  was reduced by approximately 19 million  primarily as a result of the successful resolution of foreign tax claims and 74 million  related to the excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation 

additionally income tax expense for 2018  reflects the following items recorded in the third quarter of 2018  in millions 



the net gain resulting from the net disposition of subsidiaries reflects favorable local tax rates applied to certain nonus gains the tax benefit on the repositioning actions was calculated based on the jurisdictions where the charges were incurred and reflects the likelihood that we will be unable to obtain a tax benefit for all charges incurred further in 2018  we recorded additional income tax expense of 289 million  reflecting the finalization of the provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements

as discussed below in 2017 the tax act reduced net income  omnicom group inc by 1063 million  and diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc by 045  

nongaap financial measures 

we use ebita and ebita margin as additional operating performance measures that exclude the noncash amortization expense of intangible assets which primarily consists of amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions we define ebita as earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets and ebita margin as ebita divided by revenue ebita and ebita margin are nongaap financial measures we believe that ebita and ebita margin are useful measures for investors to evaluate the performance of our business nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

the following table reconciles the us gaap financial measure of net income  omnicom group inc to ebita and ebita margin for the for the periods presented in millions 



revenue 

in 2017  revenue decreased   1433 million  to 152736 million  from 154169 million  in 2016  changes in foreign exchange rates increased  revenue 429 million  acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue decreased  revenue 6473 million  and organic growth increased  revenue 4611 million  

the components of revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

 in 2017  changes in foreign exchange rates continued to negatively impact revenue but at a more moderate rate as compared to 2016  the impact of foreign exchange rates in 2017   increased  revenue by 03  or 429 million  while a number of currencies weakened against the us dollar including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar and russian ruble the most significant impact resulted from the weakening of the british pound 

revenue and organic growth for 2017  and the change in revenue from 2016  in our principal regional markets were in millions 



in europe our primary markets are the uk and the euro zone revenue for 2017  in the uk which represents 91  of total revenue decreased   09  and revenue in the euro zone and the other european countries which together represent 179  of total revenue increased   94  

in north america moderate growth in the united states and strong growth in canada was partially offset by the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar in europe growth in the uk spain russia and italy was offset by the weakening of the british pound and russian ruble against the us dollar and negative performance in the netherlands the increase in revenue in latin america was a result of our acquisition activity in brazil which was partially offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar especially the brazilian real the continuing uncertainty in the economic and political climate in brazil resulted in organic revenue declines that partially offset the growth from our acquisition and also overshadowed strong growth in mexico in asiapacific growth in the major economies in the region was also partially offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar 

in the normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors the net change in 2017  was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients our largest client represented 30  and 30  of revenue in 2017  and 2016  respectively our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 196  and 505  of revenue in 2017  respectively and 183  and 524  of revenue in 2016  respectively

net interest expense 

net interest expense increased   102 million   yearoveryear to   1989 million   in   2017    interest expense on debt increased   148 million  to 2245 million  in 2017  primarily due to a reduced benefit from the fixedtofloating interest rate swaps resulting from higher rates on the floating rate leg and higher interest expense on commercial paper our longterm debt portfolio at december 31 2017  after taking into consideration our outstanding interest rate swaps was approximately 75  fixed rate obligations and 25   and was unchanged from december 31 2016  a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements interest income in 2017   increased   71 million  yearoveryear to 497 million  due to higher interest earned on cash held by our international treasury centers 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2017  was 369  compared to 326  for 2016  the increase  is attributable to the estimated impact of the tax act of 1063 million  partially offset by the recognition of an excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation of 208 million  resulting from the adoption of fasb asu 201609 which requires that beginning in 2017  excess tax benefits and deficiencies arising from sharebased compensation be recognized in results of operations in the period when the restricted stock awards vest or stock options are exercised in prior years excess tax benefits and deficiencies from sharebased compensation were recorded in additional paidin capital

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements 

our primary liquidity sources are our operating cash flow cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments additional liquidity sources include our credit facilities and commercial paper program and access to the capital markets at december 31 2018  we have a 25 billion  revolving credit facility or credit facility expiring on july 31 2021  uncommitted credit lines aggregating 12 billion  and the ability to issue up to 2 billion  of commercial paper borrowings under the credit facility may be in us dollars british pounds or euro our liquidity funds our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending 

working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations and contingent purchase price obligations earnouts from prior acquisitions our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend payments to common shareholders capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock our shortterm borrowing requirements normally peak in the second quarter of the year due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations in addition our 500 million   625 senior notes due 2019  mature on july 15 2019 and are classified as current based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending for the next twelve months 

cash and cash equivalents decreased   1436 million  from december 31 2017  the components of the decrease  were 



principal cash sources and uses amounts are nongaap liquidity measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful to understand the primary sources and uses of our cash flow and the effect on our cash and cash equivalents nongaap liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

cash management 

our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia manage our cash and liquidity each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to issue up to a total of 2 billion  of us dollardenominated commercial paper or borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines this process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as manage our risk to foreign exchange rate imbalances in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines 

we have a policy governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each institution in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the credit facility these institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

at december 31 2018  our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 962 million  of our total cash and cash equivalents of 37 billion  most of the cash is available to us net of any foreign withholding taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states 

our net debt position which we define as total debt including shortterm debt less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at december 31 2018   increased   1056 million  as compared to december 31 2017  the increase  in net debt is due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1385 million  primarily arising from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of 2030 million  partially offset by an increase  in operating capital of 805 million  

the components of net debt at december 31 2018  and 2017  were in millions 



net debt is a nongaap liquidity measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap liquidity measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management nongaap liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

debt instruments and related covenants 

at december 31 2018  the total principal amount of our fixed rate senior notes was 49 billion  and the total notional amount of the outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swaps was 125 billion  the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our longterm debt portfolio to approximately 75  fixed rate obligations and 25  floating rate obligations a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

omnicom group inc or ogi and its wholly owned finance subsidiary omnicom capital inc or oci are coobligors under all the senior notes the senior notes are a joint and several liability of ogi and oci and ogi unconditionally guarantees oci’s obligations with respect to the senior notes oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci’s assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of ogi or oci to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

  the credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12month period ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12month period  at december 31 2018  we were in compliance with these covenants as our leverage ratio was 21  times and our interest coverage ratio was 99  times the credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 

at december 31 2018  our longterm and shortterm debt was rated bbb  and a2  by sp and baa1  and p2  by moodys our access to the commercial paper market and the cost of these borrowings are affected by our credit ratings and market conditions our senior notes and credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event our credit ratings are downgraded 

credit markets and availability of credit 

we typically fund our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper additional liquidity sources include our credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines at december 31 2018  there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit facility or material borrowings under the uncommitted credit lines 

commercial paper activity for the three years ended december 31 2018  was dollars in millions 



while we expect to continue funding our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper we may draw on our credit facility however disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads to mitigate any future disruption in the credit markets and to fund our liquidity we may borrow under the credit facility or access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist we will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

in the normal course of business we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations at december 31 2018  were in millions 



certain acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts that are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in results of operations 

the tax act included a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings which is payable through 2025 see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and liability for our postemployment arrangements was  3275 million  at december 31 2018  in 2018  we contributed 80 million  to our defined benefit pension plans and paid  81 million  in benefits for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2019  

the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 

see note 16  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our lease commitments which comprise a significant component of our occupancy and other costs see note 22  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of the adoption of fasb accounting standards codification topic 842 leases 

commercial commitments at december 31 2018  were in millions 



at december 31 2018  there were no significant offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk through various strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes using derivatives exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations we manage that risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivatives we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivatives by performing a valueatrisk or var analysis var is a statistical model that uses historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 95 confidence a maximum oneday change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2018  was not significant 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our international operations represent approximately 48  of our revenue changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized the effects of foreign currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements 

while our major international markets include the euro zone the uk australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies as an integral part of our global treasury operations we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pools and to a lesser extent forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exchange risk that arises from imbalances between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds at december 31 2018  there were no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts and at december 31 2017  we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 928 million  in addition there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts to manage that risk we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 861 million  and 1363 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the net fair value of the forward foreign contracts at december 31 2018  and 2017  was a current liability of 01 million  and a current asset of 09 million  respectively 

foreign currency derivatives are designated as economic hedges therefore any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures by using these financial instruments we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably the terms of our forward foreign exchange contracts are generally less than 90 days 

interest rate risk 

we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt based on market conditions we may terminate the swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates or to monetize any gain and lock in a reduction in interest expense gains or losses on termination will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt at december 31 2018  the total notional amount of the outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swaps was 125 billion  the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our longterm debt portfolio to approximately 75  fixed rate obligations and 25  floating rate obligations a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients that operate in nearly every sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client represented 30  of revenue in 2018  however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn

 item 1 business 

our business 

omnicom is a strategic holding company and a leading global provider of advertising marketing and corporate communications services we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against other global national and regional advertising and marketing services companies the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and mediums has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to global service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditure 

our branded networks and agencies operate in all major global markets and provide a comprehensive range of services in the following fundamental disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and healthcare in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to better capture the expanded scope of our services in the fourth quarter of 2017 we realigned our service disciplines as a result our crm discipline was grouped into two separate categories crm consumer experience which includes omnicom precision marketing group’s digital  direct marketing agencies as well as our branding agencies shopper marketing agencies and our experiential marketing agencies and crm execution  support which includes field marketing sales support merchandising and point of sale as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services also we realigned and renamed our former specialty communications discipline so that it now exclusively includes agencies offering healthcare marketing and communications services 

although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific advertising marketing and corporate communications services services across our disciplines include 



 1 

our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our networks and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients our fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model requires that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure this collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and comprehensive manner we believe that this organizational philosophy our ability to execute on it and our key client matrix organization structure differentiates us from our competition in addition during 2017 we continued the process of forming practice areas within our global network structure to bring together agencies operating in common disciplines to leverage existing resources and to create in close coordination with our key client matrix organization additional custom client solutions 

as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have made it a practice to consolidate their business within one service provider in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points we have structured our business around this trend we believe that our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions has provided a competitive advantage to our business in the past and we expect this to continue over the medium and long term our key client matrix organization structure facilitates superior client management and allows for greater integration of the services required by the world’s largest brands our overarching strategy is to continue to use our virtual client networks to grow our business relationships with our largest clients by serving them across our networks disciplines and geographies

our clients 

our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy in many cases multiple agencies or networks serve different brand product groups or both within the same client for example in 2017  our largest client represented 30  of revenue and was served by more than 250  of our agencies our 100 largest clients which represent many of the worlds major marketers comprised approximately 51  of revenue and were each served on average by more than 50  of our agencies 

our employees 

at december 31 2017  we employed approximately 77300  people worldwide the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience whether through traditional channels or emerging digital platforms recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our client service professionals around this competency see the mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

adverse economic conditions a reduction in client spending a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

economic conditions have a direct impact on our business results of operations and financial position adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements in addition a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements which may not be available on favorable terms or at all even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital such actions may not be effective 

 in an economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 

clients periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive industry key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently particularly large multinational clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

our 100 largest clients represent approximately 51  of our revenue clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to acquire new clients and to retain existing clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business results of operations and financial position 

our international operations represent approximately 46  of our revenue we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly their financial statements are translated into us dollars as a result both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates would impact our business results of operations and financial position in addition funds transferred to the united states can be adversely or beneficially impacted by foreign currency exchange changes 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process store and transmit data summarize results manage our business and maintain client advertising and marketing information increased cybersecurity threats and attacks which are becoming more sophisticated pose a risk to our systems and networks security breaches improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public we also may have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations we install new systems or upgrade our existing systems to prevent detect address and mitigate cybersecurity incidents and we provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity risks   despite our efforts to protect our systems and networks and sensitive and personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft modification or loss of data employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats such events could adversely affect our business and reputation in addition we use thirdparty service providers including cloud providers to store transmit and process data cybersecurity incidents at these providers could adversely affect our business and reputation 

government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs such regulation may seek among other things to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and a number of international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in highgrowth markets and developing countries which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions competition for new business and talented staff currency fluctuation political conditions regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations in addition we conduct business in numerous highgrowth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped vague inconsistently enforced retroactively applied or frequently changed the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally our operations are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and stringent and any violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation for financial information by geographic region see note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the process we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our business results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized knowhow of the acquired workforce as discussed in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

generally our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise although our businesses could be in the future however we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers further if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements either directly or indirectly their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs therefore at this time we cannot estimate what impact such regulations may have on our business results of operations and financial position

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in various legal proceedings we do not presently expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

on december 14 2016 two of our subsidiaries received subpoenas from the us department of justice antitrust division concerning its ongoing investigation of video production and postproduction practices in the advertising industry the company is fully cooperating with the investigation while the ultimate effect of the investigation is inherently uncertain we do not at this time believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position however the ultimate resolution of these matters could be different from our current assessment and the differences could be material

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company providing advertising marketing and corporate communications services to clients through our branded networks and agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our networks and agencies provide a comprehensive range of services in the following fundamental disciplines advertising crmwhich as described below includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations and healthcare our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our networks and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients our fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model requires that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure this collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and comprehensive manner we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets and have a large and diverse client base in 2017  our largest client represented 30  of revenue and our 100 largest clients which represent many of the worlds major marketers comprised approximately 51  of revenue our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy with no one industry comprising more than 14  of our revenue in 2017  although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

as described in more detail below in 2017  our revenue decreased   1433 million  or 09  compared to 2016  changes in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted revenue in the first six months of 2017  beginning in the third quarter of 2017  the euro and a number of other foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar as a result changes in foreign exchange rates for 2017  had a marginal effect on our revenue in 2017  changes in foreign exchange rates increased  revenue by 429 million  or 03  acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced  revenue 6473 million  or 42  primarily reflecting the sale of our specialty print media and organic growth increased  revenue 4611 million  or 30  

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services which would reduce the demand for our services in 2017  our agencies in north america continued their modest growth as activity in the united states varied across our service disciplines and growth slowed in the second half of the year relative to the first half our businesses in the united kingdom or the uk and europe had solid performance however while improving in 2017 the continuing uncertain economic and political conditions in the european union or the eu have been further complicated by the official notification from the uk to the european council to withdraw from the eu in brazil unstable economic and political conditions contributed to the continuing volatility in the market and our agencies experienced negative growth most of our businesses in asia continue their modest growth consistent with recent periods the economic and fiscal issues facing countries in europe and latin america continue to cause economic uncertainty in those regions however the impact on our business varies by country we will continue to monitor economic conditions closely as well as client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage our working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions reductions in client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have made it a practice to consolidate their business within one service provider in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points we have structured our business around these trends we believe that our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions have provided a competitive advantage to our business in the past and we expect this to continue over the medium and long term in addition during 2017 we continued the process of forming practice areas within our global network structure to bring together agencies operating in common disciplines to leverage existing resources and to create in close coordination with our key client matrix organization additional custom client solutions we expect to complete this process in 2018 

in the near term barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates as a result of continued improvement in operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our 2018  revenue to increase modestly and over the long term to be in excess of the weighted average nominal gdp growth in our major markets we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities intended to build upon the core capabilities of our strategic disciplines and business platforms expand our operations in highgrowth and emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today in addition we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify nonstrategic or underperforming businesses for disposition 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we focus on are revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by principal regional market and marketing discipline the impact from foreign currency exchange rate changes growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients operating expenses are comprised of cost of services selling general and administrative or sga expenses and depreciation and amortization 

the change in revenue in 2017  across our principal regional markets were north america decreased   53  europe increased   57  latin america increased   168  and asia pacific increased   09  in north america modest growth in the united states and canada was offset by the disposition of our specialty print media business in the second quarter in europe growth in substantially all markets and the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar was partially offset by the weakening of the british pound against the us dollar the increase in revenue in latin america was a result of our acquisition activity in colombia growth in mexico and the strengthening of the brazilian real against the us dollar which was substantially offset by the continued economic weakness in brazil and negative performance in that market in asia pacific growth in most countries in the region especially australia india japan and singapore was partially offset by disposition activity 

in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to better capture the expanded scope of our services in the fourth quarter of 2017 we realigned our service disciplines as a result our crm discipline was grouped into two separate categories crm consumer experience which includes omnicom precision marketing group’s digital  direct marketing agencies as well as our branding agencies shopper marketing agencies and our experiential marketing agencies and crm execution  support which includes field marketing sales support merchandising and point of sale as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services also we realigned and renamed our former specialty communications discipline so that it now exclusively includes agencies offering healthcare marketing and communications services 

the change in revenue in 2017  compared to 2016  in our service disciplines was advertising decreased   06  crm consumer experience decreased   32  crm execution  support decreased   16  public relations increased   01  and healthcare increased   33  the decrease in advertising primarily reflects the sale of our specialty print media business in april 2017  

we measure cost of services in two distinct categories salary and service costs and occupancy and other costs as a service business salary and service costs make up the vast majority of our operating expenses and substantially all these costs comprise the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services salary and service costs include employee compensation and benefits freelance labor and direct service costs which include thirdparty supplier costs and clientrelated travel costs occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the delivery of our services including office rent and other occupancy costs equipment rent technology costs general office expenses and other expenses 

sga expenses primarily consist of thirdparty marketing costs professional fees and compensation and benefits and occupancy and other costs of our corporate and executive offices which includes groupwide finance and accounting treasury legal and governance human resource oversight and similar costs 

operating expenses for 2017   decreased   14  compared to 2016  salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue decreased   1909 million  or 17  in 2017  compared to 2016  occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs increased   15 million  or 01  in 2017  compared to 2016  operating profit increased 508 million  yearoveryear as a result operating margin increased  yearoveryear to 135  from 130  earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets or ebita margin in 2017  was 142  as compared to 138  in 2016  

net interest expense increased   77 million   yearoveryear to   1748 million  in 2017  interest expense increased   148 million   to   2245 million  in 2017  interest income increased   71 million  to 497 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law the tax act reduced the us federal statutory income tax rate to 21 from 35 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 and made several changes to existing tax law that affect our tax assets and liabilities related to previously reported taxable income the significant changes require that we record tax expense on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and adjust our previously reported deferred tax positions to reflect the impact of the revised statutory federal rate as of the enactment date in december 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 118  or sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the tax act sab 118 provides that provisional amounts should be recognized in our financial statements where accounting for certain effects of the tax act are not complete and a reasonable estimate of the effects of the tax act can be made accordingly at december 31 2017 we have estimated the effect of the tax act and recorded a net increase to income tax expense of 1063 million  our estimate is based on our understanding of the tax act and currently available guidance we expect to revise this estimate in future periods as further information becomes available see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate for 2017  was 369  compared to 326  for 2016  the increase  is attributable to the estimated impact of the tax act of 1063 million  partially offset by the recognition of an excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation of 208 million  resulting from the adoption of fasb asu 201609 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements asu 201609 requires that beginning in 2017  excess tax benefits and deficiencies arising from sharebased compensation be recognized in results of operations in the period when the restricted stock awards vest or stock options are exercised in prior years excess tax benefits and deficiencies from sharebased compensation were recorded in additional paidin capital the effect of the tax act on income tax expense for 2017 is presented below in results of operations 2017 compared to 2016 while we are still evaluating the impact of the tax act on our 2018 annual effective tax rate we expect the tax act to reduce our effective tax rate between 35 and 45 which excludes the impact of tax benefits or deficiencies on sharebased compensation at this point we can not predict the 2018 impact from sharebased compensation because it is subject to changes in our share price 

net income  omnicom group inc for 2017   decreased   602 million  or 52  to 10884 million  from 11486 million  in 2016  the yearoveryear decrease  is due to the impact of the tax act of 1063 million  which is partially offset by the after tax increase from the factors described above diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc decreased   27  to 465  in 2017  compared to 478  in 2016  the impact of the tax act reduced diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc 045  in addition the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock net of shares issued for restricted stock awards stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan improved diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc in 2017  compared to 2016  the effect of the tax act on net income  omnicom group inc and diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc is presented below in results of operations 2017 compared to 2016

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap and are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our equity method and cost method investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill 

we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions the evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation geographic coverage competitive position and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method the assets acquired including identified intangible assets liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values in circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100 of a business is acquired goodwill is recorded as if 100 were acquired acquisitionrelated costs including advisory legal accounting valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred certain acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts which are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in results of operations the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in results of operations from the acquisition date in 2017  we completed four  acquisitions of new subsidiaries 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach or their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the assets we acquire are intangible assets primarily consisting of the knowhow of the personnel which is treated as part of goodwill and under us gaap is not required to be valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets that are required to be valued separately a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable under fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to the goodwill impairment test although not required we performed the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five global agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our key client matrix organization structure for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and in fasb asc topic 350 consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and occupancy and other costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to 

personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our virtual client network strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions 

we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” 

the assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june 30 2017  and 2016  were 



long term growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets we operate in for the past ten years the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was approximately   36   and   35  respectively we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2017  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp we also believe based on our historical performance that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth in the markets we operate in which are similar across our reporting units for our annual test as of june 30 2017  we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 4  

when performing the annual impairment test as of june 30 2017  and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2017  in the first half of 2017  we experienced an increase in our revenue of 39  which excluded our net disposition activity and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates economic conditions in the euro zone are unsettled and the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the european union has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets during the first half of 2017  weakness in most latin american economies we operate in has the potential to affect our nearterm performance in that region we considered the effect of these conditions in our annual impairment test 

the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 

our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion 

based on the results of our impairment test we concluded that our goodwill at june 30 2017  was not impaired because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective net book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail the goodwill impairment test was approximately 72  notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used for wacc and longterm growth rate in our impairment testing are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june 30 2017  revealed that if the wacc increased by 1 andor the longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of its respective net book value and would pass the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test the estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be significant a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

subsequent to the annual impairment test at june 30 2017  and considering our operating performance in the second half of the year there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim impairment test additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 2  4  and 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition  and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins our principal source of revenue is derived from fees for services on a rate per hour or per project basis revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with the client arrangement and upon the completion of the earnings process our primary client arrangements include fixed fee contracts where revenue is recognized based on the level of effort completed to date retainer agreements where revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the contract period and media commissions where revenue is recognized when the media is run prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection must be reasonably assured these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines advertising crm which includes crm consumer experience and crm execution  support public relations and healthcare because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our service disciplines 

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned although in certain markets we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with thirdparty suppliers are excluded from our revenue in certain arrangements we act as principal and we contract directly with thirdparty suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are the primary obligor in these circumstances revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services 

some of our client arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize performance incentives in revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by the client we may receive rebates or credits from certain vendors based on transactions entered into on behalf of clients these rebates or credits are remitted to the clients in accordance with contractual requirements or in certain international markets may be retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

effective january 1 2018 we will adopt fasb asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers  or asc 606 as a result we will change our revenue recognition accounting policy as described below asc 606 will be applied using the modified retrospective method where the cumulative effect of the initial application is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at january 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position asc 606 provides a fivestep model where revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services the adoption of asc 606 will not have a material impact on how we recognize revenue for fixed fee or retainer based arrangements clients typically receive the benefit of our services as we perform we will continue to recognize revenue over time using inputs or outputs to measure our progress revenue for commission based arrangements will continue to be recognized at a pointintime asc 606 also includes additional disclosure requirements 

for certain of our businesses the adoption of asc 606 will result in a change in our accounting policy for certain thirdparty outofpocket costs which are incurred in connection with our services and are billed to clients the inclusion of thirdparty outofpocket costs in revenue depends on whether we act as a principal or agent in the client arrangement under asc 606 the principal versus agent assessment is based on whether we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer as a result of the adoption of asc 606 certain thirdparty costs are no longer included in revenue and cost of services in 2017 these thirdparty outofpocket costs were approximately 150 million this change will reduce reported revenue and will have no impact on operating profit 

in addition performance incentives that can increase revenue if we meet certain quantitative or qualitative objectives in delivering our services will be treated as variable consideration performance incentives were recognized in revenue when specific quantitative goals were achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals was acknowledged by the client under asc 606 variable consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method or the most likely method these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time this change will have offsetting effects in each period and the net effect will not be material to our results of operations or financial position 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law in accordance with the guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin 118  at december 31 2017 we made a reasonable estimate of the effect of the tax act on our results of operations and as a result we recorded a net increase to income tax expense of 1063 million  we expect to revise this estimate in future periods as further information becomes available see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

new accounting standards 

see note 20  for information on the adoption of new accounting standards and accounting standards not yet adopted 

results of operations  2017  compared to 2016  in millions 



as discussed below in 2017 the tax act reduced net income  omnicom group inc by 1063 million  and diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc by 045 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nongaap financial measures 

we use ebita and ebita margin as additional operating performance measures that exclude the noncash amortization expense of intangible assets which primarily consists of amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions we define ebita as earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets and ebita margin as ebita divided by revenue ebita and ebita margin are nongaap financial measures we believe that ebita and ebita margin are useful measures for investors to evaluate the performance of our business 

nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

the following table reconciles the us gaap financial measure of net income  omnicom group inc to ebita and ebita margin for the for the periods presented in millions 



revenue 

in 2017  revenue decreased   1433 million  to 152736 million  from 154169 million  in 2016  changes in foreign exchange rates increased  revenue by 429 million  or 03  acquisition revenue net of disposition revenue reduced  revenue 6473 million  or 42  reflecting the disposition of certain nonstrategic businesses in the past year and organic growth increased  revenue 4611 million  or 30  the reduction in revenue in 2017  resulting from our acquisition and disposition activity arose principally from the sale in the second quarter of our specialty print media business which operated in north america 

changes in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted revenue in the first six months of 2017  beginning in the third quarter of 2017  the euro and a number of foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar as a result changes in foreign exchange rates for 2017  had a marginal effect on our revenue the increase in revenue from changes in foreign exchange rates primarily resulted from the strengthening of the euro brazilian real australian dollar and russian ruble against the us dollar mostly offset by the weakening of the british pound against the us dollar 

the components of revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

 

 changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized assuming exchange rates at february 12 2018  remain unchanged we estimate the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to increase   2018  revenue by approximately 2  

revenue for 2017  and the percentage change in revenue and organic growth from 2016  in our principal regional markets were in millions 



our primary markets in europe comprise the uk and the euro zone in 2017  the uk comprised 91  of revenue and the euro zone and the other european countries together comprised 179  of revenue in 2017  revenue including the impact of foreign exchange rates decreased   09  in the uk and increased   94  in the euro zone and the other european countries 

in north america modest growth in the united states and canada was offset by the disposition of our specialty print media business in the second quarter in europe growth in substantially all markets and the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar was partially offset by the weakening of the british pound against the us dollar the increase in revenue in latin america was a result of our acquisition activity in colombia growth in mexico and the strengthening of the brazilian real against the us dollar which was substantially offset by the continued economic weakness in brazil and negative performance in that market in asia pacific growth in most countries in the region especially australia india japan and singapore was partially offset by disposition activity 

in the normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors the net change in 2017  was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients our largest client represented 30  of revenue in 2017  and 2016  our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 196  and 505  of revenue in 2017  respectively and 183  and 524  of revenue in 2016  respectively 

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives these services include advertising branding content marketing corporate social responsibility consulting crisis communications custom publishing data analytics database management

 in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to better capture the expanded scope of our services in the fourth quarter of 2017 we realigned our service disciplines as a result our crm discipline was grouped into two separate categories crm consumer experience which includes omnicom precision marketing group’s digital  direct marketing agencies as well as our branding agencies shopper marketing agencies and our experiential marketing agencies and crm execution  support which includes field marketing sales support merchandising and point of sale as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services also we realigned and renamed our former specialty communications discipline so that it now exclusively includes agencies offering healthcare marketing and communications services

operating expenses for 2017  compared to 2016  were in millions 



operating expenses decreased   1941 million  or 14  in 2017  compared to 2016  salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue decreased   1909 million  or 17  in 2017  compared to 2016  occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs increased   15 million  or 01  in 2017  compared to 2016  sga expenses increased   61 million  yearoveryear primarily related to professional fees operating profit increased 508 million  yearoveryear as a result operating margin increased  yearoveryear to 135  from 130  and ebita margin increased  yearoveryear to 142  from 138  

net interest expense 

net interest expense increased   77 million   yearoveryear to   1748 million   in   2017  i nterest expense increased   148 million  to 2245 million  in 2017  primarily due to a reduced benefit from the fixedtofloating interest rate swaps resulting from higher rates on the floating rate leg and higher interest expense on commercial paper our longterm debt portfolio at december 31 2017  after taking into consideration our outstanding interest rate swaps was approximately 75  fixed rate obligations and 25  floating rate obligations and was unchanged from december 31 2016  a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements in 2017  interest income increased   71 million  compared to the prior year resulting from higher interest earned on the cash held by our international treasury centers 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2017  was 369  compared to 326  for 2016  the increase  is attributable to the estimated impact of the tax act of 1063 million  partially offset by the recognition of an excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation of 208 million  resulting from the adoption of fasb asu 201609 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements asu 201609 requires that beginning in 2017  excess tax benefits and deficiencies arising from sharebased compensation be recognized in results of operations in the period when the restricted stock awards vest or stock options are exercised in prior years excess tax benefits and deficiencies from sharebased compensation were recorded in additional paidin capital the effect of the tax act on income tax expense for 2017 is presented below in results of operations 2017 compared to 2016 while we are still evaluating the impact of the tax act on our 2018 annual effective tax rate we expect the tax act to reduce our effective tax rate between 35 and 45 which excludes the impact of tax benefits or deficiencies on sharebased compensation at this point we can not predict the 2018 impact from sharebased compensation because it is subject to changes in our share price 

net income per share  omnicom group inc 

net income  omnicom group inc for 2017   decreased   602 million  or 52  to 10884 million  from 11486 million  in 2016  the yearoveryear decrease  is due to the impact of the tax act of 1063 million  which is partially offset by the after tax increase from the factors described above diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc decreased   27  to 465  in 2017  compared to 478  in 2016  the impact of the tax act reduced diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc 045  in addition the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock net of shares issued for restricted stock awards stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan improved diluted net income per share  omnicom group inc in 2017  compared to 2016

the components of revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

 

in 2016  changes in foreign exchange rates continued to negatively impact revenue but at a more moderate rate as compared to 2015  the impact of foreign exchange rates in 2016   reduced  revenue by 19  or 2838 million  while a number of currencies weakened against the us dollar including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar and russian ruble the most significant impact resulted from the weakening of the british pound

in north america moderate growth in the united states and strong growth in canada was partially offset by the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar in europe growth in the uk spain russia and italy was offset by the weakening of the british pound and russian ruble against the us dollar and negative performance in the netherlands the increase in revenue in latin america was a result of our acquisition activity in brazil which was partially offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar especially the brazilian real the continuing uncertainty in the economic and political climate in brazil resulted in organic revenue declines that partially offset the growth from our acquisition and also overshadowed strong growth in mexico in asia pacific growth in the major economies in the region was also partially offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements 

our primary liquidity sources are our operating cash flow cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments additional liquidity sources include our credit facilities and commercial paper program and access to the capital markets at december 31 2017  we have a 25 billion  revolving credit facility or credit facility expiring on july 31 2021  uncommitted domestic and international credit lines aggregating 12 billion  and the ability to issue up to 2 billion  of commercial paper our liquidity funds our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending 

working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations and contingent purchase price obligations earnouts from prior acquisitions our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend payments to common shareholders capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock as a result we typically have a shortterm borrowing requirement normally peaking during the second quarter of the year due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending for the next twelve months

our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia manage our cash and liquidity each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to issue up to a total of 2 billion  of us dollardenominated commercial paper or borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines this process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as manage our risk to foreign exchange rate imbalances in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines 

we have a policy governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each institution in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the credit facility these institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

at december 31 2017  our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 937 million  of our total cash and cash equivalents of 38 billion  the majority of the cash is available to us net of any foreign withholding taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our net debt position which we define as total debt including shortterm debt less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at december 31 2017   decreased   7982 million  as compared to december 31 2016  the decrease  in net debt is due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 7736 million  primarily arising from an increase  in operating capital of 3485 million  an increase in principal cash sources in excess of principal cash uses of 2600 million  and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of 2279 million  

the components of net debt at december 31 2017  and 2016  were in millions 



net debt is a nongaap liquidity measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap liquidity measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management nongaap liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

debt instruments and related covenants 

at december 31 2017  the total principal amount of our fixed rate senior notes was 49 billion  and the total notional amount of the outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swaps was 125 billion  the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our longterm debt portfolio to approximately 75  fixed rate obligations and 25  floating rate obligations a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

omnicom and its wholly owned finance subsidiary omnicom capital inc or oci are coobligors under all the senior notes the senior notes are a joint and several liability of us and oci and we unconditionally guarantee oci’s obligations with respect to the senior notes oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci’s assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of oci or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

  the credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12month period ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12month period  at december 31 2017  we were in compliance with these covenants as our leverage ratio was 21  times and our interest coverage ratio was 104  times the credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 

at december 31 2017  our longterm and shortterm debt was rated bbb  and a2  by sp and baa1  and p2  by moodys our access to the commercial paper market and the cost of these borrowings are affected by our credit ratings and market conditions our senior notes and credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event our credit ratings are downgraded 

credit markets and availability of credit 

we typically fund our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper additional liquidity sources include our credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines at december 31 2017  there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines 

commercial paper activity for the three years ended december 31 2017  was dollars in millions 



we expect to continue funding our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper however disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads to mitigate any future disruption in the credit markets and to fund our liquidity we may borrow under the credit facility or access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist we will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

in the normal course of business we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations at december 31 2017  were in millions 



certain acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts that are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in results of operations 

the tax act includes a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings after taking into consideration available foreign tax credits and other items we recorded a net cash liability of 1029 million  we will elect to pay the liability over an eightyear period see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and liability for our postemployment arrangements was  3244 million  at december 31 2017  in 2017  we contributed 83 million  to our defined benefit pension plans and paid  88 million  in benefits for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2018  

the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 

commercial commitments at december 31 2017  were in millions 



at december 31 2017  there were no significant offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we manage our exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk through various strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes using derivatives exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations we manage that risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivatives we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivatives by performing a valueatrisk or var analysis var is a statistical model that uses historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 95 confidence a maximum oneday change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2017  was not significant 

foreign exchange risk 

our international operations represent approximately 46  of our revenue changes in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar affect our results of operations and financial position for the most part because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized the effects of currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements 

while our major international markets include the euro zone the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies as an integral part of our global treasury operations we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pools to manage the foreign exchange risk that arises from imbalances between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds however in certain circumstances subsidiaries borrowing or investing with a treasury center operating in a different currency creates foreign exchange exposure to manage that risk we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 928 million  and 990 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively additionally there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts to manage that risk we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 1363 million  and 940 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the net fair value of the forward foreign contracts at december 31 2017  and 2016  was a current asset of 09 million  and a current liability of 11 million  respectively 

foreign currency derivatives are designated as economic hedges therefore any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures by using these financial instruments we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably the terms of our forward foreign exchange contracts are generally less than 90 days 

interest rate risk 

we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt based on market conditions we may terminate the swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates or to monetize any gain and lock in a reduction in interest expense over the term of the underlying debt at december 31 2017  the total notional amount of the outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swaps was 125 billion  the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our longterm debt portfolio to approximately 75  fixed rate obligations and 25  floating rate obligations a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients that operate in nearly every sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client represented 30  of revenue in 2017  however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn

 item 1 business 

our business 

omnicom is a strategic holding company and a leading global provider of advertising marketing and corporate communications services we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against other global national and regional advertising and marketing services companies the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and mediums has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to global service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditure 

our branded networks and agencies operate in all major global markets and provide a comprehensive range of services in four fundamental disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and specialty communications although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific advertising marketing and corporate communications services services in these disciplines include 



our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our networks and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to deliver our services and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model requires that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it differentiates us from our competitors 

 1 

 the networks and agencies that comprise our virtual client networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines and geographies meaning that the delivery of our services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously further we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for our services our overarching business strategy is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients 

the various components of our business including revenue by discipline and geographic area and material factors that affected us in 2016  are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or mda of this report none of the acquisitions or dispositions individually or in the aggregate in the three year period ended december 31 2016  was material to our results of operations or financial position for information about our acquisitions see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements 

geographic regions 

in 2016  our united states operations comprised approximately 56  of our revenue as discussed more fully in the critical accounting policies section of the mda our branded networks and agencies conduct business on a global basis and operate in the following geographic regions the americas which includes north america and latin america emea which includes europe the middle east and africa and asia pacific which includes australia china india japan korea new zealand singapore and other asian countries the networks have regional reporting units that are responsible for the agencies in their region agencies within the regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients and have similar economic characteristics accordingly financial information by geographic region is provided in the mda and note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

our clients 

our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy in many cases multiple agencies or networks serve different brand andor product groups within the same client for example in 2016  our largest client represented 30  of revenue and was served by more than 250  of our agencies our 100 largest clients which represent many of the worlds major marketers comprised approximately 52  of revenue and were each served on average by more than 50  of our agencies 

our employees 

at december 31 2016  we employed approximately 78500  people the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our client service professionals around this competency see the mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

adverse economic conditions a reduction in client spending a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

economic conditions have a direct impact on our business results of operations and financial position adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in revenue which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements in addition a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements which may not be available on favorable terms or at all even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital such actions may not be effective 

 in an economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 

clients periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive industry key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently particularly large multinational clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

our 100 largest clients comprised approximately 52  of our revenue in 2016  clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to acquire new clients and to retain existing clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business results of operations and financial position 

our international operations comprised approximately 44  of our revenue in 2016  we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly their financial statements are translated into us dollars as a result both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates would impact our business results of operations and financial position in addition funds transferred to the united states can be adversely or beneficially impacted by foreign currency exchange changes 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process store and transmit data summarize results manage our business and maintain client advertising and marketing information increased cybersecurity threats and attacks pose a risk to our systems and networks security breaches improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public we use thirdparty service providers including cloud providers to store transmit and process data we also may have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations despite our efforts to protect our systems and networks and sensitive and personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats such events could adversely affect our business and reputation 

government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs such regulation may seek among other things to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in highgrowth markets and developing countries which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions competition for new business and talented staff currency fluctuation political conditions regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations in addition we conduct business in numerous highgrowth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped vague inconsistently enforced retroactively applied or frequently changed the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally we are subject to us and international anticorruption and antibribery laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 in all jurisdictions where we operate these laws are complex and stringent and any violation of these laws could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation for financial information by geographic region see note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the process we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our business results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized knowhow of the acquired workforce as discussed in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

generally our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise although our businesses could be in the future however we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers further if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements either directly or indirectly their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs therefore at this time we cannot estimate what impact such regulations may have on our business results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company providing advertising marketing and corporate communications services to clients through our branded networks and agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our networks and agencies provide a comprehensive range of services in four fundamental disciplines advertising crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our networks and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model requires that multiple agencies collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our clients’ specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets and have a large and diverse client base in 2016  our largest client represented 30  of revenue and our 100 largest clients which represent many of the worlds major marketers comprised approximately 52  of revenue our business is spread across a number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 14  of our revenue in 2016  although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

 as described in more detail below in 2016  our revenue increased   2825 million  or 19  compared to 2015  beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing throughout 2015  substantially all foreign currencies weakened against the us dollar in 2016  while the strength of the us dollar moderated against a number of currencies the british pound weakened substantially against the us dollar in 2016  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue by 2838 million  or 19  acquisitions net of dispositions increased  revenue 382 million  or 03  and organic growth increased  revenue 5281 million  or 35  

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services which would reduce the demand for our services in 2016  the united states continued its modest economic growth uncertain economic and political conditions in the euro zone have resulted in uneven growth across the region and have been further complicated by the vote in 2016 in the united kingdom or uk to exit the european union in brazil unstable economic and political conditions contributed to the continuing downward economic trend that began in the second quarter of 2015  the major economies of asia had modest economic growth consistent with recent periods the economic and fiscal issues facing countries in europe and latin america continue to cause economic uncertainty in those regions however the impact on our business varies by country we will continue to monitor economic conditions closely as well as client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage our working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions reductions in client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing expenditures clients continue to require greater coordination of marketing activities we believe these trends have benefited our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 

in the near term barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates as a result of continued improvement in operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our 2017  revenue to increase modestly in excess of the weighted average nominal gdp growth in our major markets we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities intended to build upon the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms expand our operations in the highgrowth and emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today in addition we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify nonstrategic or under performing business for disposition 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we focus on are revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by principal regional market and marketing discipline the impact from foreign currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients operating expenses are comprised of cost of services selling general and administrative or sga expenses and depreciation and amortization 

in 2016  revenue increased   19  compared to 2015  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue 19  acquisitions net of dispositions increased  revenue 03  and organic growth increased  revenue 35  across our principal regional markets the changes in revenue were north america increased   16  europe decreased   10  latin america increased   284  and asia pacific increased   41  in north america moderate growth in the united states and strong growth in canada was partially offset by the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar in europe growth in the uk spain russia and italy was offset by the weakening of the british pound and russian ruble against the us dollar and negative performance in the netherlands the increase in revenue in latin america was a result of our acquisition activity in brazil which was partially offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar especially the brazilian real in asia pacific growth in the major economies in the region was also partially offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar the change in revenue in 2016  compared to 2015  including the negative impact of currency changes in our four fundamental disciplines was advertising increased   47  crm decreased   36  public relations increased   34  and specialty communications increased   39  

we measure cost of services in two distinct categories salary and service costs and occupancy and other costs as a service business salary and service costs make up the vast majority of our operating expenses and substantially all these costs comprise the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services salary and service costs include employee compensation and benefits freelance labor and direct service costs which include thirdparty supplier costs and clientrelated travel costs occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the delivery of our services including office rent and other occupancy costs equipment rent technology costs general office expenses and other expenses 

sga expenses primarily consist of thirdparty marketing costs professional fees and compensation and benefits and occupancy and other costs of our corporate and executive offices which includes groupwide finance and accounting treasury legal and governance human resource oversight and similar costs 

operating expenses increased   15  in 2016  compared to 2015  salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue increased   2045 million  or 18  in 2016  compared to 2015  occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs decreased   247 million  or 20  in 2016  compared to 2015  operating margin in 2016  was 130  as compared to 127  in 2015  earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets or ebita margin in 2016  was 138  as compared to 134  in 2015  

net interest expense for 2016   increased   256 million   to   1671 million   from   1415 million   in   2015  interest expense 

increased   286 million   to   2097 million  in 2016  primarily resulting from the reduced benefit of the 1 billion  fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the 3625 senior notes due 2022 or 2022 notes in january 2016  we settled the interest rate swap on the 2022 notes by settling the swap we were able to lock interest savings over the remaining term of the 2022 notes by reducing the effective rate to 27 from 35 on april 6 2016 we issued 14 billion principal amount of 360 senior notes due april 15 2026 or 2026 notes and a portion of the proceeds were used to retire the 10 billion  59 senior notes due 2016 or 2016 notes at maturity concurrent with the issuance of the 2026 notes we entered into a 500 million  fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the 2026 notes at december 31 2016  our debt portfolio was approximately 75  fixed rate obligations and 25  floating rate obligations as compared to 61  fixed rate and 39  floating rate at december 31 2015  and as a result in 2016  there was less floating rate benefit from the interest rate swaps interest income increased   30 million  to 426 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  as a result of higher cash balances in our international treasury centers available for investment 

our effective tax rate for 2016  was 326  compared to 328  for 2015  

net income  omnicom group inc for 2016   increased   547 million  or 50  to 11486 million  from 10939 million  in 2015  the yearoveryear increase  is due to the factors described above diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc increased   84  to 478  in 2016  compared to 441  in 2015  due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock net of shares issued for restricted stock awards and stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 

critical accounting policies 

the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes including note 2  significant accounting policies  for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our equity method and cost method investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill 

we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions the evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation geographic coverage competitive position and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method the assets acquired including identified intangible assets liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values in circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100 of a business is acquired goodwill is recorded as if 100 were acquired acquisitionrelated costs including advisory legal accounting valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred certain acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts which are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in results of operations the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in results of operations from the acquisition date in 2016  we completed 5  acquisitions of new subsidiaries 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach or their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the assets we acquire are intangible assets primarily consisting of the knowhow of the personnel which is treated as part of goodwill and under us gaap is not required to be valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets that are required to be valued separately a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable under fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to step 1 of the goodwill impairment test although not required we performed step 1 of the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and the guidance set forth in fasb asc topic 350 consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in 

similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and occupancy and other costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions 

we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” 

the assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june 30 2016  and 2015  were 



long term growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in for the past ten years the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was approximately   40   and   36  respectively we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2016  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp we also believe based on our historical performance that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth in the markets we operate in which are similar across our reporting units for our annual test as of june 30 2016  we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 4  

when performing the annual impairment test as of june 30 2016  and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2016  in the first half of 2016  we experienced an increase in our revenue of 36  which excluded growth from acquisitions and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates economic conditions in the euro zone are unsettled and the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the european union has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets during 2016  weakness in most latin american economies we operate in have the potential to affect our nearterm performance in that region we considered the effect of these conditions in our annual impairment test 

the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 

our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion 

based on the results of the step 1 impairment test we concluded that our goodwill at june 30 2016  was not impaired because the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its respective net book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test was approximately 77  notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used for wacc and longterm growth rate in our impairment testing are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june 30 2016  revealed that if the wacc increased by 1 andor the longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of its respective net book value and would pass step 1 of the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test the estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step 1 of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

subsequent to the annual impairment test at june 30 2016  there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim impairment test additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 2  4  and 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition  and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services based on a rate per hour or equivalent basis revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with the client arrangement and upon the completion of the earnings process our primary client arrangements include fixed fee contracts where revenue is recognized based on the level of effort completed to date retainer agreements where revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the contract period and media commissions where revenue is recognized when the media is run prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection must be reasonably assured these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines advertising crm public relations and specialty communications because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned although in certain markets we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with thirdparty suppliers are excluded from our revenue in certain arrangements we act as principal and we contract directly with thirdparty suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are the primary obligor in these circumstances revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services 

some of our client arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize performance incentives in revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by the client we may receive rebates or credits from certain vendors based on transactions entered into on behalf of clients these rebates or credits are remitted to the clients or in certain international markets may be retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers “asu 201409”  which will replace all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap on july 9 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date of asu 201409 to all annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 asu 201409 provides for one of two methods of transition retrospective application to each prior period presented or recognition of the cumulative effect of retrospective application of the new standard as of the beginning of the period of initial application we plan to apply asu 201409 on january 1 2018 presently we are not yet in a position to conclude on the transition method we will choose based on our initial assessment the impact of the application of the new standard will likely result in a change in the timing of our revenue recognition for performance incentives received from clients performance incentives are currently recognized in revenue when specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by the client under the new standard we will be required to estimate the amount of the incentive that will be earned at the inception of the contract and recognize the incentive over the term of the contract while performance incentives are not material to our revenue this will result in an acceleration of revenue recognition for certain contract incentives compared to the current method additionally in certain of our businesses we record revenue as a principal and include certain thirdparty passthrough and outofpocket costs which are billed to clients in connection with our services in revenue in march 2016 the fasb issued further guidance on principal versus agent considerations we are currently evaluating the impact of the principal versus agent guidance on our revenue and cost of services however we do not expect the change if any to have a material effect on our results of operations 

additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

the majority of our incentive based share awards represent restricted stock awards and performance restricted stock awards or prsus sharebased compensation for these awards is determined and fixed on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock and we have assumed that substantially all the prsus will vest 

sharebased compensation expense of 934 million  994 million  and 935 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively primarily resulted from restricted stock awards information about our stock award plans can be found in note 9  to the consolidated financial statements

revenue 

in 2016  revenue increased   2825 million  to 154169 million  from 151344 million  in 2015  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue 2838 million  acquisitions net of dispositions increased  revenue 382 million  and organic growth increased  revenue 5281 million  

the components of revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

 

in 2016  changes in foreign exchange rates continued to negatively impact revenue but at a more moderate rate as compared to 2015  the impact of foreign exchange rates in 2016   reduced  revenue by 19  or 2838 million  while a number of currencies weakened against the us dollar including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar and russian ruble the most significant impact resulted from the weakening of the british pound 

our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in their local currency however for the most part because the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized assuming exchange rates at february 6 2017  remain unchanged we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce   2017  revenue by approximately 125  

revenue and organic growth for 2016  and the change in revenue from 2015  in our principal regional markets were in millions 



our primary markets in europe comprise the uk and the euro zone in 2016  the uk comprised 91  of revenue and the euro zone and the other european countries together comprised 162  of revenue in 2016  revenue decreased   68  in the uk and increased   26  in the euro zone and the other european countries 

in north america moderate growth in the united states and strong growth in canada was partially offset by the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar in europe growth in the uk spain russia and italy was offset by the weakening of the british pound and russian ruble against the us dollar and negative performance in the netherlands the increase in revenue in latin america was a result of our acquisition activity in brazil which was partially offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar especially the brazilian real the continuing uncertainty in the economic and political climate in brazil resulted in organic revenue declines that partially offset the growth from our acquisition and also overshadowed strong growth in mexico in asia pacific growth in the major economies in the region was also partially offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the us dollar 

in the normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors the net change in 2016  was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients our largest client represented 30  and 27  of revenue in 2016  and 2015  respectively our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 183  and 524  of revenue in 2016  respectively and 179  and 523  of revenue in 2015  respectively

revenue 

in 2015  revenue decreased   1834 million  to 151344 million  from 153178 million  in 2014  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue 10 billion  acquisitions net of dispositions increased  revenue by 146 million  and organic growth increased  revenue 8108 million  

the components of revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

 

in 2015  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue by 66  or 10 billion  compared to 2014  substantially all currencies have weakened against the us dollar with the most significant impacts resulting from the weakening of the euro and british pound as well as the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar and russian ruble 

revenue and organic growth for 2015  and the change in revenue from 2014  in our principal regional markets were in millions 



our primary markets in europe comprise the uk and the euro zone in 2015  the uk comprised 100  of revenue and the euro zone and the other european countries together comprised 161  of revenue in 2015  revenue increased   02  in the uk and decreased   143  in the euro zone and the other european countries 

 in north america moderate growth in the united states and canada was partially offset by the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar in europe growth in the uk germany and spain was offset by the weakening of all major european currencies against the us dollar and negative performance in the netherlands and france the decrease in revenue in latin america was a result of the weakening of all currencies in the region and negative performance in chile and brazil which offset strong growth in mexico in brazil the decline resulted from a difficult comparison to the prior year period which included additional client spending related to the world cup primarily in the second quarter of 2014  and a decline in economic conditions that began in 2015  in asia pacific strong growth in the major economies in the region was offset by the weakening of the currencies in the region 

in the normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors the net change in 2015  was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients our largest client represented 27  and 26  of our revenue in 2015  and 2014  respectively our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 179  and 523  of revenue in 2015  respectively and 181  and 504  of revenue in 2014  respectively 

revenue for 2015  and 2014  and the change in revenue and organic growth from 2014  by discipline were in millions 



we provide services to clients that operate in a number of industry sectors revenue by sector for 2015  and 2014  was 



operating expenses 

operating expenses for 2015  compared to 2014  were in millions 



operating expenses decreased   1594 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue increased   32 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  reflecting growth in revenue and increases related to changes in the mix of our business during the period occupancy and other costs which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs decreased   1139 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  reflecting the continuing effort by our agencies to reduce operating costs sga expenses decreased   454 million  yearoveryear primarily related to a reduction in professional fees as a result operating margin and ebita margin were unchanged yearoveryear at 127  and 134  respectively 

net interest expense 

net interest expense increased   74 million to   1415 million   in   2015   from   1341 million   in   2014 interest expense increased 39 million to 1811 million in 2015 primarily resulting from the interest expense on the 2024 notes issued in october 2014 partially offset by the benefit of the interest rate swaps on the 2022 notes and 2020 notes interest income decreased   35 million to 396 million in 2015 resulting from lower interest earned on cash balances in our international treasury centers and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

in october 2015 we terminated the swap on the 2020 notes and reduced the swap on the 2022 notes to 1 billion additionally we entered into a 750 million fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the 2024 notes 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 328  and was in line with the prior year which included the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately 11 million  related to expenses incurred in connection with a proposed merger with publicis groupe sa or publicis the merger was terminated in may 2014 

net income per common share  omnicom group inc

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements 

our primary source of liquidity is operating cash flow in addition to our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments additional liquidity sources include a 25 billion  revolving credit facility or credit facility uncommitted domestic and international credit lines the ability to issue up to 2 billion  of commercial paper and access to the capital markets these sources of liquidity fund our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending 

working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations and contingent purchase price obligations earnouts from prior acquisitions our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend payments to common shareholders capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock as a result we typically have a shortterm borrowing requirement normally peaking during the second quarter of the year primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending through 2017 our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments access to the commercial paper market credit facility uncommitted credit lines and access to the capital markets provide additional sources of liquidity 

cash and cash equivalents increased   3970 million  from december 31 2015  the components of the increase  were 



principal cash sources and principal cash uses amounts are nongaap liquidity measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful to understand the primary sources and uses of our cash flow and the effect on our cash and cash equivalents nongaap liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

cash management 

our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia manage our cash and liquidity each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to issue up to a total of 2 billion  of us dollardenominated commercial paper or borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines this process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as manage our risk to foreign exchange rate imbalances in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines 

we have policies governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each institution in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the credit facility these institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

at december 31 2016  our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 899 million  of our total cash and cash equivalents of 30 billion  the majority of the cash is available to us net of any taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states changes in international tax rules or changes in us tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

our net debt position which we define as total debt including shortterm debt less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at december 31 2016   decreased   246 million  as compared to december 31 2015  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased   4031 million  which was substantially offset by a net increase in our senior notes and shortterm debt 

the components of net debt at december 31 2016  and 2015  were in millions 



net debt is a nongaap liquidity measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap liquidity measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management nongaap liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

debt instruments and related covenants 

 at december 31 2016  our shortterm liquidity sources include the 25 billion  credit facility expiring on july 31 2021  domestic and international uncommitted credit lines aggregating 11 billion  and the ability to issue up to 2 billion  of commercial paper 

the credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12month period ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12month period at december 31 2016  we were in compliance with these covenants as our leverage ratio was 22  times and our interest coverage ratio was 110  times the credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 

on april 6 2016 we issued 14 billion  principal amount of 2026 notes and a portion of the proceeds were used to retire the 2016 notes at maturity concurrent with the issuance of the 2026 notes we entered into a 500 million  fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the 2026 notes 

at december 31 2016  the total principal amount of our fixed rate senior notes was 49 billion  and the total amount of the fixedtofloating interest rate swaps was 125 billion  the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our debt portfolio to approximately 75  fixed rate obligations and 25  floating rate obligations a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

omnicom and its wholly owned finance subsidiary omnicom capital inc or oci are coobligors under all the senior notes the senior notes are a joint and several liability of us and oci and we unconditionally guarantee oci’s obligations with respect to the senior notes oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci’s assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of oci or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

credit markets and availability of credit 

we typically fund our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper as an additional source of liquidity we may borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines at december 31 2016  there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines 

commercial paper activity for the three years ended december 31 2016  was dollars in millions 



at december 31 2016  our longterm and shortterm debt was rated bbb  and a2  by sp and baa1  and p2  by moodys our access to the commercial paper market and the cost of these borrowings are affected by our credit ratings and market conditions our senior notes and credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event our debt credit ratings are downgraded 

we expect to continue funding our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper however disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads to mitigate any future disruption in the credit markets and to fund our liquidity we may borrow under the credit facility or access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist we will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

in the normal course of business we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations at december 31 2016  were in millions 



certain acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts that are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in results of operations 

the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and liability for our postemployment arrangements was  3028 million  at december 31 2016  in 2016  we contributed 66 million  to our defined benefit pension plans and paid  92 million  in benefits for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2017  

the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 

commercial commitments at december 31 2016  were in millions 



at december 31 2016  there were no significant offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we manage our exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk through various strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense and structure our debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes utilizing derivative instruments exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate counterparty credit risk we have a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a valueatrisk or var analysis var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 95 confidence a maximum oneday change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2016  was not significant 

foreign exchange risk 

our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in their local currency however for the most part because the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized the effects of currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements 

our international operations represent approximately 44  of our revenue while our major international markets include the euro zone the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies 

 as an integral part of our global treasury operations we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pools to manage the foreign exchange risk that arises from imbalances between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds however in certain circumstances subsidiaries borrowing or investing with a treasury center operating in a different currency creates foreign exchange exposure at december 31 2016  and 2015  we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 990 million  and 221 million  respectively to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these activities additionally there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2016  and 2015  we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 940 million  and 859 million  respectively to manage the foreign exchange risk of these activities the fair value of the forward foreign contracts at december 31 2016  and 2015  was a net liability of 11 million  and 01 million  respectively 

foreign currency derivative instruments are designated as economic hedges therefore any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures by using these financial instruments we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 

interest rate risk 

we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt based on market conditions we may terminate the swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates or to monetize any gain and lock in a reduction in interest expense over the term of the underlying debt at december 31 2016  the total principal amount of our fixed rate senior notes was 49 billion  and the total amount of the fixedtofloating interest rate swaps was 125 billion  the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our debt portfolio to approximately 75 fixed rate obligations and 25 floating rate obligations a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client represented 30  of revenue in 2016  however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn

 item 1 business 

our business 

omnicom which was formed in 1986 is a strategic holding company and a leading global provider of advertising marketing and corporate communications services we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against other global advertising and marketing services companies as well as other independent companies the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and mediums has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to global service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditure 

our branded networks and agencies which operate in all major markets around the world provide a comprehensive range of services in four fundamental disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and specialty communications although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific advertising and marketing services services included in these four disciplines are 



our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our networks and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to deliver our services and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model requires that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it differentiates us from our competitors 

 1 

 our networks and agencies that comprise our virtual client networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines and geographies meaning that the delivery of our services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously further we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for our services our overarching business strategy is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients 

the various components of our business including revenue by discipline and geographic area and material factors that affected us in 2015  are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or mda of this report none of the acquisitions or dispositions individually or in the aggregate in the three year period ended december 31 2015  was material to our results of operations or financial position for information about our acquisitions see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements 

geographic regions 

in 2015  our united states operations represented approximately 56  of our revenue as discussed more fully in the critical accounting policies section of the mda our branded networks and agencies conduct business on a global basis and operate in the following geographic regions the americas which includes north america and latin america emea which includes europe the middle east and africa and asia pacific which includes australia china india japan korea new zealand singapore and other asian countries the networks have regional reporting units that are responsible for the agencies in their region agencies within the regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients and have similar economic characteristics accordingly we provide financial information by geographic region in the mda and in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements and segment information in note 7  

our clients 

our clients operate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy in many cases multiple agencies or networks serve different brand andor product groups within the same client for example in 2015  our largest client which represented 27  of revenue was served by more than 250  of our agencies and our 100 largest clients which represented approximately 52  of revenue were each served on average by more than 50  of our agencies 

our employees 

at december 31 2015  we employed approximately 74900  people the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our client service professionals around this competency see the mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

adverse economic conditions a reduction in client spending a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

adverse economic conditions have a direct impact on our business results of operations and financial position in particular a global or regional economic downturn poses a risk that clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in revenue which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position adverse economic conditions including a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements and such events could cause our clients to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements which may not be available on favorable terms or at all even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions and reductions in revenue by aligning our cost structure and managing our working capital such actions may not be effective 

 in an economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 

clients periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive industry key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently particularly large multinational clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in 2015  approximately 52  of our revenue came from our 100 largest clients clients generally are able to reduce or cancel their current or future spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to acquire new clients and to retain existing clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business results of operations and financial position 

our international operations represent approximately 44  of our revenue we operate in all major international markets including the european union the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly their financial statements are translated into us dollars as a result both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates would impact our business results of operations and financial position 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process store and transmit data including personally identifiable information summarize results and manage our business including maintaining client advertising and marketing information our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public additionally we use third parties including cloud providers to store transmit or process data there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems or in the systems of third parties we use and such events could adversely affect our reputation or business 

government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs such regulation may seek among other things to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services any limitation or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in highgrowth markets and developing countries which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we face a number of risks associated with a global business the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to global and regional economic conditions competition for new business and talented staff currency fluctuation political conditions regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations in addition we conduct business in numerous highgrowth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped vague inconsistently enforced retroactively applied or frequently changed the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally we are subject to us and international anticorruption and antibribery laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 in all jurisdictions where we operate these laws are complex and stringent and any violation of these laws could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation for financial information by geographic region see note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the evaluation we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our business results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill may become impaired which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions a substantial portion of which represents the specialized knowhow of the acquired workforce as discussed in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

generally our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise although our businesses could be in the future however we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers further if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements either directly or indirectly their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs therefore at this time we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our business results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company providing advertising marketing and corporate communications services to clients through our branded networks and agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our networks and agencies provide a comprehensive range of services in four fundamental disciplines advertising crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our networks and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model requires that multiple agencies collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our clients’ specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets and have a large and diverse client base in 2015  our largest client accounted for 27  of our revenue and our 100 largest clients accounted for approximately 52  of our revenue our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 13  of our revenue in 2015  although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

 as described in more detail below in 2015  our revenue decreased   1834 million  or 12  compared to 2014  beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014  and continuing throughout 2015  substantially all foreign currencies weakened against the us dollar changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue by 10 billion  or 66  acquisitions net of dispositions increased  revenue 146 million  or 01  and organic growth increased  revenue 8108 million  or 53  

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance in particular a contraction in global or regional economic conditions poses a risk that our clients may reduce postpone or cancel spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services which would reduce the demand for our services in 2015  the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia continued their moderate expansion economic conditions in the euro zone remain unsettled and economic conditions in brazil continued a downward trend that began in the second quarter of 2015  the economic and fiscal issues facing certain countries in the euro zone continue to cause economic uncertainty in that market however the impact on our business varies by country we will continue to monitor economic conditions closely as well as client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage our working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions reductions in client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing expenditures clients continue to require greater coordination of marketing activities we believe these trends have benefited our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 

in the near term barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates as a result of continued improvement in operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our 2016  revenue to increase modestly in excess of the weighted average nominal gdp growth in our major markets we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities intended to build upon the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we focus on are revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by principal regional market growth by marketing discipline impact from foreign currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients 

in 2015  our revenue decreased   12  compared to 2014  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue 66  acquisitions net of dispositions increased  revenue 01  and organic growth increased  revenue 53  across our principal regional markets the changes in revenue were north america increased   41  europe decreased   93  latin america decreased   25  and asia pacific decreased   2  in north america moderate growth in the united states and canada was partially offset by the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar in europe growth in the uk germany and spain was offset by the weakening of all major european currencies against the us dollar and negative performance in the netherlands and france the decrease in revenue in latin america was a result of the weakening of all currencies in the region and negative performance in chile and brazil which offset strong growth in mexico in brazil the decline resulted from a difficult comparison to the prior year period which included additional client spending related to the world cup primarily in the second quarter of 2014  and a recent decline in economic conditions in asia pacific strong growth in the major economies in the region was offset by the weakening of the currencies in the region the change in revenue in 2015  compared to 2014  including the negative impact of currency changes in our four fundamental disciplines was advertising increased   18  crm decreased   56  public relations decreased   23  and specialty communications increased   08  

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs consist of employee compensation including freelance labor and related costs and direct service costs office and general expenses consist of rent and occupancy costs technology costs depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses each of our agencies requires professionals with the skill sets that are common across our disciplines at the core of the skill sets is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software 

similar to revenue operating expenses decreased in 2015  compared to 2014  as a result of the weakening of substantially all foreign currencies against the us dollar salary and service costs which normally tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue increased   119 million  or 01  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily reflecting increases related to changes in the mix of our business during the period office and general expenses which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs decreased   1713 million  or 85  in 2015  compared to 2014  

 operating margins and earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets or ebita margins were unchanged  yearoveryear at 127  and 134  respectively 

net interest expense for 2015   increased   74 million   to   1415 million   from   1341 million   in   2014  interest expense 

increased   39 million   to   1811 million  in 2015  primarily resulting from the interest expense on the 750 million  principal amount of the 365 senior notes due 2024  or 2024 notes issued in october 2014  partially offset by the benefit of the interest rate swaps on the 3625 senior notes due 2022 or 2022 notes and the 445 senior notes due 2020 or 2020 notes interest income decreased   35 million  to 396 million  in 2015  resulting from lower interest earned on cash balances in our international treasury centers and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

our effective tax rate was unchanged  at 328  income tax expense for 2014  reflects the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately 11 million  related to expenses incurred in prior periods in connection with the proposed merger with publicis which was terminated on may 8 2014 prior to the termination of the merger the majority of the merger costs which were incurred in 2013 were capitalized for income tax purposes and the related tax benefits were not recorded because the proposed merger was terminated the merger costs were no longer required to be capitalized for income tax purposes excluding the income tax effect of the merger expenses income tax expense for 2014  would have been 6045 million the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2015  from the effective tax rate in 2014  excluding the income tax benefit related to the proposed merger is primarily due to a legal entity restructuring of our european operations as a result of the reorganization a certain portion of the foreign earnings in the affected countries is subject to lower effective tax rates 

net income  omnicom group inc for 2015   decreased   101 million  or 09  to 10939 million  from 11040 million  in 2014  the yearoveryear decrease  is due to the factors described above diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc increased   40  to 441  in 2015  compared to 424  in 2014  due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock net of shares issued for stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 

critical accounting policies 

the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes including note 2  significant accounting policies  for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our equity method and cost method investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill 

we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions the valuation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation geographic coverage competitive position and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method the assets acquired including identified intangible assets liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values in circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100 of a business is acquired goodwill is recorded as if 100 were acquired acquisitionrelated costs including advisory legal accounting valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred certain acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts which are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in results of operations the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in results of operations from the acquisition date in 2015  we completed 8  acquisitions of new subsidiaries 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach or their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the knowhow of the people which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and the guidance set forth in fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions 

we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” 

the assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june 30 2015  and 2014  were 



long term growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in for the past ten years the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was approximately   48   and   40  respectively we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2015  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp we also believe based on our historical performance that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth in the markets we operate in for our annual test as of june 30 2015  we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 4  for our reporting units 

when performing the annual impairment test as of june 30 2015  and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2015  in the first half of 2015  we experienced an increase in our revenue of 52  which excludes growth from acquisitions and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates economic conditions in the euro zone are unsettled and the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the european union has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets during 2015  weakness in most latin american economies we operate in has the potential to affect our nearterm performance in that region we considered the effect of these conditions in our annual impairment test 

the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 

our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion 

under us gaap we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to step 1 of the goodwill impairment test although not required we performed step 1 of the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill based on the results of our impairment test we concluded that our goodwill at june 30 2015  was not impaired because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective net book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test was approximately 74  notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used for wacc and longterm growth rate in our impairment testing are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june 30 2015  revealed that if the wacc increased by 1 andor the longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of its respective net book value and would pass step 1 of the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test the estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step 1 of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

subsequent to the annual impairment test at june 30 2015  there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim impairment test additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 2  4  and 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition  and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services based on a rate per hour or equivalent basis revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with the client arrangement and upon the completion of the earnings process prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection must be reasonably assured these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines advertising crm public relations and specialty communications certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements 

because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned although in certain markets we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with thirdparty suppliers are excluded from our revenue in certain arrangements we act as principal and we contract directly with thirdparty suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are the primary obligor in these circumstances revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services 

some of our client arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize performance incentives in revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by the client we may receive rebates or credits from certain vendors based on transactions entered into on behalf of clients these rebates or credits are remitted to the clients or retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

in may 2014 the fasb issued fasb asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers    or   asu 201409  which will replace all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap on july 9 2015 the fasb approved a one year deferral of the effective date of asu 201409 to all annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early application permitted only for annual and interim periods beginning after december 31 2016 asu 201409 provides for one of two methods of transition retrospective application to each prior period presented or recognition of the cumulative effect of retrospective application of the new standard as of the beginning of the period of initial application presently we are not yet in a position to conclude on the application date or the transition method we will choose while our implementation effort is ongoing based on our initial assessment the impact of the application of the new standard will likely result in a change in the timing of our revenue recognition for performance incentives received from clients and the recognition of certain reimbursable outofpocket costs as revenue performance incentives are currently recognized in revenue when specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by the client under the new standard we will be required to estimate the amount of the incentive that will be earned at the inception of the contract and recognize the incentive over the term of the contract while performance incentives are not material to our revenue this will result in an acceleration in revenue recognition for certain contract incentives compared to the current method certain incidental costs that are reimbursed by our clients and are currently required to be recorded in revenue will likely not be recorded as revenue under the new standard we expect this will result in less revenue and related cost recorded in our results of operations while we have not yet completed our assessment we do not expect this change to have a material impact to our revenue and it will not result in any change to operating income 

additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

the majority of our incentive based share awards represent restricted stock awards and performance restricted stock awards or prsus sharebased compensation for these awards is determined and fixed on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock and we assume that substantially all the prsus will vest 

sharebased compensation expense of 994 million  935 million  and 863 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively was primarily attributed to restricted stock awards information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 9  to the consolidated financial statements

revenue 

in 2015  revenue decreased   1834 million  or 12  to 151344 million  from 153178 million  in 2014  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue 10 billion  acquisitions net of dispositions increased  revenue 146 million  and organic growth increased  revenue 8108 million  

the components of 2015  revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

 

for the year ended december 31 2015  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue by 66  or 10 billion  compared to 2014  substantially all currencies have weakened against the us dollar with the most significant impacts resulting from the weakening of the euro and british pound as well as the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar and russian ruble 

our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in their local currency however for the most part because the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency the economic impact on operating margin is minimized assuming exchange rates at february 8 2016  remain unchanged we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce 2016  revenue by approximately 20  

revenue for 2015  and the percentage change in revenue and organic growth from 2014  in our principal regional markets were in millions 



europe comprises the uk and the euro currency countries and other european countries that have not adopted the european union monetary standard in 2015  the percentage of revenue attributed to the uk and to the euro currency and other european countries was 100  and 161  respectively in 2015  revenue increased   02  in the uk and revenue decreased   143  in the euro currency and other european countries 

in north america moderate growth in the united states and canada was partially offset by the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar in europe growth in the uk germany and spain was offset by the weakening of all major european currencies against the us dollar and negative performance in the netherlands and france the decrease in revenue in latin america was a result of the weakening of all currencies in the region and negative performance in chile and brazil which offset strong growth in mexico in brazil the decline resulted from a difficult comparison to the prior year period which included additional client spending related to the world cup primarily in the second quarter of 2014  and a recent decline in economic conditions in asia pacific strong growth in the major economies in the region was offset by the weakening of the currencies in the region

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements 

our primary source of liquidity is operating cash flow in addition to our cash and cash equivalents additional liquidity sources include access to the commercial paper market our 25 billion  revolving credit facility or credit facility uncommitted domestic and international credit lines and access to the capital markets these sources of liquidity fund our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending 

working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes including the repayment of the 1 billion  59 senior notes due april 15 2016  or 2016 notes recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations and contingent purchase price obligations earnouts from prior acquisitions our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend payments to common shareholders capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock we have a shortterm borrowing requirement normally peaking during the second quarter of the year primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our nondiscretionary cash requirements excluding the repayment of the 2016 notes and our discretionary spending through 2016 our cash and cash equivalents access to the commercial paper market credit facility uncommitted credit lines and access to the capital markets provide additional sources of liquidity as well as providing funding for the repayment of the 2016 notes 

 our cash and cash equivalents increased   2171 million  to 26 billion  at december 31 2015  from 24 billion  at december 31 2014  the components of the increase  for 2015  are in millions 



principal cash sources and principal cash uses amounts are nongaap financial measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our statement of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful to understand the primary sources and uses of our cash flow and the effect on our cash and cash equivalents nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

cash management 

our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia which are structured as wholly owned finance subsidiaries manage our cash and liquidity each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to issue up to a total of 2 billion  of us dollardenominated commercial paper or borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines this process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as manage our risk to foreign exchange rate changes in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines 

we have policies governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each institution in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the credit facility these institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

our net debt position which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased   2083 million  at december 31 2015  as compared to december 31 2014  primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments resulting from an increase in operating capital of 5576 million  partially offset by a decrease in foreign cash balances of 2626 million  from the translation of local currencies to us dollars and principal cash uses in excess of principal cash sources of 439 million  as described above the components of net debt at december 31 2015  and 2014  were in millions 



net debt is a nongaap financial measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap measures reflects one of the key metrics we use to assess our cash management performance nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

at december 31 2015  our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 14 billion  of our total cash and cash equivalents of 26 billion  the majority of the cash is available to us net of any taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states changes in international tax rules or changes in us tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

debt instruments and related covenants 

 at december 31 2015  as a source of shortterm financing we have a 25 billion  credit facility which expires on july 31 2020  domestic and international uncommitted credit lines aggregating 12 billion  and we can issue up to 2 billion  of commercial paper 

the credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12month period ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12month period at december 31 2015  we were in compliance with these covenants as our leverage ratio was 21  times and our interest coverage ratio was 122  times the credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 

omnicom and its wholly owned finance subsidiary omnicom capital inc or oci are coobligors under all the senior notes the senior notes are a joint and several liability of us and oci and we unconditionally guarantee oci’s obligations with respect to the senior notes oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci’s assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of oci or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

on march 26 2015  in connection with the maturity of our 2016 notes we entered into a 10 billion  forwardstarting interest rate swap the swap mitigates the risk of changes in the semiannual interest payments from inception to may 2 2016  the contractual termination date of the swap and effectively locks in the fixed interest rate excluding the effect of our credit spread on any refinancing at 232  in october 2015 we terminated the interest rate swap on the 2020 notes and reduced the notional amount of the interest rate swap on the 2022 notes to 10 billion  additionally in october 2015 we entered into a fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the 750 million  principal amount of our 2024 notes on january 19 2016 we terminated the remaining 10 billion  notional amount of the swap on the 2022 notes a complete discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

credit markets and availability of credit 

we typically fund our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper as an additional source of funding we may borrow under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines at december 31 2015  there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit facility or the uncommitted credit lines 

commercial paper activity for the three years ended december 31 2015  was dollars in millions 



our access to the commercial paper market and the cost of these borrowings are affected by our credit ratings and market conditions sp rates our longterm and shortterm debt bbb  and a2  respectively and moody’s rates our longterm and shortterm debt baa1  and p2  respectively our outstanding senior notes and credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event our debt credit ratings are downgraded 

we expect to continue funding our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper however disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads to mitigate any future disruption in the credit markets and to fund our liquidity we may borrow under the credit facility or access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist we will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets in such circumstances we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

in the normal course of business we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations at december 31 2015  were in millions

the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 

commercial commitments at december 31 2015  were in millions 



at december 31 2015  there were no significant offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we manage our exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk through various strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations additionally we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense and structure our debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes utilizing derivative instruments exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate counterparty credit risk we have a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a valueatrisk or var analysis var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 95 confidence a maximum oneday change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2015  was not significant 

foreign exchange risk 

our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in their local currency for the most part revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency which minimizes the economic impact on our operating margin the effects of currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements 

our international operations represent approximately 44 of our revenue while our major international markets include the european union the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies 

 as an integral part of our global treasury operations we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pools to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds however in certain circumstances subsidiaries borrow or invest with a treasury center operating in a different currency at december 31 2015  we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 221 million  to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these activities additionally there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts at december 31 2015  we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 859 million  to manage the foreign exchange risk of these activities 

foreign currency derivative instruments are designated as economic hedges therefore any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures by using these financial instruments we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 

interest rate risk 

we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our longterm debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt based on market conditions we may terminate the swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates or to monetize any gain and lock in a reduction in interest expense over the term of the underlying debt at december 31 2015  the total aggregate principal amount of our fixed rate senior notes was 45 billion  and the total notional amount of the fixedtofloating interest rate swaps was 175 billion  the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our debt portfolio to 61 fixed rate obligations and 39 floating rate obligations on january 19 2016 we terminated the remaining 10 billion  notional amount of the swap on the 2022 notes reducing the outstanding notional amount of the swaps to 750 million  

also we are exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances to manage this risk we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps to lock in the interest rate on future debt issuances at december 31 2015  the total notional amount of the forwardstarting interest rate swaps was 10 billion  upon settlement of the swap any gain or loss on the effective portion of the swap will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the new debt or will be recorded in results of operations if the refinancing is not completed 

a complete discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 27  of revenue in 2015  however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn

 item 1 business 

our business 

omnicom is a strategic holding company and was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies as a leading global provider of advertising marketing and corporate communications services we operate in a highly competitive industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and mediums has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures 

our branded networks and agencies operate in all major markets around the world and provide a comprehensive range of services which we group into four fundamental disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and specialty communications the services included in these disciplines are 



although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific advertising and marketing services 

our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to deliver our services and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model requires that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to 

 1 

execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it differentiates us from our competitors 

our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines and geographies this means that the delivery of our services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously further we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for our services our overarching business strategy is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients 

the various components of our business and material factors that affected us in 2014  are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or mda of this report none of our acquisitions or dispositions individually or in the aggregate in the three year period ended december 31 2014  was material to our financial position or results of operations for information concerning our acquisitions see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements

our clients 

our clients operate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy in many cases multiple agencies or networks serve different brand andor product groups within the same clients for example in 2014  our largest client was served by more than 200  of our agencies and represented 26  of revenue and no other client accounted for more than 25  of revenue in 2014  our top 100 clients ranked by revenue were each served on average by more than 50  of our agencies and collectively represented approximately 50  of revenue

 item 1a risk factors 

adverse global economic conditions could cause clients to reduce spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services and may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

adverse global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business results of operations and financial position in particular a contraction in global economic conditions poses a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services which could reduce the demand for our services if domestic or global economic conditions deteriorate our business results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected we will continue to monitor economic conditions closely client revenue levels and other factors and may take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital in response to reductions in client revenue there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions reductions in our client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

a reduction in client spending a delay in client payments or conditions in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

global economic uncertainty turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position such events could also lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with us and reduce spending on our services delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital in response we could need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements in such circumstances such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

in an economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable 

in the normal course of our business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition methods of managing the risk of payment defaults including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 

clients periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications services requirements and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

the markets we operate in are highly competitive and are expected to remain so key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to serve clients efficiently particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships the retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel including highly skilled technically proficient personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner our clients have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in 2014  approximately 50  of our revenue came from our 100 largest clients clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns or they could reduce future spending a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we rely extensively on information technology systems and cyber incidents could adversely affect us 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions summarize results and manage our business including maintaining client marketing and advertising information our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public additionally we utilize third parties including cloud providers to store transfer or process data while we have taken what we believe are prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems or in systems of third parties we use that could adversely affect our reputation or business 

government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs such regulation may seek among other things to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services any limitation or judicial action that effects our ability to meet our clients needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we face a number of risks associated with a global service business the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions competition for client assignments and talented staff new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations we also must comply with applicable us and international anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 which can be complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position for financial information by geographic region see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements 

we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries and highgrowth markets 

we conduct business in numerous developing countries and highgrowth markets around the world our operations outside the united states are exposed to risks that include slower receipt of payments social political and economic instability currency fluctuation and currency repatriation restrictions in addition commercial laws in developing countries and highgrowth markets can be undeveloped vague inconsistently enforced or frequently changed if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in countries and markets where we conduct business our prospects and business in those countries and markets could be harmed which could then have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 

standard and poor’s rating service or sp rates our longterm debt bbb  and moody’s investors service or moodys rates our longterm debt baa1  our shortterm debt ratings are a2  and p2  by the respective rating agencies our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our shortterm or longterm debt credit ratings 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the evaluation we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our business results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill may become impaired which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities which principally represents the specialized knowhow of the workforce at the acquired businesses as discussed in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

generally our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise although our businesses could be in the future however we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers further if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements either directly or indirectly their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs at this time we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our business results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company providing advertising marketing and corporate communications services to clients through multiple agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines advertising crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our clients’ specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 

on may 8 2014 the company and publicis entered into a termination agreement or termination agreement under which the company and publicis mutually agreed to terminate their proposed merger in view of difficulties in completing the transaction within a reasonable timeframe under the termination agreement the company and publicis mutually consented to terminate their business combination agreement dated july 27 2013 or business combination agreement governing the proposed combination of the parties’ respective businesses and mutually agreed to release each other from all claims obligations and liabilities arising out of in connection with or relating to the business combination agreement the termination agreement provided that no termination fee was payable by either party 

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets around the world and have a large and diverse client base in 2014  our largest client accounted for 26  of our revenue and no other client accounted for more than 25  of our revenue our top 100 clients accounted for approximately 50  of our revenue in 2014  our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 13  of our revenue in 2014  although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

for the year ended december 31 2014  as described in more detail below our revenue increased   50  compared to 2013  revenue increased in the united states 77  in europe revenue increased modestly for the year which reflects the strengthening of the british pound against the us dollar and a flat us dollar relative to the euro on a yearoveryear basis despite the weakening of the british pound and a significant weakening of the euro against the us dollar in the fourth quarter of 2014  for the year the russian rouble decreased significantly against the us dollar revenue increased moderately in most of our other markets but the rate of growth was significantly impacted by the weakening of most currencies in the fourth quarter against the us dollar 

in the fourth quarter of 2014  substantially all foreign currencies weakened against the us dollar as a result changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue in the fourth quarter by 31  or 1294 million  our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in their local currency for the most part revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency which minimizes the economic impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our results of operations assuming exchange rates at january 30 2015  remain unchanged we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce 2015  revenue by approximately 5  

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance in particular a contraction in global economic conditions poses a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising marketing and corporate communications services which could reduce the demand for our services in 2014  the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand economic conditions in the euro zone in 2014  were unsettled and the fiscal issues facing many countries in the european union continue to cause economic uncertainty in many of our euro zone markets we will continue to monitor economic conditions closely client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions reductions in our client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing expenditures clients continue to require greater coordination of marketing activities we believe these trends have benefited our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 

in the near term barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates as a result of continued improvement in operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our 2015  revenue to increase modestly in excess of the weighted average nominal gdp growth in our major markets we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities intended to build upon the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we focus on are revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by principal regional market growth by marketing discipline impact from foreign currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients in recent years our revenue has been divided almost evenly between our domestic and international operations 

in 2014  our revenue increased   50  compared to 2013  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue by 08  acquisitions net of dispositions increased  revenue 01  and organic growth increased  revenue 57  across our principal regional markets revenue increased   65  in north america 72  in the middle east and africa 41  in europe and 09  in asia and latin america the increase in revenue in europe was the result of growth in the uk spain and germany partially 

offset by reductions in several countries in the euro zone and the strengthening of the british pound against the us dollar revenue in asia pacific increased   14  compared to 2013  but the rate of growth was negatively impacted by the weakening of most currencies in that region against the us dollar the weakening of the currencies in latin america against the us dollar offset revenue growth in that region and revenue decreased   11  the increase in revenue in 2014  compared to 2013  in our four fundamental disciplines was advertising 81  crm 17  public relations 50  and specialty communications 11  

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs consist of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs office and general expenses consist of rent and occupancy costs technology costs depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses each of our agencies requires professionals with the skill sets that are common across our disciplines at the core of the skill sets is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are also similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software 

as a service business we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs in relation to revenue salary and service costs which tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue increased   6256 million  or 58  in 2014  compared to 2013  office and general expenses which are are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs decreased   111 million  or 05  in 2014  compared to 2013  

in 2014  and 2013  we incurred 88 million  and 414 million  respectively of expenses in connection with the proposed merger with publicis which were primarily comprised of professional fees on may 8 2014 the proposed merger was terminated excluding the merger expenses from both years office and general expenses for 2014   increased   215 million  compared to 2013  but decreased as a percentage of revenue reflecting our continuing efforts to control the cost structures of our agencies 

in 2014  operating margins increased  to 127  from 125  in 2013  excluding the merger expenses from both years operating income and operating margin for 2014  and 2013  were 19529 million  and 127  and 18667 million  and 128  respectively 

net interest expense decreased   303 million   to   1341 million   in   2014   from   1644 million   in   2013  in october 2014 we issued 750 million  of 365 senior notes due 2024 or 2024 notes on september 29 2014 we entered into an interest rate swap on the 445  senior notes due 2020 or 2020 notes in 2014  the benefit from the interest rate swap on the 2020 notes substantially offset the interest expense on the 2024 notes interest expense for 2014   decreased   200 million   to   1772 million  primarily resulting from the benefit from the interest rate swap on the 3625 senior notes due 2022 or 2022 notes entered into on may 1 2014 the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt interest income increased   103 million  to 431 million  in 2014  resulting from our cash management efforts and interest earned on cash balances in our international treasury centers 

in 2014  our effective tax rate decreased  to 328  from 340   in 2013  income taxes for 2014  and 2013  reflect the recognition of an income tax benefit of 114 million  and 65 million  respectively related to expenses incurred in connection with the proposed merger with publicis prior to the termination of the proposed merger on may 8 2014 the majority of the merger costs were capitalized for income tax purposes and the related tax benefits were not recorded because the proposed merger was terminated the merger costs were no longer required to be capitalized for income tax purposes excluding the income tax effect of the merger expenses from both years our effective tax rate for 2014  and 2013  was 332  and 336  respectively

the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes including note 2  significant accounting policies  for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our costmethod investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill 

we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in making acquisitions the valuation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation competitive position geographic coverage and services offered of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and accordingly the assets acquired including identified intangible assets the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values in circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100 of an entity is acquired we record 100 of the goodwill acquired acquisitionrelated costs including advisory legal accounting valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations earnouts contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date in 2014  we completed 10  acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in businesses in which we had an existing minority ownership interest 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach andor their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical for most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the knowhow of the workforce which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network monitor the performance and are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification or fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and the guidance set forth in fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions 

we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” 

the range of assumptions for the longterm growth rate and wacc used in our evaluations as of june 30 2014  and 2013  were 



long term growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past ten years was   56   and the average nominal   gdp growth of the countries comprising our major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was 42  over the same period we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2014  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp we also believe based on our historical performance that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth in the markets we operate in for the annual test as of june 30 2014  we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 4  for our reporting units 

when performing the annual impairment test as of june 30 2014  and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2014  in the first half of 2014  we experienced an increase in our revenue of 51  which excludes growth from acquisitions and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates economic conditions in the euro zone in 2014  were unsettled and the fiscal issues facing many countries in the european union continue to cause economic uncertainty in many of our euro zone markets we considered the effect of these conditions in the annual impairment test 

the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 

our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion 

under us gaap we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to step 1 of the goodwill impairment test although not required we performed step 1 of the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill based on the results of the impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired at june 30 2014  because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective net book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test was approximately 70 notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our wacc and longterm growth rate are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on the impairment test as of june 30 2014  revealed that if the wacc increased by 1 andor the longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and would pass step 1 of the impairment test 

we will continue to perform the impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test the estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

subsequent to the annual impairment test at june 30 2014  there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim impairment test additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 2  4  and 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition  and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services based on a rate per hour or equivalent basis revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with the client arrangement and upon the completion of the earnings process prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection must be reasonably assured these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines advertising crm public relations and specialty communications certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned although we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with thirdparty suppliers are excluded from our revenue in certain arrangements we act as principal and we contract directly with thirdparty suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are responsible for payment in these circumstances revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services 

some of our client arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize performance incentives in revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by the client 

in may 2014 the fasb issued fasb accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  or   asu 201409 which replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap asu 201409 will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early application is not permitted asu 201409 provides for one of two methods of transition retrospective application to each prior period presented or recognition of the cumulative effect of retrospective application of the new standard in the period of initial application we will apply asu 201409 on january 1 2017 however we are not yet in a position to assess the transition method we will choose or the impact of the application on our results of operations or financial position 

additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation is measured at the grant date fair value based on the fair value of the award we use the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock option awards this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined and fixed on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note 2  to the consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation expense of 935 million  863 million  and 808 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively was primarily attributed to restricted stock awards information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 10  to the consolidated financial statements

results of operations  2014  compared to 2013  in millions 



in 2014  and 2013  we incurred 88 million  and 414 million  of expenses in connection with the proposed merger with publicis which were primarily comprised of professional fees on may 8 2014 the proposed merger was terminated excluding the merger expenses operating income and operating margin for 2014  and 2013  were 19529 million  and 127  and 18667 million  and 128  respectively and ebita and ebita margin for 2014  and 2013  were 20600 million  and 134  and 19675 million  and 135  respectively excluding the income tax effect of the merger expenses of 114 million  in 2014  and 65 million  in 2013  income tax expense was 6045 million  in 2014  and 5717 million  in 2013  excluding the aftertax effect of the merger expenses net income  omnicom group inc was 11014 million  in 2014  and 10260 million  in 2013  

ebita which we define as earnings before interest taxes and amortization of intangible assets and ebita margin which we define as ebita divided by revenue are nongaap financial measures we use ebita and ebita margin as additional operating performance measures which exclude the noncash amortization expense of acquired intangible assets the table above reconciles ebita and ebita margin to the us gaap financial measure of operating income for the periods presented we believe that ebita and ebita margin are useful measures to evaluate the performance of our businesses nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

revenue 

in 2014  revenue increased   7333 million  or 50  to 153178 million  from 145845 million  in 2013  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue 1126 million  acquisitions net of dispositions increased  revenue 190 million  and organic growth increased  revenue 8269 million  

the components of 2014  revenue change in the united states “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were in millions 



the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

 

for the year ended december 31 2014  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue by 08  or 1126 million  compared to 2013  the most significant impacts resulted from the weakening of several currencies including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar japanese yen russian rouble and south african rand against the us dollar this was partially offset by the strengthening of the british pound against the us dollar 

in the fourth quarter of 2014  substantially all foreign currencies weakened against the us dollar as a result changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014  by 31  or 1294 million  our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in their local currency however for the most part revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency which minimizes the economic impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our results of operations assuming exchange rates at january 30 2015  remain unchanged we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce 2015  revenue by approximately 5  

revenue for 2014  and the percentage change in revenue and organic growth from 2013  in our principal regional markets were in millions 



europe comprises the united kingdom and various euro currency countries and other european countries that have not adopted the european union monetary standard in 2014  the percentage of revenue attributed to the uk was 98  and the percentage of revenue attributed the euro currency and other european countries was 185  in 2014  total revenue growth for the uk was 125  and total revenue growth for the euro currency and other european countries was 01

our principal discretionary cash uses include dividend payments to common shareholders capital expenditures payments for strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock in the second quarter of 2014  following the termination of the proposed merger with publicis we resumed repurchases of our common stock our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand as well as if needed other available sources of funding such as issuing commercial paper borrowing under our 25 billion  credit line or credit agreement or other longterm borrowings to finance these activities we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund both our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending through 2015 however we may access the capital markets at any time if favorable conditions exist 

we have a seasonal cash requirement normally peaking during the second quarter of the year primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations this typically results in a net borrowing requirement that decreases over the course of the year 

 our cash and cash equivalents decreased   3224 million  to 24 billion  at december 31 2014  from 27 billion  at december 31 2013  the components of the decrease for 2014  are in millions 



principal cash sources and principal cash uses amounts are nongaap financial measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our statement of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding the primary sources and primary uses of our cash flow nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

cash management 

we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia the treasury centers are managed by our whollyowned finance subsidiaries each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to access local currency uncommitted credit lines the credit agreement or issue up to a total of 2 billion  of us dollardenominated commercial paper this process enables us to manage our debt balances more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as better manage our risk to foreign exchange rate changes in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines 

as discussed in cash sources and requirements cash and cash equivalents decreased   3224 million  from december 31 2013  shortterm investments decreased   160 million  from december 31 2013  shortterm investments principally consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash within our current operating cycle generally one year 

at december 31 2014  total cash and cash equivalents were 24 billion  of which our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 14 billion  the majority of the cash is available to us net of any taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states changes in international tax rules or changes in us tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

we have policies governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each financial institution in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of the financial institutions that are party to our credit agreement these financial institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations we ensure that all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

our net debt position which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased   8689 million  at december 31 2014  as compared to december 31 2013  primarily as a result of the excess of principal cash uses in excess of principal cash sources of 4103 million  as described above in cash sources and requirements a decrease in foreign cash balances of 2739 million  resulting from the translation of local currencies to us dollars and increases to net debt related to noncash changes in the interest rate swaps and other items of 1847 million the components of net debt for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  were in millions 



net debt as reconciled above is a nongaap financial measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management performance nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

as described in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements in july 2014 we redeemed our outstanding convertible notes due 2032 for 2527 million  in cash and in june 2013 we redeemed our outstanding convertible notes due 2033 and the convertible notes due 2038 for 4067 million  in cash in october 2014 we issued 750 million  principal amount of our 2024 notes the proceeds from the issuance were 7476 million  before deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses the issuance of the 2024 notes subsequent to the redemption of the convertible notes essentially restored our financial leverage to approximate historical levels 

on may 1 2014  we entered into a fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the 125 billion  principal amount of the 2022 notes and on september 29 2014  we entered into a fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the 1 billion  principal amount of the 2020 notes the interest rate swaps hedge the risk of changes in fair value of the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes attributable to changes in the benchmark libor interest rate under the swap agreements we receive fixed interest rate payments equal to the coupon interest rate on the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes and pay a variable interest rate on the total principal amount of the notes equal to three month libor in arrears plus a spread of 105  on the 2022 notes and a spread of 216  on the 2020 notes the swaps qualify and are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes the swaps have the economic effect of converting the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt gains and losses attributed to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes attributed to changes in the benchmark interest rate 

debt instruments and related covenants 

we have committed and uncommitted credit lines on july 31 2014 we amended the credit agreement to extend the term to july 31 2019  we have the ability to classify borrowings under the credit agreement as longterm in addition we can issue up to 2 billion  of commercial paper 

we typically fund our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper also we may borrow under our uncommitted credit lines or credit agreement to fund our daytoday liquidity at december 31 2014  there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit agreement 

commercial paper activity for the three years ended december 31 2014  was dollars in millions 



at december 31 2014  shortterm borrowings of 72 million  represent bank overdrafts and credit lines of our international subsidiaries these bank overdrafts and credit lines are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the agreements supporting the facilities 

the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda to no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12month period under the credit agreement ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12month period at december 31 2014 we were in compliance with these covenants as our leverage ratio was 20 times and our interest coverage ratio was 126 times  the credit agreement does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 

sp rates our longterm debt bbb and moody’s rates our longterm debt baa1 our shortterm debt credit ratings are a2 and p2 by the respective rating agencies our outstanding senior notes and credit agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event our debt credit ratings are downgraded 

omnicom capital inc or oci our whollyowned finance subsidiary together with us is a coobligor under all the senior notes the senior notes are a joint and several liability of us and oci and we unconditionally guarantee oci’s obligations with respect to the senior notes oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci’s assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of oci or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

at december 31 2014  the carrying value of our debt and the amount available under the credit agreement were in millions 



credit markets and availability of credit 

we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and actively manage our discretionary expenditures and we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients we believe that these actions in addition to operating cash flow and the availability of our credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs and our discretionary spending through 2015 

in funding our daytoday liquidity we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market we expect to continue funding our daytoday liquidity through the commercial paper market however disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads to mitigate any future disruption in the credit markets and to fund our daytoday liquidity we may use our uncommitted credit lines or borrow under our credit agreement we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

in the normal course of our business we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations at december 31 2014  were in millions 

commercial commitments at december 31 2014  were in millions 



consistent with our acquisition strategy and past practice certain of our acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations 

the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and liability for our postemployment arrangements was  2704 million  at december 31 2014  in 2014  we contributed 32 million  to our defined benefit pension plans and paid  92 million  in benefits for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2015  

the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 

in the normal course of our business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition methods of managing the risk of payment defaults including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a global business we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets our regional treasury centers use derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts as an economic hedge to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we use derivative financial instruments such as fixedtofloating interest rate swaps to manage the cost of debt more efficiently 

as a result of using derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a valueatrisk or var analysis var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 95 confidence a maximum oneday change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2014  was not significant 

foreign exchange risk 

our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in their local currency the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 19  of the consolidated financial statements for the most part revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency which minimizes the economic impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations 

while our major nonus currency markets are the european monetary union the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies conduct business in more than 50 different currencies as an integral part of our treasury operations we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds in certain circumstances instead of using a multicurrency pool operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions we use forward foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2014  we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 1131 million  mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany borrowing and investment activities also we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts at december 31 2014  we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 440 million  mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these activities we designate foreign currency derivative instruments as an economic hedge therefore any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures by using these financial instruments we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to interest rate risk has been limited because our senior notes are fixed rate debt in 2014 to manage our annual interest cost more efficiently by benefiting from a decline in interest rates we used fixedtofloating interest rate swaps to convert specific fixed rate debt into variable rate debt in 2014 we entered into fixedtofloating interest rate swaps on the 125 billion  principal amount of the 2022 notes and the 1 billion  principal amount of the 2020 notes under the swap agreements we receive fixed interest rate payments equal to the coupon interest rate on the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes and we pay a variable interest rate on the total principal amount of the notes equal to three month libor in arrears plus a spread of 105  on the 2022 notes and a spread of 216  on the 2020 notes the swaps have the economic effect of converting the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt and effectively convert our longterm debt portfolio to 50 fixed rate debt and 50 floating rate debt at december 31 2014  we recorded a receivable which is included in other assets of 427 million  representing the fair value of the swaps that was substantially offset by the increase in the carrying value of the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes reflecting the change in fair value of the notes 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 26  of revenue in 2014  and no other client accounted for more than 25  of revenue however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of our business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition methods of managing the risk of payment defaults including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn

 item 1 business 

pending business combination 

on july 27 2013  the company and publicis groupe sa “publicis” entered into a business combination agreement the “business combination agreement” pursuant to which the company and publicis agreed subject to the terms and conditions of the business combination agreement to combine their respective businesses the “business combination” in the business combination publicis will merge the “publicis merger” with and into publicis omnicom group nv a newlyformed dutch holding company “publicis omnicom group” or “holdco” with publicis omnicom group being the surviving entity in the publicis merger and immediately after consummation of the publicis merger a corporation whollyowned by publicis omnicom group will merge the “omnicom merger” and together with the publicis merger the “mergers” with and into the company with the company being the surviving corporation in the omnicom merger 

in the publicis merger each issued and outstanding share of publicis will be exchanged for 1000000  ordinary share of publicis omnicom group in addition prior to completion of the publicis merger publicis intends to declare and pay a special dividend in cash in an amount equal to €100  per publicis share the “publicis transaction dividend” in the omnicom merger each share of common stock of the company will be converted into the right to receive 0813008  of a publicis omnicom group ordinary share together with cash in lieu of fractional shares subject to adjustment to account for certain changes in outstanding shares and certain excluded asset values as set forth in the business combination agreement similarly prior to completion of the omnicom merger the company intends to declare and pay a special cash dividend of 200  per share of the company’s outstanding common stock the “omnicom transaction dividend” and together with the publicis transaction dividend the “transaction dividends” subject to adjustment to account for certain changes in outstanding shares of the parties and certain excluded asset values in each case as set forth in the business combination agreement and if necessary to equalize the cumulative amount of regular dividends paid by the company after july 27 2013 with the cumulative amount of regular publicis dividends paid after july 27 2013 however dividends of up to 080  per share in the aggregate paid to holders of the companys common stock in respect of record dates after july 27 2013 and before the mergers are not included in this equalization the payment of the transaction dividends is also subject to applicable law 

completion of the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement which include the mergers the publicis transaction dividend and the omnicom transaction dividend collectively the “transactions” will require resolution of all open issues complexities and challenges and will be subject to the satisfaction or waiver if legally permitted of certain conditions including a approval and adoption of the business combination agreement and the omnicom merger by the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company approval of the crossborder merger terms as described in the business combination agreement and the publicis merger by the holders of twothirds of the voting rights attached to the publicis shares present at a meeting of the publicis shareholders and the approval of the publicis transaction dividend by the holders of a majority of the voting rights attached to the publicis shares present at a meeting of the publicis shareholders b approval by requisite governmental regulators and authorities including approvals under applicable competition laws c the listing of the publicis omnicom group ordinary shares on applicable stock exchanges d the absence of any law or order prohibiting the completion of the transactions and e the absence of a material adverse effect on either the company or publicis therefore completion of the transactions is unlikely to occur before the third quarter of 2014 

the completion of the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement will have a material effect on our future results of operations and financial position 

our business 

omnicom a strategic holding company was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we are a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company and we operate in a highly competitive industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and mediums has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn 

 1 

to marketing service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures 

our agencies operate in all major markets around the world and provide a comprehensive range of services which we group into four fundamental disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and specialty communications the services included in these disciplines are 



although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific consulting services 

our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to deliver our services and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model demands that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it differentiates us from our competitors 

our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines and geographies this means that the delivery of our services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously further we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for advertising and marketing communications services our overarching business strategy is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients 

the various components of our business and material factors that affected us in 2013  are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or mda of this report none of our acquisitions or dispositions in the three year period ended december 31 2013  was material to our financial position or results of operations for information concerning our acquisitions see note 5  to our consolidated financial statements 

geographic regions and segments 

our revenue is almost evenly divided between our united states and international operations for financial information concerning our domestic and international operations and segment reporting see our mda and note 8  to our consolidated financial statements 

our clients 

consistent with our fundamental business strategy our agencies serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients across a variety of geographic regions and locations our clients operate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy furthermore in many cases multiple agencies or networks serve different brand andor product groups within the same clients for example in 2013  our largest client was served by more than 175 of our agencies and represented 27  of revenue and no other client accounted for more than 25  of revenue in 2013  our top 100 clients ranked 

by revenue were each served on average by more than 50 of our agencies and collectively represented approximately 51  of revenue 

our employees 

at december 31 2013  we employed approximately 71800  people we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our client service professionals around this competency see our mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations 

executive officers of the registrant 

at january 31 2014  our executive officers were 



each executive officer has held his present position for at least five years 

additional information about our directors and executive officers will appear under the captions “corporate governance” “transactions with related persons” “election of directors” “executive compensation” “directors compensation for fiscal 2013” and “stock ownership” in our definitive proxy statement which is expected to be filed with the sec by april 10 2014  




 item 1a risk factors 

our entry into the business combination agreement with publicis may have adverse impacts 

in order to complete the business combination with publicis customary closing conditions must be satisfied including receipt of approvals by governmental regulators and authorities including approvals under applicable competition laws approval by our and publicis shareholders of the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement the listing of the publicis omnicom group shares on the applicable stock exchanges and the absence of a material adverse effect on either our business or the publicis business it is not certain that these conditions will be met or waived that we and publicis will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or that we will be able to resolve all open issues complexities and challenges necessary to consummate successfully the business combination as provided for under the business combination agreement or at all 

we face risks and uncertainties due both to the pendency of the business combination as well as the potential failure to consummate the business combination including 

 the occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our share price business and cash flows results of operations and financial position 

global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position 

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance in particular current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services if domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions reductions in our client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

a reduction in client spending a delay in client payments or conditions in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

global economic uncertainty turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses including us to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors including us and could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital we could need to obtain additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements in such circumstances there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms if at all such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

in an economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 

companies periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

the markets we operate in are highly competitive and are expected to remain so key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships the retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel including highly skilled technically proficient personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

approximately 51  of our revenue in 2013  came from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns or they could reduce future spending a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we rely extensively on information technology systems 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions summarize results and manage our business including maintaining client marketing and advertising information our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public additionally we utilize third parties including cloud providers to store transfer or process data while we have taken what we believe are prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems or in systems of third parties we use that could adversely affect our reputation or business 

government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

additionally government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

further laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position and liquidity 

we face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions competition for client assignments and talented staff new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 which can be complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position for financial information on our operations by geographic region see note 8  to our consolidated financial statements 

we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries and highgrowth markets 

we conduct business in numerous developing countries and highgrowth markets around the world our operations outside the united states are also exposed to risks that include slower receipt of payments social political and economic instability currency fluctuation and currency repatriation restrictions in addition commercial laws in developing countries and highgrowth markets can be undeveloped vague inconsistently enforced or frequently changed if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in countries and markets where we conduct business our prospects and business in those countries and markets could be harmed which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 

standard and poor’s rating service or sp rates our longterm debt bbb  and moody’s investors service or moodys rates our longterm debt baa1  our shortterm debt ratings are a2  and p2  by the respective rating agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes due july 31 2032 or the 2032  notes and 25 billion credit agreement or the credit agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade however the interest rates and fees on our credit agreement would increase if our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded also our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our shortterm or longterm debt credit ratings our 2032  notes would become convertible into shares of our common stock if the credit ratings assigned to the 2032 notes are downgraded to bbb or lower by sp or baa3 or lower by moody’s 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the evaluation we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill may become impaired which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities which principally represents the specialized knowhow of the workforce at the acquired businesses as discussed in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting impairment charge although noncash could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

generally our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise although our businesses could be in the future however we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers further if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements either directly or indirectly their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs at this time we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position

 item 3 legal proceedings 

a putative class action challenging the business combination was filed on august 5 2013 on behalf of omnicom shareholders in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county the action entitled ansfield v wren et al names as defendants omnicom and its board of directors as well as publicis and holdco it alleges that the members of the omnicom board breached their fiduciary duties by among other things approving a merger that is purportedly detrimental to omnicom’s shareholders the action also alleges that publicis aided and abetted the omnicom board’s breach of their fiduciary duties the action seeks an injunction barring or rescinding the business combination damages and attorneys’ fees and costs 

two additional purported class actions were subsequently filed in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county lee v omnicom group et al filed on august 14 2013 and fultz v crawford et al filed on august 20 2013 both of these actions name as defendants omnicom and its board of directors as well as publicis and make substantially the same allegations and seek substantially the same relief as the ansfield case 

on august 19 2013 plaintiffs in the ansfield and lee actions filed a motion to consolidate those actions with each other and with all subsequently filed or transferred actions arising out of the same facts and circumstances to select plaintiffs as lead plaintiffs and to approve plaintiffs’ selection of counsel as colead counsel on october 3 2013 plaintiffs in all three cases asked the court to consolidate the three cases and to approve lead plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ selection of counsel as colead counsel 

on october 24 2013 the court approved plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate the ansfield lee and fultz actions with each other and with all subsequently filed or transferred actions arising out of the same facts and circumstances under the caption in re omnicom group inc shareholder litigation  index no 6527372013 and in the same order appointed colead counsel on october 29 2013 the court approved the parties’ stipulation requiring plaintiffs to file an amended complaint within three weeks after holdco files a preliminary proxy statementprospectus 

omnicom believes the consolidated lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend vigorously against it due to the inherent uncertainties of such matters and because discovery is not yet completed we are unable to predict potential outcomes or estimate of the range of potential damages if any management does not presently expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in various other legal proceedings we do not presently expect that these other proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

pending business combination 

on july 27 2013  the company and publicis groupe sa “publicis” entered into a business combination agreement the “business combination agreement” pursuant to which the company and publicis agreed subject to the terms and conditions of the business combination agreement to combine their respective businesses the “business combination” in the business combination publicis will merge the “publicis merger” with and into publicis omnicom group nv a newlyformed dutch holding company “publicis omnicom group” or “holdco” with publicis omnicom group being the surviving entity in the publicis merger and immediately after consummation of the publicis merger a corporation whollyowned by publicis omnicom group will merge the “omnicom merger” and together with the publicis merger the “mergers” with and into the company with the company being the surviving corporation in the omnicom merger 

in the publicis merger each issued and outstanding share of publicis will be exchanged for 1000000  ordinary share of publicis omnicom group in addition prior to completion of the publicis merger publicis intends to declare and pay a special dividend in cash in an amount equal to €100  per publicis share the “publicis transaction dividend” in the omnicom merger each share of common stock of the company will be converted into the right to receive 0813008  of a publicis omnicom group ordinary share together with cash in lieu of fractional shares subject to adjustment to account for certain changes in outstanding shares and certain excluded asset values as set forth in the business combination agreement similarly prior to completion of the omnicom merger the company intends to declare and pay a special cash dividend of 200  per share of the company’s outstanding common stock the “omnicom transaction dividend” and together with the publicis transaction dividend the “transaction dividends” subject to adjustment to account for certain changes in outstanding shares of the parties and certain excluded asset values in each case as set forth in the business combination agreement and if necessary to equalize the cumulative amount of regular dividends paid by the company after july 27 2013 with the cumulative amount of regular publicis dividends paid after july 27 2013 however dividends of up to 080  per share in the aggregate paid to holders of the company’s common stock in respect of record dates after july 27 2013 and before the mergers are not included in this equalization the payment of the transaction dividends is also subject to applicable law 

completion of the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement which include the mergers the publicis transaction dividend and the omnicom transaction dividend collectively the “transactions” will require resolution of all open issues complexities and challenges and will be subject to the satisfaction or waiver if legally permitted of certain conditions including a approval and adoption of the business combination agreement and the omnicom merger by the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company approval of the crossborder merger terms as described in the business combination agreement and the publicis merger by the holders of twothirds of the voting rights attached to the publicis shares present at a meeting of the publicis shareholders and the approval of the publicis transaction dividend by the holders of a majority of the voting rights attached to the publicis shares present at a meeting of the publicis shareholders b approval by requisite governmental regulators and authorities including approvals under applicable competition laws c the listing of the publicis omnicom group ordinary shares on applicable stock exchanges d the absence of any law or order prohibiting the completion of the transactions and e the absence of a material adverse effect on either the company or publicis therefore completion of the transactions is unlikely to occur before the third quarter of 2014 

the completion of the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement will have a material effect on our future results of operations and financial position 

executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our clients’ specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets around the world and have a large and diverse client base in 2013  our largest client accounted for 27  of revenue and no other client accounted for more than 25  of revenue our top 100 clients accounted for approximately 51  of revenue in 2013  our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 14  of revenue in 2013  although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

as described in more detail below in 2013  revenue increased   26  compared to 2012  increased revenue in the united states and continued growth in both highgrowth markets and emerging markets of asia and latin america was partially offset by the ongoing economic weakness in the euro zone 

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance in particular current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services in 2013  the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand while economic conditions in the euro zone began to stabilize in the second half of 2013 the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the european union has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions reductions in our client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets clients continue to require greater coordination of marketing activities we believe these trends have benefited our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 

in the near term barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and the effect of the pending merger with publicis as a result of continued improvement in operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our 2014  revenue to increase modestly in excess of the weighted average nominal gdp growth in our major markets we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities intended to build upon the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we review focus on revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by major geographic region growth by major marketing discipline impact from foreign currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients in recent years our revenue has been divided almost evenly between our domestic and international operations 

in 2013  revenue increased   26  compared to 2012  organic growth increased  revenue 35  acquisitions net of dispositions reduced  revenue 03  and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced  revenue by 06  across our geographic markets revenue increased   28  in the united states 62  in the united kingdom 18  in our other markets primarily asia and latin america and 09  in our euro markets the change in revenue in 2013  compared to 2012  in our four fundamental disciplines was advertising increased   36  crm increased   13  public relations increased   29  and specialty communications increased   20  

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs consist of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs office and general expenses consist of rent and occupancy costs technology costs depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses each of our agencies requires professionals with the skill sets that are common across our disciplines at the core of the skill sets is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are also similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software because we are a service business we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs in relation to revenue 

salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue salary and service costs increased   31  in 2013  compared to 2012  reflecting growth in revenue and an increase  in employee compensation including incentive compensation and severance as well as increases  related to changes in the mix of our business during the year 

office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs office and general expenses decreased   07  in 2013  compared to 2012  reflecting our continuing efforts to control the cost structures of our agencies 

in the second half of 2013  we incurred 414 million  of expenses in connection with the pending merger with publicis which are primarily comprised of professional fees the merger expenses are shown as a separate component of operating expenses and we expect to incur additional merger expenses in 2014  

operating margins decreased  to 125  in 2013  from 127  in 2012  and ebita margins decreased  to 132  in 2013  from 134  in 2012  excluding the merger expenses of 414 million  operating margins for 2013   increased  to 128   from 127  in 2012  and ebita margins for 2013   increased  to 135  from 134  in 2012  

net interest expense increased   to   1644 million   in   2013   from   1446 million   in   2012  interest expense increased   175 million   to   1972 million  the increase  in interest expense in 2013  is primarily attributable to the issuance of our 3625 senior notes due may 1 2022 or the 2022 notes of which 750 million were issued in april 2012 and 500 million were issued in august 2012 interest income decreased   23 million  to 328 million  in 2013  

our effective tax rate increased  to 340  in 2013  from 318   in 2012  excluding the income tax effect of the merger expenses of 65 million  which reflects the estimated impact of the nondeductibility of a significant portion of the merger expenses our effective tax rate for 2013  was 336  which is consistent with our expected effective tax rate for 2013  and reflects the full year effect of the reduction in income tax expense resulting from the implementation of the legal reorganization in the asia pacific region which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 

net income  omnicom group inc decreased   72 million  or 07  to 9911 million  in 2013  from 9983 million  in 2012  the yearoveryear decrease  in net income  omnicom group inc is due to the factors described above diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc increased   28  to 371  in 2013  compared to 361  in 2012  due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding was the result of repurchases of our common stock net of stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan and shares issued upon conversion of our convertible notes due june 15 2033 or 2033 notes and our convertible notes due july 1 2038 or 2038 notes in connection with the pending merger with publicis beginning in the third quarter of 2013 we suspended repurchases of our common stock in the open market excluding the net effect of the merger expenses net income  omnicom group inc for 2013  was 10260 million  and diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc was 384

critical accounting policies 

the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes including note 3  significant accounting policies  for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our costmethod investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill 

we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in making acquisitions the valuation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation competitive position geographic coverage and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and accordingly the assets acquired including identified intangible assets the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values in circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100 of an entity is acquired we record 100 of the goodwill acquired acquisitionrelated costs including advisory legal accounting valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations earnouts contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as liabilities at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liabilities are recorded in our results of operations the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date in 2013  we completed 8  acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in businesses in which we had an existing minority ownership interest goodwill increased 699 million  in 2013  which included contingent purchase price payments earnouts for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 of 145 million  contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 are accrued in accordance with us gaap when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach andor their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the knowhow of the people which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and the guidance set forth in fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions 

we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” 

the range of assumptions for the longterm growth rate and wacc used in our evaluations as of june 30 2013  and 2012  were 



long term growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past ten years was approximately   68   and the average nominal   gdp growth of the countries comprising our major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was 43  over the same period we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2013  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp we also believe based on our historical performance that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth in the markets we operate in for our annual test as of june 30 2013  we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 4  for our reporting units 

when performing our annual impairment test as of june 30 2013  and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2013  in the first half of 2013  we experienced an increase in our revenue of 28  which excludes growth from acquisitions and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates while economic conditions in the euro zone began to stabilize in the second half of 2013 the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the european union has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets we considered the effect of these conditions in our annual impairment test 

the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 

our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion 

under us gaap we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to step 1 of the goodwill impairment test although not required we performed step 1 of the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill based on the results of our impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired at june 30 2013  because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective net book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test was approximately 70 notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our wacc and longterm growth rate are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june 30 2013  revealed that if wacc increased by 1 andor longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and would pass step 1 of the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test the estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step 1 of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

subsequent to our annual impairment test at june 30 2013  there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim impairment test additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 3  5  and 6  to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition  and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services based on a rate per hour or equivalent basis revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with the client arrangement and upon the completion of the earnings process prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection must be reasonably assured these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines advertising crm public relations and specialty communications certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned although we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with thirdparty suppliers are excluded from our revenue in certain arrangements we act as principal and we contract directly with thirdparty suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are responsible for payment in these circumstances revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services 

some of our client arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize performance incentives in revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients 

additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation is measured at the grant date fair value based on the fair value of the award we use the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock option awards this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation expense was 863 million  808 million  and 745 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 10  to our consolidated financial statements

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2012   decreased  to 318  from 327  for 2011  in the fourth quarter of 2012 income tax expense was reduced by 53 million primarily resulting from a reduction in the deferred tax liabilities for unremitted foreign earnings of certain of our operating companies located in the asia pacific region as well as lower statutory tax rates in other foreign jurisdictions in an effort to support our continued expansion and pu r sue operational efficiencies in the asia pacific region we completed a legal reorganization in certain countries within the region as a result of the reorganization our unremitted foreign earnings in the affected countries are subject to lower effective tax rates as compared to the us statutory tax rate therefore we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower tax rate that these earnings are subject to in future periods we expect an ongoing annual reduction in income tax expense of approximately 11 million the reduction in income tax expense was partially offset by a charge of approximately 16 million resulting from us state and local tax accruals recorded for uncertain tax positions net of us federal income tax benefit

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements 

historically the majority of our nondiscretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes and 2032 notes our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations as well as contingent purchase price obligations earnouts for acquisitions made in prior years 

our principal discretionary cash uses include dividend payments capital expenditures payments for strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock in connection with the pending merger with publicis beginning in the third quarter of 2013 we suspended repurchases of our common stock in the open market our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand in addition depending on the level of our discretionary activity and conditions in the capital markets we may use other available sources of funding such as issuing commercial paper borrowing under our credit agreement or other longterm borrowings to finance these activities we expect that we should be able to fund both our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending for 2014  without incurring additional longterm debt however we may access the capital markets at any time if favorable conditions exist 

we have a seasonal cash requirement normally peaking during the second quarter primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations this typically results in a net borrowing requirement that decreases over the course of the year 

at december 31 2013  our cash and cash equivalents increased  by 322 million  from december 31 2012  the components of the increase for 2013  are in millions

cash management 

we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia the treasury centers are managed by our whollyowned finance subsidiaries each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to access local currency uncommitted lines of credit the credit agreement or issue up to a total of 15 billion  of us dollardenominated commercial paper this process enables us to manage our debt balances more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as better manage our risk to foreign exchange rate changes in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted lines of credit 

our cash and cash equivalents increased   322 million  and our shortterm investments decreased   24 million  from december 31 2012  shortterm investments principally consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash within our current operating cycle generally one year 

at december 31 2013  our total cash and cash equivalents were 27 billion  of which our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 23 billion  the majority of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries is available to us net of any taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states changes in international tax rules or changes in us tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

we have policies governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we have deposit limits for each financial institution in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of the financial institutions that are party to our credit agreement these financial institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations we ensure that all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased   298 million  from the prior year end our net debt position at december 31 2013  which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased   4454 million  as compared to december 31 2012  as follows in millions 



net debt which we define as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as reconciled above is a nongaap financial measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management performance nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

on may 16 2013 we called our 2033 notes and our 2038 notes for redemption on june 17 2013 at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount as provided in the indenture governing the 2033 notes and the 2038 notes prior to redemption the noteholders had the right to convert their 2033 notes and 2038 notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 194174 shares per 1000 principal amount at any time prior to june 13 2013 substantially all the noteholders exercised their conversion right we paid 4061 million in cash representing the principal amount of the 2033 notes and 2038 notes that were converted and issued 1499792 shares of our common stock to satisfy the conversion premium on june 17 2013 we paid 06 million to redeem the remaining 2033 notes and 2038 notes that were not converted 

debt instruments and related covenants 

we have committed and uncommitted lines of credit our 25 billion  credit agreement expires on october 12 2016  we have the ability to classify borrowings under the credit agreement as longterm the credit agreement provides support for up to 15 billion  of commercial paper issuances and such issuances reduce the amount available under the credit agreement 

depending on market conditions at the time we typically fund our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper borrowing under our uncommitted lines of credit or borrowing under our credit agreement at december 31 2013  there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit agreement 

commercial paper activity for the three years ended december 31 2013  was dollars in millions 



at december 31 2013  shortterm borrowings of 59 million  represent bank overdrafts and lines of credit of our international subsidiaries these bank overdrafts and lines of credit are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the agreements supporting the facilities 

the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda to no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12month period under the credit agreement ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12month period at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with these covenants as our leverage ratio was 19 times and our interest coverage ratio was 107 times  the credit agreement does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends 

sp rates our longterm debt bbb and moody’s rates our longterm debt baa1 our shortterm debt credit ratings are a2 and p2 by the respective rating agencies our outstanding senior notes 2032 notes and credit agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded however the interest rates and fees on the credit agreement will increase if our longterm debt credit ratings are lowered our 2032  notes would become convertible into shares of our common stock if the credit ratings assigned to the 2032 notes are downgraded to bbb or lower by sp or baa3 or lower by moody’s 

omnicom capital inc or oci our whollyowned finance subsidiary together with us is a coobligor under our senior notes and our 2032 notes our senior notes and 2032 notes are a joint and several liability of us and oci and we unconditionally guarantee oci’s obligations with respect to the senior notes and the 2032 notes oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci’s assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of oci or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances our senior notes and 2032 notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

at december 31 2013  the carrying value of our debt and the amount available under the credit agreement were in millions 



credit markets and availability of credit 

we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and actively manage our discretionary expenditures and we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients we believe that these actions in addition to operating cash flow and the availability of our credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs and our discretionary spending 

in funding our daytoday liquidity we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market we expect to continue funding our daytoday liquidity through the commercial paper market however prior disruptions in the credit markets led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads during these periods of disruption we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit agreement to mitigate these conditions and to fund our daytoday liquidity we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of business the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations at december 31 2013  were in millions 

contractual commitments at december 31 2013  were in millions 



on july 31 2014  our 2032 notes may be put back to us for cash and we have the right to redeem the 2032 notes at any time on or after july 31 2014  at december 31 2013  the 2032 notes are potentially convertible into 18313 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount subject to normal antidilution adjustments if the put right is exercised 2527 million  could be due in 2014  at december 31 2013  we classified our 2032 notes as longterm in our balance sheet because our credit agreement does not expire until october 2016  and it is our intention to fund any repurchase with the credit agreement 

consistent with our acquisition strategy and past practice certain of our acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts we use contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired business during the postacquisition transition period contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as liabilities at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations 

the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and liability for our postemployment arrangements was  2177 million  at december 31 2013  in 2013  we contributed 55 million  to our defined benefit pension plans and paid  134 million  in benefits for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2014  

the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a global service business we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of interest rate changes we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives for foreign currency exposure derivatives are used as an economic hedge to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations for interest rate exposure derivatives have been used to manage the related cost of debt 

as a result of using derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a valueatrisk or var analysis var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value on our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2013  was not material 

because we use foreign currency instruments as an economic hedge any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

foreign exchange risk 

our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in their local currency the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 19  of our consolidated financial statements for the most part revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency this minimizes the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations 

while our major nonus currency markets are the european monetary union or the emu the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies conduct business in more than 50 different currencies as an integral part of our treasury operations we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds 

in certain circumstances instead of using a multicurrency pool operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions we use forward foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2013  we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2070 million  mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany borrowing and investment activities 

also we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts at december 31 2013  we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 562 million  mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these activities 

by using these financial instruments we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 

interest rate risk 

from time to time we have issued debt in the capital markets in prior years we have used interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest cost at december 31 2013  there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 

on july 31 2014  our 2032 notes may be put back to us for cash and we have the right to redeem the notes at any time on or after july 31 2014  if the 2032 notes are put back to us our interest expense will change the extent if any of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that is refinanced when we refinance the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 27  of revenue in 2013  and no other client accounted for more than 25  of revenue however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies if permitted by local law and the client agreement many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal in addition while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services 

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

in addition methods of managing the risk of payment default including obtaining credit insurance requiring payment in advance mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn

business 

tableend our business  omnicom a strategic holding company was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we are a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in a highly competitive industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and mediums has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures 

our agencies operate in all major markets around the world and provide a comprehensive range of services which we group into four fundamental disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and specialty communications the services included in these disciplines are 



although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific consulting services 

our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to deliver our services and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model demands that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it differentiates us from our competitors 

our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines and geographies this means that the delivery of our services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously further we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for advertising and marketing communications services our overarching business strategy is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients 

the various components of our business and material factors that affected us in 2012  are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or mda of this report none of our acquisitions or dispositions in the three year period ended december 31 2012  was material to our financial position or results of operations for information concerning our acquisitions see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

geographic regions and segments  our revenue is almost evenly divided between our united states and international operations for financial information concerning our domestic and international operations and segment reporting see our mda and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

our clients  consistent with our fundamental business strategy our agencies serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients across a variety of geographic regions and locations our clients operate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy furthermore in many cases our agencies or networks serve different brand andor product groups within the same clients served by our other agencies or networks for example in 2012  our largest client was served by more than 150 of our agencies and represented 26  of our 2012  revenue no other client accounted for more than 26  of our 2012  revenue our top 100 clients ranked by revenue were each served on average by more than 50 of our agencies in 2012  and collectively represented approximately 52 of our 2012  revenue 

our employees  at december 31 2012  we employed approximately 71100  people we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline is similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our client service professionals around this competency see our mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position 

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance in particular current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services in 2012 the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand however the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the euro zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets if economic conditions in these markets do not improve the demand for our services could be further reduced if domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions reductions in our client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

in a period of severe economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase 

in the normal course of business we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and in many cases obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance further in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers in addition our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client however the agreements entered into as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

a reduction in client spending or a delay in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital consequently we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms if at all such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

companies periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

the markets we operate in are highly competitive key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel including highly skilled technically proficient personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

approximately 52 of our 2012 revenue came from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact our results of operations and financial position 

our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns or they could reduce future spending a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we rely extensively on information technology systems 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions summarize results and manage our business including maintaining client marketing and advertising information our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public additionally we utilize third parties including cloud providers to store transfer or process data while we have taken prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems or in systems of third parties we use that could adversely affect our reputation or business 

government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies as advertising mediums these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad including political instability and foreign exchange controls which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions competition for client assignments and talented staff new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations the risks of doing business abroad including political instability and foreign exchange controls do not affect domesticfocused firms these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position for financial information on our operations by geographic region see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 

we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include slower payment of invoices social political and economic instability and foreign exchange controls in addition commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague inconsistently administered and frequently changed if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors including us if that were to occur we may require additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms if at all such circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase approximately 660 million of notes in whole or in part on specific dates in the future 

on june 15 2013  4066 million  of our convertible notes due july 1 2038  or the 2038 notes  may be put back to us for repurchase and on july 31 2013  2527 million  of our convertible notes due july 31 2032  or the 2032 notes  may be put back to us for repurchase if our convertible notes are put back to us we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the repurchases we also believe that we will have sufficient capacity under our 25 billion  credit agreement or the credit agreement to meet our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any repurchase however in the event that availability under our credit agreement or our cash flow from operations were to decrease we may need to seek additional funding there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms if at all 

downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 

standard and poor’s rating service or sp rates our longterm debt bbb  and moody’s investors service or moodys rates our longterm debt baa1  our shortterm debt ratings are a2  and p2  by the respective rating agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and credit agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade however the interest rates and fees on our credit agreement would increase if our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded additionally our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our shortterm or longterm debt credit ratings furthermore the 2032  notes and 2038  notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at specified ratios if in the case of the 2032  notes our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by sp or baa3 or lower by moody’s or in the case of the 2038  notes to bbb or lower by sp and ba1 or lower by moody’s these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the evaluation we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our goodwill may become impaired which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial position 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities which principally represents the specialized knowhow of the workforce at the acquired businesses as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting impairment charge although noncash could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

generally our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other requirements to reduce emissions but our businesses could be in the future however we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs at this time we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our clients’ specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets around the world we have a large and diverse client base our largest client accounted for 26  of our 2012  revenue and no other client accounted for more than 26  of our 2012  revenue our top 100 clients accounted for approximately 52 of our 2012  revenue our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 14  of our 2012  revenue although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

in 2012  our revenue increased 25  compared to 2011  the increase reflects strong operating performance by many of our agencies partially offset by the negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates increased revenue in the united states and continued growth in the emerging markets of asia and latin america was partially offset by the ongoing economic weakness in the euro zone 

global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance in particular current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services in 2012  the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand however the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the euro zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets if economic conditions in these markets do not improve the demand for our services could be further reduced if domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions client revenue levels and other factors and in response to reductions in our client revenue if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions reductions in our client revenue changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers we believe these trends have benefited our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 

in the near term barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange as a result of continued strong operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our 2013  revenue to increase modestly in excess of the weighted average nominal gdp growth in our major markets we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities that will build on the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today 

effective february 1 2011 we acquired a controlling interest in the clemenger group our affiliate in australia and new zealand increasing our equity ownership to 737 from 467 in connection with this transaction we recorded a noncash gain of 1234 million in the first quarter of 2011 resulting from the remeasurement of the carrying value of our equity interest to the acquisition date fair value this acquisition has and will continue to help us to further develop our combined businesses throughout the asia pacific region and further enhance our global capabilities 

we had an objective of improving ebita margins to 2007 levels for the full year 2012 in connection with this objective during 2011 we reviewed our businesses with a focus on enhancing our strategic position improving our operations and 

rebalancing our workforce as part of this process we disposed of certain noncore and underperforming businesses and repositioned others as a result of these actions we incurred charges of 1313 million in the first quarter of 2011 for severance real estate lease terminations and asset and goodwill writeoffs related to disposals and other costs we continue to perform reviews of our businesses and we will take actions where appropriate to reposition underperforming businesses we will also continue to pursue operational consolidations to further drive efficiencies in our back office functions 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we review focus on revenue and operating expenses we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by major geographic region growth by major marketing discipline impact from foreign currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients in recent years our revenue has been divided almost evenly between our domestic and international operations 

revenue in 2012  increased 25  compared to 2011  of which 40  was organic growth and 07  was related to acquisitions net of dispositions changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 22  across our geographic markets revenue increased 45  in the united states 23  in the united kingdom and 90  in our other markets primarily asia and latin america while revenue decreased 104  in our euro markets the change in revenue in 2012  compared to 2011  in our four fundamental disciplines was advertising increased 46  crm increased 02  public relations increased 49  and specialty communications decreased 21  

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs consist of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs office and general expenses consist of rent and occupancy costs technology costs depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses each of our agencies requires professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are also similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software because we are a service business we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs in relation to revenue 

salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue salary and service costs increased 13  in 2012  compared to 2011  salary and service costs for 2011  reflect 928 million  of severance charges associated with our repositioning actions the increase in 2012  costs resulted from growth in our business as well as increased use of freelance labor partially offset by lower compensation costs including incentive compensation primarily as a result of the repositioning actions taken in 2011  and tight controls restricting the frequency of salary increases excluding the 928 million  of severance charges taken in 2011 salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue in 2012  would have been flat as compared to 2011  

office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs office and general expenses increased 43  in 2012  compared to 2011  office and general expenses for 2011  includes a reduction of 849 million which reflects the 1234 million noncash remeasurement gain recorded in connection with the acquisition of the controlling interest in the clemenger group and charges of 385 million related to our repositioning actions excluding the 849 million  net decrease office and general expenses in 2012  would have been flat as compared to 2011  

operating margins increased  to 127  in 2012  from 120  in 2011  and ebita margins increased  to 134  in 2012  from 127  in 2011  the yearoveryear margin improvement was driven by our revenue growth as well as lower operating costs resulting from actions taken in 2011  to improve our operations rebalance our workforce and drive efficiencies in our back office functions 

our effective tax rate for 2012    decreased  to 318  compared to 327  for 2011  in the fourth quarter of 2012 income tax expense was reduced by 53 million primarily resulting from a reduction in the deferred tax liabilities for unremitted foreign earnings of certain of our operating companies located in the asia pacific region as well as lower statutory tax rates in other foreign jurisdictions in an effort to support our continued expansion and pu r sue operational efficiencies in the asia pacific region we completed a legal reorganization in certain countries within the region as a result of the reorganization our unremitted foreign earnings in the affected countries are subject to lower effective tax rates as compared to the us statutory tax rate therefore we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower tax rate that these earnings are subject to in future periods we expect an ongoing annual reduction in income tax expense of approximately 11 million the reduction in income tax expense was partially offset by a charge of approximately 16 million resulting from us state and local tax accruals recorded for uncertain tax positions net of us federal income tax benefit 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined based on the financial condition and prospects of our equity investee in egypt that there was an otherthantemporary decline in its carrying value as a result we recorded a 292 million  impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the investment to fair value the impairment charge is included in income loss from equity method investments in our income statement 

net income  omnicom group inc in 2012  increased 457 million  or 48  to 9983 million  from 9526 million  in 2011  the yearoveryear increase in net income  omnicom group inc is due to the factors described above diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc increased 84  to 361  in 2012  compared to 333  in 2011  due to the factors described above as well as the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding this reduction was the result of repurchases of our common stock net of stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 

critical accounting policies and new accounting standards 

critical accounting policies 

the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes including note 2 significant accounting policies  for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates  our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our costmethod investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

acquisitions and goodwill  we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in making acquisitions the valuation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation competitive position geographic coverage and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and accordingly the assets acquired including identified intangible assets the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values in circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100 of an entity is acquired we record 100 of the goodwill acquired acquisitionrelated costs including advisory legal accounting valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations earnouts contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as liabilities at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date in 2012  we completed 13  acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in businesses in which we had an existing minority ownership interest goodwill from these transactions was 2351 million  in addition for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 we made contingent purchase price payments earnouts of 404 million  which were included in goodwill contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 are accrued in accordance with us gaap when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain at december 31 2012  the amount we could be required to pay for earnouts for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 is 157 million  

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach andor their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the knowhow of the people which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and the guidance set forth in fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics the main economic components of each agency are 

employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 

goodwill impairment review  estimates and assumptions  we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar purchase acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” 

the range of assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june 30 2012  and 2011  were 



longterm growth rate represents our estimate of the longterm growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past ten years was approximately 75  and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising our major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was 43 over the same period we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2012  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp we also believe based on our historical performance that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth in the markets we operate in for our annual test as of june 30 2012  we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 4 for our reporting units 

when performing our annual impairment test as of june 30 2012  and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we considered the current macroeconomic environment as well as industry and market specific conditions at midyear 2012 in the first half of 2012 we experienced an increase in our revenue of 51 which excludes growth from acquisitions and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates however the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the euro zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets we considered the effect of these conditions in our annual impairment test as a result we estimated growth rates for the next six years that reflect a reduction from current business results 

the riskadjusted discount rate used in our dcf analysis represents the estimated aftertax wacc for each of our reporting units and ranged from 103  to 109  the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt the decrease in the wacc at june 30 2012  compared to june 30 2011 was primarily the result of a decrease in the longterm us treasury bond the riskfree rate of return used as a component that we use in   determining the wacc 

our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase transactions and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

goodwill impairment review  conclusion  under us gaap we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the carrying value of of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to step 1 of the goodwill impairment test although not required we performed step 1 of the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value including goodwill based on the results of our impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired at june 30 2012  because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective net book value the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test was approximately 70 notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our wacc and longterm growth rate are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june 30 2012  revealed that if wacc increased by 1 andor longterm growth rate decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and would pass step 1 of the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim evaluation for impairment the estimates we use in testing our goodwill for impairment do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step 1 of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have 

an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

subsequent to our annual evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill at june 30 2012  there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim evaluation for impairment at december 31 2012 given the current economic climate we reviewed the assumptions used in our june 30 2012 annual impairment test for revenue growth cash flows wacc and longterm growth rate our actual 2012 results for revenue growth and cash flows approximated the forecast for revenue growth and cash flows that we used in our impairment test at june 30 2012 our assumptions for revenue growth and cash flows for 2013 approximate our current 2013 forecast we also reviewed the assumptions used for wacc and longterm growth rate using data at december 31 2012 the assumptions are within the 1 change used in our sensitivity analysis at june 30 2012 based on these factors we did not perform an interim evaluation for impairment on the carrying value of goodwill at december 31 2012 additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 2 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition  and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable and delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines advertising crm public relations and specialty communications certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned although we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with thirdparty suppliers are excluded from our revenue in certain arrangements we act as principal and we contract directly with thirdparty suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are responsible for payment in these circumstances revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services 

some of our client contractual arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize performance incentives in revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients 

additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation   sharebased compensation is measured at the grant date fair value based on the fair value of the award we use the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock option awards this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation expense was 808 million  745 million  and 693 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements

the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

 revenue for 2012  and the percentage change in revenue and organic growth from 2011  in our primary geographic markets were in millions 

  

in 2012  changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 22  or 3100 million  compared to 2011  the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro brazilian real and british pound 

assuming exchange rates at february 1 2013  remain unchanged we expect changes in foreign exchange rates to have a marginally positive impact on 2013 revenue 

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2012  was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our largest client represented 26   of our revenue in each of 2012  and 2011  no other client represented more than 26  of our revenue in 2012  or more than 21  of our revenue in 2011  our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 190  and 517  of 2012  revenue respectively and 180  and 503  of 2011  revenue respectively

repositioning actions and remeasurement gain   in the first quarter of 2011 we recorded 1313 million  of charges related to our repositioning actions additionally in the first quarter of 2011 we recorded a 1234 million  remeasurement gain related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in the clemenger group our affiliate in australia and new zealand 

the impact on operating expenses of these transactions for the year ended december 31 2011 was in millions 



operating expenses salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue salary and service costs increased 13  in 2012  compared to 2011  salary and service costs for 2011  reflects 928 million  of charges related to our repositioning actions the increase in 2012  costs resulted from growth in our business as well as increased use of freelance labor partially offset by lower compensation costs including incentive compensation primarily as a result of the repositioning actions taken in 2011  and tight controls restricting the frequency of salary increases excluding the 928 million  of severance charges taken in 2011 salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue in 2012  would have been flat as compared to 2011  

office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs office and general expenses increased 43  in 2012  compared to 2011  office and general expenses for 2011  included a reduction of 849 million  which reflects the 1234 million  noncash remeasurement gain recorded in connection with the acquisition of the controlling interest in the clemenger group and charges of 385 million  related to our repositioning actions excluding the 849 million  net decrease office and general expenses in 2012  would have been flat as compared to 2011  

operating margins increased to 127  in 2012  from 120  in 2011  and ebita margins increased to 134  in 2012  from 127  in 2011  excluding the 1313 million  attributable to our repositioning actions and the 1234 million  remeasurement gain operating margin and ebita margin for 2011  would have been 121  and 128  respectively the yearoveryear margin improvement was driven by our revenue growth as well as lower operating costs resulting from the actions taken in 2011 to improve our operations rebalance our workforce and drive efficiencies in our back office functions 

net interest expense   net interest expense increased to 1446 million  in 2012  compared to 1221 million  in 2011  interest expense increased 216 million  to 1797 million  the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of 750 million of our 3625 senior notes due may 1 2022 or the 2022 notes in april 2012 and 500 million of the 2022 notes in august 2012 the total outstanding principal amount of the 2022 notes is 125 billion the 2022 notes issued in august were issued at an issue price of 105287 reflecting a yield to maturity of 299 the increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in 2012  interest income increased 09 million  to 351 million  in 2012  see “liquidity and capital resources” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters 

income taxes  our effective tax rate for 2012    decreased  to 318  compared to 327  for 2011  in the fourth quarter of 2012 income tax expense was reduced by 53 million primarily resulting from a reduction in the deferred tax liabilities for unremitted foreign earnings of certain of our operating companies located in the asia pacific region as well as lower statutory tax rates in other foreign jurisdictions in an effort to support our continued expansion and pu r sue operational efficiencies in the asia pacific region we completed a legal reorganization in certain countries within the region as a result of the reorganization our unremitted foreign earnings in the affected countries are subject to lower effective tax rates as compared to the us statutory tax rate therefore we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower tax rate that these earnings are subject to in future periods we expect an ongoing annual reduction in income tax expense of approximately 11 million the reduction in income tax expense was partially offset by a charge of approximately 16 million resulting from us state and local tax accruals recorded for uncertain tax positions net of us federal income tax benefit we expect our effective tax rate for 2013 to approximate 336 

income tax expense for 2011  reflects a number of items that were recorded in the first quarter of 2011 these items include a 395 million tax benefit related to charges incurred in connection with our repositioning actions a provision of 28 million related to the remeasurement gain and a provision of 90 million for agreed upon adjustments to income tax returns that were under examination in 2011 excluding these items our effective tax rate for 2011 would have been 343 

income loss from equity method investments in the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined based on the financial condition and prospects of our equity investee in egypt that there was an otherthantemporary decline in its carrying value as a result we recorded a 292 million  impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the investment to fair value excluding the impairment charge income from equity method investments decreased 30 million to 142 million in 2012  from 172 million   2011

in 2011  changes in foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 26  or 3234 million  compared to 2010  the most significant impacts resulted from the weakening of the us dollar against the euro australian dollar and british pound 

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2011  was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our largest client represented 26  and 30  of our revenue in 2011  and 2010  respectively no other client represented more than 21  of our revenue in 2011  or more than 24  of our revenue in 2010  our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 180  and 503  of 2011  revenue respectively and 180  and 506  of 2010  revenue respectively 

revenue for 2011  and 2010  and the percentage change in revenue and organic growth from 2010  by discipline was in millions 



we operate in a number of industry sectors the percentage of our revenue by industry sector for 2011  and 2010  was 



operating expenses  operating expenses for 2011  compared to 2010  were in millions 



repositioning actions and remeasurement gain   in the first quarter of 2011 we recorded 1313 million  of charges related to our repositioning actions additionally in the first quarter of 2011 we recorded a 1234 million  remeasurement gain related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in the clemenger group our affiliate in australia and new zealand 

the impact on operating expenses of these transactions for the year ended december 31 2011 was in millions 



operating expenses  salary and services costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue salary and service costs increased 112  in 2011  compared to 2010  this increase reflects growth in our business as well as increased compensation costs including freelance labor and incentive compensation and an increase in severance of approximately 100 million to 201 million including our repositioning actions in the first quarter of 2011 the increase in salary and service costs was partially offset by the associated cost savings from these head count reductions 

office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs office and general expenses increased 44  in 2011  compared to 2010  reflecting a decrease of 1234 million related to the noncash remeasurement gain recorded in connection with the acquisition of the controlling interest in the clemenger group in the first quarter of 2011 partially offset by 385 million of charges related to our repositioning actions in the first quarter of 2011 excluding the net decrease of 849 million related to the remeasurement gain and the charges for our repositioning actions office and general expenses were 20357 million  in 2011  an increase of 90  

as a result of the above changes operating margins increased to 120  in 2011  from 116  in 2010  and ebita margins increased to 127  in 2011  from 122  in 2010  

net interest expense  net interest expense increased to 1221 million  in 2011  as compared to 1098 million  in 2010  interest expense increased 234 million  to 1581 million  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of our 445 senior notes due 2020 in august 2010 partially offset by a net reduction in interest expense resulting from the interest rate swaps on our 2016 notes entered into in august 2010 the interest rate swaps were settled with the counterparties in august 2011 resulting in a deferred gain of 332 million that is being amortized over the remaining life of the 2016 notes as a reduction of interest expense interest income increased 111 million  to 360 million  in 2011  this increase in interest income was attributable to higher foreign cash balances available for investment 

income taxes  our effective tax rate for 2011  decreased to 327  compared to 341  in 2010  the decrease in the effective tax rate was caused by the following items recorded in the first quarter of 2011 in millions 



the tax benefit on the repositioning actions was calculated based on the jurisdictions where the charges were incurred and reflects the likelihood that we will be unable to obtain a tax benefit for all charges incurred the remeasurement gain resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interest in clemenger created a difference between the book basis and tax basis of our investment because this basis difference is not expected to reverse no deferred taxes were provided and the tax provision recorded represents the incremental us tax on acquired historical unremitted earnings the 90 million  charge resulted from adjustments to us income tax returns for calendar years 2005 2006 and 2007 that were agreed upon and recorded in the first quarter of 2011 the examination of those returns is closed 

net income per common share  omnicom group inc  for the foregoing reasons net income  omnicom group inc in 2011  increased 1249 million  or 151  to 9526 million  compared to 8277 million  in 2010  diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc increased 233  to 333  in 2011  as compared to 270  in 2010  due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding this reduction was the result of repurchases of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2010  through 2011  net of stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements including contractual obligations 

historically the majority of our nondiscretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes and convertible notes our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations as well as contingent purchase price obligations earnouts related to acquisitions made in prior years 

our principal discretionary cash uses include dividend payments capital expenditures payments for strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock in december 2012 we paid the fourth quarter dividend on our common stock that historically has been paid in january of the following year our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand in addition depending on the level of our discretionary activity and conditions in the capital markets we may use other available sources of funding such as issuing commercial paper borrowing under our credit agreement or other longterm borrowings to finance these activities we expect that we should be able to fund both our nondiscretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending for 2013 without incurring additional longterm debt however we may access the capital markets at any time if favorable conditions exist to take advantage of historically low borrowing rates in april 2012 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 notes at an issue price of 99567 in august 2012 we issued an additional 500 million of our 2022 notes at an issue price of 105287 reflecting a yield to maturity of 299 as a result of these issuances we were able to reduce our total commercial paper issuances in 2012  by 39 compared to 2011  as well as increase our cash balances from december 31 2011  

we have a seasonal cash requirement normally peaking during the second quarter primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations this typically results in a net borrowing requirement that decreases over the course of the year 

at december 31 2012  our cash and cash equivalents increased  by 8971 million  from december 31 2011  the components of the increase for 2012  are in millions 



principal cash sources and principal cash uses amounts are nongaap financial measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our statement of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding the primary sources and primary uses of our cash flow nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

cash management 

we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia the treasury centers are managed by our whollyowned finance subsidiaries each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to access local currency uncommitted lines of credit the credit agreement or issue up to a total of 15 billion of us dollardenominated commercial paper this process enables us to manage our debt balances more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as better manage our risk to foreign exchange rate changes in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted lines of credit 

our cash and cash equivalents increased   8971 million  and our shortterm investments decreased   32 million  from december 31 2011  shortterm investments principally consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash within our current operating cycle generally one year 

at december 31 2012  our foreign subsidiaries held 20211 million  of our total cash and cash equivalents of 26783 million  the majority of this cash is available to us net of any taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states changes in international tax rules or changes in us tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

we have policies governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents in countries where we conduct treasury operations generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to our credit agreement these financial institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings we have deposit limits for each of these institutions in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations we ensure that all cash is held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 

our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased   8939 million  from the prior year end partially reflecting the issuance of 125 billion of our 2022 notes as a result our net debt position which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 3683 million  as compared to the prior yearend as follows in millions 



net debt is a nongaap financial measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management performance nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

debt instruments and related covenants 

we have committed and uncommitted lines of credit we have a 25 billion  committed line of credit or credit agreement with a consortium of banks expiring on october 12 2016  we have the ability to classify borrowings under the credit agreement as longterm the credit agreement provides support for up to 15 billion  of commercial paper issuances as well as backup liquidity in the event that any of our convertible notes are put back to us 

depending on market conditions at the time we typically fund our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper borrowing under our uncommitted lines of credit or borrowing under our credit agreement at december 31 2012  there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit agreement 

commercial paper activity for the three years ended december 31 2012  was dollars in millions 



the reduction in commercial paper borrowings in 2012  as compared to 2011  is a result of the issuance of our 2022 notes 

at december 31 2012  shortterm borrowings of 64 million  represent bank overdrafts and lines of credit of our international subsidiaries these bank overdrafts and lines of credit are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the agreements supporting the facilities 

the credit agreement contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreement these financial covenants limit the leverage ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda to no more than 3 times for the most recently ended 12month period under the credit agreement ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization we are also required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least 5 times for the most recently ended 12month period at december 31 2012 we were in compliance with these covenants as our leverage ratio was 21 times and our interest coverage ratio was 116 times  the credit agreement does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends 

sp rates our longterm debt bbb and moody’s rates our longterm debt baa1 our shortterm debt credit ratings are a2 and p2 by the respective rating agencies our outstanding 590 senior notes due april 15 2016 625 senior notes due july 15 2019 445 senior notes due august 15 2020 and 3625 senior notes due may 1 2022 collectively the senior notes convertible notes and credit agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded however the interest rates and fees on the credit agreement will increase if our longterm debt credit ratings are lowered 

omnicom capital inc or oci our whollyowned finance subsidiary together with us is a coobligor under our senior notes and convertible notes our senior notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of us and oci and we unconditionally guarantee ocis obligations with respect to the senior notes and the convertible notes oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries ocis assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions on the ability of oci or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances our senior notes and convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

at december 31 2012  the carrying value of our debt and amounts available under the credit agreement were in millions 



credit markets and availability of credit 

we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and actively manage our discretionary expenditures and we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients we believe that these actions in addition to operating cash from and the availability of our credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs and our discretionary spending 

in funding our daytoday liquidity we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market we expect to continue funding our daytoday liquidity through the commercial paper market however prior disruptions in the credit markets led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads during these periods of 

disruption we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit agreement to mitigate these conditions and to fund our daytoday liquidity we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets 

on june 15 2013  4066 million  of our 2038 notes may be put back to us for repurchase and on july 31 2013  2527 million  of our 2032 notes may be put back to us for repurchase if our convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit agreement to fund our cash requirements we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any repurchase 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of business the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations at december 31 2012  were in millions 



contractual commitments at december 31 2012  were in millions 



on june 15 2013  4066 million  of our 2038 notes may be put back to us for repurchase and on july 31 2013  2527 million  of our 2032 notes may be put back to us for repurchase if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date 6594 million  of convertible notes could be due in 2013 at december 31 2012  we classified our convertible notes as longterm in our balance sheet because our credit agreement does not expire until october 2016 and it is our intention to fund any repurchase with the credit agreement 

consistent with our acquisition strategy and past practice certain of our acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earnouts we use contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired business during the postacquisition transition period contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as liabilities at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations 

the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and liability for our postemployment arrangements was  2444 million  at december 31 2012  in 2012  we contributed 91 million  to our defined benefit pension plans and paid  103 million  in benefits for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2013 

the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 

in the normal course of business we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and in many cases obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance further in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers in addition our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client however the agreements entered into as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients however the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend as a global service business we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of interest rate changes we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives for foreign currency exposure derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations for interest rate exposure derivatives have been used to manage the related cost of debt 

as a result of using derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a valueatrisk analysis or var var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool based on the results of the model we estimate with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value on our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2012  was not material 

because we use foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

foreign exchange risk 

our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in their local currency the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements for the most part revenue and the expenses associated with that revenue are denominated in the same currency this minimizes the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations 

while our major nonus currency markets are the european monetary union or the emu the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan our agencies conduct business in more than 50 different currencies as an integral part of our treasury operations we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds 

in certain circumstances instead of using a multicurrency pool operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions we use forward foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2012  we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of 1815 million  mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany borrowing and investment activities 

also we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts at december 31 2012  we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of 636 million  mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these activities 

by using these financial instruments we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 

interest rate risk 

from time to time we issue debt in the capital markets in prior years we have used interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest cost at december 31 2012  there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 

on june 15 2013  4066 million  of our 2038 notes may be put back to us for repurchase and on july 31 2013  2527 million  of our 2032 notes may be put back to us for repurchase as we have done on prior occasions we may offer a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to the noteholders to induce them not to put their notes to us if we decide to pay a supplemental interest payment the amount offered would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the put date including the price of our common stock shortterm interest rates and a factor for credit risk 

if our convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit agreement to fund our cash requirements we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of operations after the repurchase additionally if the convertible notes are put back to us our interest expense will change the extent if any of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that is refinanced when we refinance the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing 

even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollarfordollar basis it would have no impact on either our leverage ratio or our debt to capital ratio if we were to replace our convertible notes with interestbearing debt at prevailing rates this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our interest coverage ratio however the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio are currently well within the covenant thresholds if either our leverage ratio was to increase 40 or our interest coverage ratio was to halve we would still be in compliance with these covenants therefore based on our current ratios our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets we believe any increase in the interest coverage ratio and reduction in the leverage ratio would still place us comfortably above the covenant requirements 

credit risk 

we provide advertising marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 26  of our 2012  revenue and no other client accounted for more than 26  of our 2012  revenue however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and in many cases obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance further in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers in addition our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client however the agreements entered into as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients however the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn

business 

tableend our business  omnicom a strategic holding company was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we are a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company and we operate in a highly competitive industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures 

our agencies operate in all major markets around the world and provide a comprehensive range of services which we group into four fundamental disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and specialty communications the services included in these disciplines are 



although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific consulting services 

our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to deliver our services and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model demands that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it differentiates us from our competitors 

our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines and geographies this means that the delivery of our services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously further we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for advertising and marketing communications services our overarching business strategy is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients 

the various components of our business and material factors that affected us in 2011  are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or mda of this report none of our acquisitions or dispositions in 2011  2010  or 2009  were material to our financial position or results of operations for information concerning our acquisitions see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

geographic regions and segments  our revenue is almost evenly divided between our united states and international operations for financial information concerning our domestic and international operations and segment reporting see our mda and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

our clients  consistent with our fundamental business strategy our agencies serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients across a variety of geographic regions and locations our clients operate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy furthermore in many cases our agencies or networks serve different brand andor product groups within the same clients served by our other agencies or networks for example in 2011  our largest client was served by more than 200 of our agencies and represented 26  of our 2011  revenue no other client accounted for more than 21  of our 2011  revenue our top 100 clients ranked by revenue were each served on average by more than 50 of our agencies in 2011  and collectively represented approximately 50 of our 2011  revenue 

our employees  at december 31 2011  we employed approximately 70600  people we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements the skillsets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency see our mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations 

executive officers of the registrant  as of february 10 2012  our executive officers are 



each executive officer has held his present position for at least five years 

additional information about our directors and executive officers will appear under the captions “corporate governance” “transactions with related persons” “election of directors” “executive compensation” and “stock ownership” in our definitive proxy statement which is expected to be filed with the sec by april 12 2012

risk factors 

tableend global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position 

our business and financial performance are impacted by global economic conditions in 2011 the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand however europe continued to experience economic difficulty and the economic conditions in europe continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing european sovereign debt crisis if the economic conditions worsen the downturn may expand beyond europe and could cause reductions in client spending levels and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions client spending and other factors and in response to reductions in client spending if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions reductions in client spending patterns changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors including us if that were to occur we may require additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms if at all such circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in a period of severe economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase 

in the normal course of business we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed the revenue from our services many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal the media commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and in many cases obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance further in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers in addition our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client however the agreements entered into as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

a reduction in client spending or a delay in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital consequently we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms if at all such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

companies periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

the markets we operate in are highly competitive key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

our employees are our most important assets our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

further as our business continues to become integrated with the digital marketplace we are increasingly dependent on the technical skills of a highly skilled workforce and their ability to maintain the skills necessary to serve our clients 

approximately 50 of our 2011 revenue came from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact our results of operations and financial position 

our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns or they could reduce future spending a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we rely extensively on information technology systems 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions summarize results and manage our business including maintaining client marketing and advertising information our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to outages malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public additionally we utilize third parties including cloud providers to store transfer or process data while we have taken prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent outages or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our reputation or business 

government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in addition there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in the future 

government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies as advertising mediums these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad including political instability and foreign exchange controls which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions competition for client assignments and talented staff new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations the risks of doing business abroad including political instability and foreign exchange controls do not affect domesticfocused firms these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position for financial information on our operations by geographic area see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 

we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include slower payment of invoices social political and economic instability and foreign exchange controls in addition commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague inconsistently administered and frequently changed if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase up to 660 million of notes in whole or in part on specific dates in the future 

on july 31 2012  2527 million  of our convertible notes due july 31 2032  or the 2032 notes  may be put back to us for repurchase and on june 17 2013  4066 million  of our convertible notes due july 1 2038  or the 2038 notes  may be put back to us for repurchase if our convertible notes are put back to us we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the repurchases we also believe that we will have sufficient capacity under our 25 billion credit agreement or credit agreement to meet our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any repurchase however in the event that availability under our credit agreement or our cash flow from operations were to decrease we may need to seek additional funding there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms if at all 

downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 

standard and poor’s rating service or sp rates our longterm debt bbb  and moody’s investors service or moodys rates our longterm debt baa1  our shortterm debt ratings are a2  and p2  by the respective agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and credit agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade however the interest rates and fees on our credit agreement would increase if our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded additionally our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our shortterm or longterm debt credit ratings 

furthermore the 2032  notes and 2038  notes are convertible at specified ratios if in the case of the 2032  notes our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by sp or baa3 or lower by moody’s or in the case of the 2038  notes to bbb or lower by sp and ba1 or lower by moody’s these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the evaluation we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

goodwill may become impaired 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities which principally represents the specialized knowhow of the workforce at the acquired businesses as discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting impairment charge although noncash could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

although our businesses may not be directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other requirements to reduce emissions we could be in the future however we could also be affected indirectly by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs at this time we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines advertising customer relationship management or crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our clients’ specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 

as a leading global advertising marketing and corporate communications company we operate in all major markets around the world we have a large and diverse client base our largest client accounted for 26  of our 2011 revenue and no other client accounted for more than 21  of our 2011 revenue our top 100 clients accounted for approximately 50 of our 2011 revenue our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 16  of our 2011 revenue although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns 

in 2011  our revenue increased 106  compared to 2010  the increase reflects strong operating performance by our agencies positive impact from foreign currency translation and an improvement in business conditions in our industry over 2010  revenue increased across all our disciplines and geographic areas driven by strong operating performance in most of the developed markets we operate in and continued growth in the emerging markets in asia and latin america 

our business and financial performance are impacted by global economic conditions in 2011 the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand however europe continued to experience economic difficulty and the economic conditions in europe continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing european sovereign debt crisis if the economic conditions worsen the downturn may expand beyond europe and could cause reductions in client spending levels and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions client spending and other factors and in response to reductions in client spending if necessary we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital there can be no assurance whether or to what extent our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions reductions in client spending patterns changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 

in the near term barring unforeseen events and excluding foreign exchange impacts as a result of increases in client spending and new business activities we expect our 2012  revenue to increase modestly in excess of average nominal gdp growth in our major markets we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities that will build on the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today 

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers we believe these trends have benefited our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 

effective february 1 2011  we acquired a controlling interest in the clemenger group our affiliate in australia and new zealand increasing our equity ownership to 737  from 467  in connection with this transaction we recorded a noncash gain of 1234 million  in the first quarter of 2011  resulting from the remeasurement of the carrying value of our equity interest to the acquisition date fair value this acquisition has and will continue to help us to further develop our combined businesses throughout the asia pacific region and further enhance our global capabilities 

we have an objective of improving ebita margins to 2007 levels for the full year 2012 in connection with this objective during 2011 we reviewed our businesses with a focus on enhancing our strategic position improving our operations and rebalancing our workforce as part of this process we disposed of certain noncore and underperforming businesses and repositioned others as a result of these actions we incurred charges of 1313 million  in the first quarter of 2011 for severance real estate lease terminations and asset and goodwill writeoffs related to disposals and other costs we expect that revenue from the acquisitions completed in 2011 will exceed the loss of revenue from these dispositions while the bulk of this process is behind us we continue to perform reviews of all our businesses and we will take actions where appropriate to reposition underperforming businesses during 2011 we incurred total severance charges of 201 million including the 928 million of severance costs incurred in the first quarter we will also continue to pursue operational consolidations to further drive efficiencies in our back office functions 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we review focus on revenue and operating expenses 

we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by major geographic location growth by major marketing discipline growth from currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients in recent years our revenue has been generally balanced between our domestic and international operations revenue in 2011 increased 106  compared to 2010 of which 61  was organic growth 26  was related to changes in foreign exchange rates and 19  was related to acquisitions net of dispositions across our geographic markets revenue increased 55  in the united states 125  in the united kingdom 49  in our euro markets and 307  in our other markets primarily asia and latin america the increase in revenue in 2011  compared to 2010  in our four fundamental disciplines was advertising 127  crm 114  public relations 60  and specialty communications 16  

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs technology costs depreciation and amortization and 

other overhead expenses each of our agencies requires professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are also similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software because we are a service business we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs in relation to revenue 

salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue salary and service costs increased 112  in 2011  compared to 2010  reflecting growth in our business as well as an increase in severance of approximately 100 million to 201 million including our repositioning actions in the first quarter of 2011 the increase in salary and service costs was partially offset by the associated cost savings from these head count reductions 

office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs office and general expenses increased 44  in 2011  compared to 2010  reflecting a decrease of 1234 million  related to the noncash remeasurement gain recorded in the first quarter of 2011 in connection with the acquisition of the controlling interest in the clemenger group partially offset by 385 million  of charges taken in the first quarter of 2011 related to our repositioning actions excluding the impact of the remeasurement gain and the impact of the repositioning actions office and general expenses increased by 90  in 2011  

net income  omnicom group inc in 2011  increased 1249 million  or 151  to 9526 million  from 8277 million  in 2010  the yearoveryear increase in net income  omnicom group inc is due to the factors described above diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc increased 233  to 333  in 2011  compared to 270  in 2010  due to the factors described above as well as the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding this reduction was the result of repurchases of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2010  through 2011  net of stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 

critical accounting policies and new accounting standards 

critical accounting policies 

the following summary of our critical accounting policies assists the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes including our discussion in note 3 describing our accounting policies in greater detail for a more complete understanding of critical accounting policies discussed below 

estimates  our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our costmethod investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred 

acquisitions and goodwill  we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in making acquisitions the valuation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors including specialized knowhow reputation competitive position geographic coverage and service offerings of the target businesses as well as our experience and judgment 

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values in circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100 of an entity is acquired we record 100 of the goodwill acquired acquisitionrelated costs including advisory legal accounting valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred any liability for contingent purchase price obligations earnouts is recorded at the acquisition date fair value subsequent changes in the fair value of the earnout liability are recorded in our results of operations the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date in 2011  we completed twelve  acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in businesses in which we had an existing minority ownership interest goodwill from these transactions was 6491 million  in addition for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 we made contingent purchase price payments earnouts of 792 million  which were included in goodwill 

a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 is contained in the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda the amount of contingent purchase price obligations is based on 

future performance contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 are accrued in accordance with us gaap when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain 

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach andor their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the knowhow of the people which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting  and the guidance set forth in fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics including similar costs and longterm profit contribution the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead expenses finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 

estimates and assumptions  goodwill impairment review  we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar purchase acquisition transactions 

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry we operate in as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units’ cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” 

the range of assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june 30 2011  and 2010  were 



longterm growth rates represent our estimate of a conservative longterm growth rate for the industry we operate in and the global economy the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past ten years was approximately 76  and the average gdp growth of the countries comprising our major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue or average nominal gdp was 40  over the same period we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2011  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp we also believe based on our historical performance that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth for our annual test as of june 30 2011  we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 40  for all of our reporting units 

when performing our annual impairment test as of june 30 2011  and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units we also considered the changes in the economic outlook in midyear 2011 in the first half of 2011 we experienced an increase in our revenue of 62 which excludes growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange movements we estimated growth rates for the subsequent six years that reflect a reduction from current business conditions 

the riskadjusted discount rate used in our dcf analysis represents the estimated wacc for each of our reporting units the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 a current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt the slight increase in the wacc used at june 30 2011  compared to june 30 2010  was primarily the result of an increase in the longterm us treasury bond the riskfree rate of return used 

sensitivity analysis and conclusion  goodwill impairment review  consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our reporting units have similar economic characteristics as the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs and other overhead expenses 

our reporting units do vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive the variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause the variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks including reporting unit 5 were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase transactions and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 

the decline in the fair value of our reporting units that would need to occur in order to fail step 1 of our goodwill impairment test the “threshold” is in millions 



based on the analysis described above we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of june 30 2011  because the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our wacc and longterm growth rate are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis on our annual impairment test as of june 30 2011  revealed that if our wacc was increased by 1 andor our longterm growth rate was decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and pass step 1 of the impairment test 

we will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim evaluation for impairment the estimates we use in testing our goodwill for impairment do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step 1 of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position subsequent to our annual evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill at june 30 2011 there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim evaluation for impairment

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition  and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable and delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines advertising crm public relations and specialty communications certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue in certain arrangements we act as principal and we contract directly with media providers and production companies and are responsible for payment in these arrangements revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services revenue is recorded net of sales use and value added taxes 

a portion of our client contractual arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients 

additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

employee sharebased compensation   employee sharebased compensation is measured at the grant date fair value based on the fair value of the award we use the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock option awards this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased employee compensation expense in 2011  2010  and 2009  was 745 million  693 million  and 786 million  respectively information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements

for 2011  foreign exchange impacts increased our revenue by 26  or 3234 million  compared to 2010  the most significant impacts resulted from the weakening of the us dollar against the euro australian dollar and british pound 

assuming exchange rates at february 10 2012 remain unchanged we expect foreign exchange impacts to decrease 2012 revenue by approximately 15 

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2011 was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our largest client represented 26  and 30   of our revenue in 2011 and 2010 respectively no other client represented more than 21  of revenue in 2011 or more than 24  of revenue in 2010  our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 180  and 503  of our 2011 revenue respectively and 180  and 506  of our 2010  revenue respectively

operating expenses  operating expenses for 2011  compared to 2010  were in millions 



repositioning actions and remeasurement gain   in the first quarter of 2011 we recorded 1313 million  of charges related to our repositioning actions additionally in the first quarter of 2011 we recorded a 1234 million  remeasurement gain related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in the clemenger group our affiliate in australia and new zealand the impact on operating expenses of these transactions for the year ended december 31 2011  was in millions 



operating expenses salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue salary and service costs increased 112  in 2011  compared to 2010  this increase reflects growth in our business as well as increased compensation costs including freelance labor and incentive compensation and an increase in severance of approximately 100 million to 201 million including our repositioning actions in the first quarter of 2011 the increase in salary and service costs was partially offset by the associated cost savings from these head count reductions 

office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs office and general expenses increased 44  in 2011  compared to 2010  reflecting a decrease of 1234 million  related to the noncash remeasurement gain recorded in connection with the acquisition of the controlling interest in the clemenger group in the first quarter of 2011 partially offset by 385 million  of charges related to our repositioning actions in the first quarter of 2011 excluding the net decrease of 849 million  related to the remeasurement gain and the charges for our repositioning actions 

office and general expenses were 20357 million  in 2011  an increase of 90  see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our repositioning actions 

as a result of the above changes operating margins increased to 120  in 2011 from 116  in 2010  and ebita margins increased to 127  in 2011  from 122  in 2010  

net interest expense   net interest expense increased to 1221 million  in 2011  compared to 1098 million  in 2010  interest expense increased 234 million  to 1581 million  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of our 445 senior notes due 2020 in august 2010 partially offset by a net reduction in interest expense resulting from the interest rate swaps on our 2016 notes entered into in august 2010 the interest rate swaps were settled with the counterparties in august 2011 resulting in a deferred gain of 332 million  that is being amortized over the remaining life of the 2016 notes as a reduction of interest expense interest income increased 111 million  to 360 million  in 2011  the increase in interest income was attributable to higher foreign cash balances available for investment 

see “liquidity and capital resources” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters 

income taxes   our effective tax rate for 2011  decreased to 327  compared to 341  for 2010  the decrease in the effective tax rate was caused by the following items recorded in the first quarter of 2011 in millions 

the tax benefit on the repositioning actions was calculated based on the jurisdictions where the charges were incurred and reflects the likelihood that we will be unable to obtain a tax benefit for all charges incurred the remeasurement gain resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interest in clemenger created a difference between the book basis and tax basis of our investment because this basis difference is not expected to reverse no deferred taxes were provided and the tax provision recorded represents the incremental us tax on acquired historical unremitted earnings the 90 million  charge resulted from adjustments to us income tax returns for calendar years 2005 2006 and 2007 that were agreed upon and recorded in the first quarter of 2011 the examination of those returns is closed

salary and services costs are comprised of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs salary and service costs increased 7636 million  in 2010  compared to 2009  salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased to 735  in 2010  compared to 721  in 2009  this increase resulted primarily from a combination of a change in our business mix and increased compensation costs primarily related to freelance labor and incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease in severance costs 

office and general expenses decreased 271 million  in 2010  compared to 2009  office and general expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 13  in 2010  compared to 2009  these costs are comprised of rent and occupancy costs technology costs depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses and are less directly linked to changes in our revenue included in office and general expenses is a 260 million noncash gain resulting from the remeasurement to fair value of our existing ownership interests in affiliates in the middle east and south america in which we acquired a controlling interest bringing our ownership up to 686 and 100 respectively further we recorded a 130 million charge primarily related to fixed asset impairment and other costs on the disposal of certain underperforming businesses in europe 

net interest expense  net interest expense increased to 1098 million  in 2010  as compared to 1007 million  in 2009  gross interest expense increased 125 million  to 1347 million  the increase was primarily due to increased interest resulting from our 625 senior notes issued in july 2009 our 445 senior notes issued in august 2010 and amortization of supplemental interest payments made on our convertible notes due 2038 this increase was partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from no borrowings under our credit agreement during 2010 and decreases in amortization of supplemental interest payments made in prior periods on our convertible notes due 2031 and our convertible notes due 2032 as well as a net reduction in interest expense on our 2016 notes resulting from our interest rate swap entered into in august 2010 gross interest income increased 34 million  to 249 million  in 2010  this increase was attributable to higher foreign cash balances available for investment and higher investment rates 

income taxes  our 2010  consolidated effective income tax rate was 341  which increased slightly from 340  in 2009  

net income per common share  omnicom group inc  for the foregoing reasons our net income  omnicom group inc in 2010  increased 347 million  or 44  to 8277 million  from 7930 million  in 2009  diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc increased 67  to 270  in 2010  as compared to 253  in the prior year the yearoveryear increase in diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc is due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding this reduction was the result of our purchases of our common stock during 2010 net of stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements including contractual obligations 

historically the majority of our nondiscretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes and convertible notes our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations earnouts related to acquisitions made in prior years 

our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders capital expenditures payments for strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock in addition we pay dividends to shareholders of noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries 

our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand in addition depending on the level of our discretionary activity we may use other available sources of funding such as issuing commercial paper borrowing under our credit agreement or other longterm borrowings to finance these activities we expect that we should be able to fund both our discretionary and nondiscretionary cash requirements for 2012 without incurring additional longterm debt however we may access the capital markets at any time if favorable conditions exist 

we have a seasonal cash requirement normally peaking during the second quarter primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent acquisition obligations this typically results in a net borrowing requirement that decreases over the course of the year and at the end of the calendar year we expect to have cash invested 

at december 31 2011 our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 5075 million  from december 31 2010  the components of the decrease for 2011 are in millions 

principal cash sources and principal cash uses amounts are nongaap financial measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our statement of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding the primary sources and primary uses of our cash flow nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

cash management 

we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia the regional treasury centers are managed by our whollyowned finance subsidiaries each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funding borrow funds from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to access local currency uncommitted lines of credit or the credit agreement or issue up to 15 billion of us dollardenominated commercial paper this process enables us to manage our debt balances more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively as well as better manage our risk to foreign exchange changes in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for local currency uncommitted lines of credit 

our cash and cash equivalents decreased 5075 million  and our shortterm investments increased 125 million  from december 31 2010  shortterm investments principally consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash within our current operating cycle generally one year 

at december 31 2011 our foreign subsidiaries held 10457 million  of our cash and cash equivalents these funds are used to manage the daytoday liquidity requirements of our international operations the majority of this cash is available to us net of any taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states changes in international tax rules or changes in us tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

we have policies governing counterparty credit risk with banks that hold our cash and cash equivalents generally in countries where we conduct treasury operations the bank counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to our credit agreement these banks have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings we have risk management limits for each of these banks and we monitor the global exposure on a daily basis in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations we ensure that all cash is held by bank counterparties that meet criteria based on credit ratings and other factors 

our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased 4950 million  from the prior year end as a result our net debt position which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 5119 million  as compared to the prior yearend as follows in millions 



net debt is a nongaap financial measure this presentation together with the comparable us gaap measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management performance nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 

debt instruments and related covenants 

in october 2011 we amended the credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity to 25 billion  from 20 billion and to extend the term to october 12 2016  there were no changes to the financial covenants in the credit agreement we have the ability to classify borrowings under the agreement as longterm the credit agreement provides support for up to 15 billion  of commercial paper issuances as well as backup liquidity in the event that any of our convertible notes are put back to us 

depending on market conditions at the time we typically fund our daytoday liquidity by issuing commercial paper borrowing under our uncommitted lines of credit or borrowing under our credit agreement at december 31 2011 there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit agreement 

for the three years ended december 31 2011 commercial paper activity was dollars in millions 



at december 31 2011 shortterm borrowings of 95 million  are comprised of bank overdrafts and lines of credit of our international subsidiaries these bank overdrafts and lines of credit are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the agreements supporting the facilities 

the credit agreement contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreement these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda under the credit agreement ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to no more than 30 times we are also required to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least 50 times at december 31 2011 we were in compliance with these covenants as our ratio of debt to ebitda was 17  times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was 123  times the credit agreement does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends 

sp rates our longterm debt bbb and moody’s rates our longterm debt baa1 our shortterm debt credit ratings are a2 and p2 by the respective agencies our outstanding 590 senior notes due april 15 2016 625 senior notes due july 15 2019 445 senior notes due august 15 2020 collectively the senior notes convertible notes and credit agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded however the interest rates and fees on the credit agreement will increase if our longterm debt credit ratings are lowered 

our senior notes and convertible notes were coissued by us and two of our whollyowned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc or oci and omnicom finance inc or ofi as coobligors our senior notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of the issuer and the coobligors and we unconditionally guarantee the obligations of oci and ofi with respect to the senior notes and the convertible notes our senior notes and convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 

oci and ofi provide funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci and ofi’s assets consist of intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions in the senior notes or convertible note indentures on the ability of oci ofi or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances 

at december 31 2011 outstanding debt amounts available under the credit agreement unamortized discount and deferred gain on interest rate swaps were in millions 

credit markets and availability of credit 

we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and actively manage our discretionary expenditures we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients we believe that these actions in addition to the availability of our credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs and our discretionary spending 

in funding our daytoday liquidity we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market we expect to continue funding our daytoday liquidity through the commercial paper market however prior disruptions in the credit markets led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads during these periods of disruption we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit agreement to mitigate these conditions and to fund our daytoday liquidity we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets 

the next date on which holders of our 2032 notes can put their notes back to us for cash is july 31 2012  the next date on which holders of our 2038 notes can put their notes back to us for cash is june 17 2013  if our convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit agreement to fund our cash requirements we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any repurchase 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of business the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations at december 31 2011 are in millions 



contractual commitments at december 31 2011 are in millions 



the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 

holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes then outstanding on specific dates in the future the next date holders of our 2032 notes can put the notes back to us is july 31 2012 the next date on which holders of our 2038 notes can put the notes back to us is june 17 2013 if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date 2527 million of convertible notes could be due in 2012 and 4067 million could be due in 2013 at december 31 2011 we classified our convertible notes as longterm in our balance sheet because our credit agreement does not expire until october 2016 and it is our intention to fund any repurchase with the credit agreement 

in the normal course of business we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed the revenue from our services many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and in many cases obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance further in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers in addition our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client however the agreements entered into as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients however the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn 

pension and postemployment funding  the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and postemployment arrangements at december 31 2011 was  2010 million  during 2011 we contributed 78 million  to our defined benefit pension plans and paid  107 million  in benefits for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2012 

contingent acquisition obligations  certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations earnouts we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired business during the postacquisition transition period these payments are not contingent upon future employment at december 31 2011 the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we could be required to pay for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels is approximately 503 million  of which 420 million  is due in 2012 the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent on future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in accordance with us gaap for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 we have not recorded a liability for these earnout obligations in our balance sheet since the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period changes in the acquired entities’ performances and changes in foreign currency exchange rates these differences could be significant 

contingent purchase price obligations related to acquisitions completed subsequent to december 31 2008 are recorded as a liability at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet this liability is remeasured at each reporting period and subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in our results of operations at december 31 2011 this liability totaled approximately 1426 million  of which 328 million  is current

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend as a global service business we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of interest rate changes we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives for foreign currency exposure derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations for interest rate exposure derivatives have been used to manage the related cost of debt 

as a result of using derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on credit ratings and other factors 

we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a valueatrisk analysis valueatrisk is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments the valueatrisk analysis on our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2011 indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial 

foreign exchange 

our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in the local currency the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 21 of our consolidated financial statements for the most part revenue and the expenses associated with that revenue are denominated in the same currency this minimizes the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates has on our results of operations 

while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies our major nonus currency markets are the european monetary union or the emu the united kingdom australia brazil canada china and japan as an integral part of our treasury operations we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds 

in certain circumstances instead of using a multicurrency pool operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with third party banks at december 31 2011 we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of 1208 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these intercompany borrowings and investments 

also we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and operating expenses are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are promptly settled or hedged in 

the foreign currency market with forward contracts at december 31 2011 we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of 716 million related to these activities 

the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program as a result of these financial instruments we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 

interest rate risk 

from time to time we issue debt in the capital markets in 2011 to manage our overall interest cost we used interest rate swaps to convert specific fixedrate debt into variablerate debt and designated the swaps as a fair value hedge see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swaps at december 31 2011 there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 

holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes then outstanding on specific dates in the future the next date on which holders of our 2032 notes can put the notes back to us is july 31 2012 and the next date on which holders of our 2038 notes can put the notes back to us is june 17 2013 as we have done on prior occasions we may offer a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to the noteholders to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us if we decide to pay a supplemental interest payment the amount offered would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date including the price of our common stock shortterm interest rates and a factor for credit risk 

if our outstanding convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit agreement to fund our cash requirements we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of operations after the repurchase additionally if the convertible notes are put back to us our interest expense will change the extent if any of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced when we refinance the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing 

even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollarfordollar basis it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio if we were to replace our convertible notes with interestbearing debt at prevailing rates this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios such as ebitda to interest expense however the coverage ratios in the credit agreement and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds if either our ratio of debt to ebitda was to increase 75 or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was to halve we would still be in compliance with these covenants therefore based on our current coverage ratios our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements 

credit risk 

we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 26  of our 2011 revenue and no other client accounted for more than 21  of our 2011 revenue however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change 

in the normal course of business we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and in many cases obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance further in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers in addition our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services we manage the risk 

of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client however the agreements entered into as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients however the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn

 item 1 business tableend our business omnicom a strategic holding company was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we are one of the world’s largest advertising marketing and corporate communications companies and we operate in a highly competitive industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients these developments make it increasingly more difficult for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures

our agencies operate in all major markets around the world and provide a comprehensive range of services which we group into four fundamental disciplines traditional media advertising customer relationship management “crm” public relations and specialty communications the services included in these disciplines are

 although the medium used to reach a client’s target audience may differ across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific consulting services

our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to deliver our services and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and

efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model demands that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it differentiates us from our competitors

our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines and geographies this means that the delivery of our services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously further we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for advertising and marketing communications services our overarching business strategy is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients

the various components of our business and material factors that affected us in 2010 are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” or mda of this report none of our acquisitions or dispositions in 2010 2009 or 2008 were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations for information concerning our acquisitions see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements

geographic regions and segments our revenue is almost evenly divided between our us and nonus operations for financial information concerning domestic and foreign operations and segment reporting see our mda and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

our clients consistent with our fundamental business strategy our agencies serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients across a variety of geographic regions and locations our clients participate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy furthermore in many cases our agencies or networks serve different brand andor product groups within the same clients served by our other agencies or networks for example our largest client was served by more than 100 of our agencies in 2010 and represented 30 of our 2010 revenue no other client accounted for more than 24 of our 2010 revenue our top 100 clients ranked by revenue were each served on average by more than 50 of our agencies in 2010 and collectively represented 506 of our 2010 revenue

our employees at december 31 2010 we employed approximately 65500 people we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements the skillsets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency see our mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend future global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position 

in 2010 our revenue increased 70 compared to 2009 the increase reflects an improvement in business conditions in our industry over 2009 however the pace of the global economic recovery is uneven and a future economic downturn could renew reductions in client spending levels and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions client spending and other factors and will take actions available to us to improve our cost structure and manage working capital in the current environment there can be no assurance of the effects of future economic conditions client spending patterns client creditworthiness and other developments on us and whether or to what extent our efforts to respond will be effective

conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit would make it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements and could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors including us if that were to occur we may require additional financing to fund our daytoday working capital requirements there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms if at all this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position

in a period of severe economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase 

in the normal course of business we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services provided many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal the media commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and in many cases requiring credit insurance or payment in advance further in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers in addition our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance however the agreements entered into as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

a reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

the recent global recession caused a reduction in the volume of client spending andor a delay in the time our clients took to pay us negatively affecting our working capital renewed global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to take the same or additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital consequently we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms if at all such circumstances could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

companies periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding from time to time clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 

our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected

our employees are our most important assets our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

further as the evolution of our business continues to become integrated with the digital marketplace we are increasingly dependent on the technical skills of a highly skilled workforce and their ability to maintain the skills necessary to serve our clients

we received approximately 506 of our revenue from our 100 largest clients in 2010 and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns or they could reduce future spending a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

we rely extensively on information technology systems 

we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions summarize results and manage our business including maintaining client marketing and advertising strategies the size and complexity of our technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology systems there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our reputation or business

government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action any limitation on the scope of

the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in addition there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in the future

government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

laws and regulations related to user privacy use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of the internet as an advertising medium these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad including political instability and foreign exchange controls which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

we face a number of risks normally associated with global services businesses the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions competition for client assignments and talented staff new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations the risks of doing business abroad including political instability and foreign exchange controls do not affect domesticfocused firms these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position for financial information on our operations by geographic area see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 

we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include slower payment of invoices nationalization social political and economic instability and currency repatriation restrictions in addition commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague inconsistently administered and retroactively applied if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position

holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to 660 million of notes in whole or in part at specified dates in the future 

in august 2011 2527 million of our convertible notes due july 31 2032 “2032 notes” may be put back to us for repurchase and in june 2013 4067 million of our convertible notes due july 1 2038 “2038 notes” may be put back to us for repurchase if we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts we also believe that we will have sufficient capacity under our credit facility to meet our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any put however in the event that our credit facility or our cash flow from operations were to decrease we may need to seek additional funding there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms if at all

downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt bbb moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility however would increase if our longterm debt credit rating is downgraded

additionally our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our shortterm or longterm debt credit ratings furthermore the 2032 notes and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios if in the case of the 2032 notes our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard  poor’s ratings service or baa3 or lower by moody’s investors service or in the case of the 2038 notes to bbb or lower by sp and ba1 or lower by moody’s these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the evaluation we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected

goodwill may become impaired 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap or gaap we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities which principally represents the specialized knowhow of the workforce at the acquired businesses as discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

although our businesses may not be directly affected by current cap and trade laws and current requirements to reduce emissions we could be in the future however we could also be affected indirectly by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs at this time we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client’s specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base

as one of the world’s leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we operate in all major markets of the global economy we have a large and diverse client base our largest client represented 30 of our 2010 revenue and no other client accounted for more than 24 of our 2010 revenue our top 100 clients accounted for 506 of our 2010 revenue our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 16 of our 2010 revenue from our 1000 largest clients although our revenue is generally balanced between the us and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns

in 2010 our revenue increased 70 compared to 2009 the increase reflects an improvement in business conditions in our industry over 2009 revenue increased across all our disciplines driven by economic recovery in the us and continued growth in the emerging markets in asia and latin america in europe we experienced a moderate increase in revenue in the uk while economic recovery has lagged in our euro markets we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions client spending and other factors and in response take actions available to us to improve our cost structure and manage working capital in the current economic environment there can be no assurance as to the effects on us of future economic conditions client spending patterns client creditworthiness and other developments and whether and to what extent our efforts to respond will be effective

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing interactive technologies and new media outlets additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers we believe these trends have benefitted our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us

in 2011 barring unforeseen events and excluding foreign exchange impacts we expect our revenues to increase as a result of continuing increases in client spending and the contribution of several small acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 we will continue to identify acquisition candidates that will build upon the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies in early february 2011 we acquired a controlling interest in the clemenger group our affiliate in australia and new zealand the additional 27 acquired brings our ownership up to almost 75 in connection with this transaction in the first quarter of 2011 we expect to record a noncash gain of approximately 120 million resulting from the remeasurement of the carrying value of our equity interest to the acquisition date fair value we believe that this acquisition will help us further develop our combined businesses throughout the asia pacific region

we have an objective of improving margins to 2007 levels in connection with achieving this goal we are in the process of a strategic review of our businesses that is focused on improving our strategic position and operations as part of this process we are evaluating our agencies to identify noncore and underperforming businesses that need to be repositioned or considered for disposal we expect that these actions will reduce revenue in the range of 250 million to 300 million on an annual basis we believe that on an annual basis the reduction in revenue will approximately equal the increase in revenue from our recent acquisitions we are also pursuing numerous operational consolidations to further drive efficiencies in our back office functions as a result of the actions to be taken in connection with our strategic review in the first quarter of 2011 we expect to incur charges ranging from 90 million to 110 million for severance lease termination and asset impairment costs

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we analyze are revenue and operating expenses

we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by major geographic location growth by discipline growth from currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients and growth by client industry group

in recent years our revenue has been divided almost evenly between our domestic and international operations in 2010 our revenue increased 70 of which 01 was related to changes in foreign exchange rates 05 was related to acquisitions net of dispositions and 64 was from organic growth across our geographic markets revenue increased 82 in the us 43 in the uk and 187 in our other markets primarily asia and latin america while in our euro markets revenue decreased 36 the increase in revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 in our four fundamental disciplines was traditional media advertising 71 crm 65 public relations 65 and specialty communications 92

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs technology costs depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses each of our agencies requires professionals with a skill set that is similar across our disciplines at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software

because we are a service business we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs as a percentage of revenue salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased to 735 in 2010 compared to 721 in 2009 the increase in salary and service costs resulted primarily from a combination of a change in our business mix and increased compensation costs primarily related to freelance labor and incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease in severance costs office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs office and general expenses decreased to 149 of revenue in 2010 compared to 162 in 2009

net income  omnicom group inc in 2010 increased 347 million or 44 to 8277 million from 7930 million in 2009 the periodoverperiod increase in net income  omnicom group inc is principally due to the factors described above partially offset by an increase in pretax net interest expense for 2010 of 91 million diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc increased 67  to 270 in 2010 as compared to 253 in the prior year period the yearoveryear increase in diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc is due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding this reduction was the result of our purchases of our common stock during 2010 net of stock option exercise and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan

we have prepared the following summary of our critical accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes including our discussion in note 3 setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail for a more complete understanding of critical accounting policies discussed below

estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our costmethod investments to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred

acquisitions and goodwill we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in making acquisitions the price we pay is based on an evaluation of various factors including specialized knowhow reputation competitive position geographic coverage and service offerings as well as our experience and judgment

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and accordingly the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values in circumstances where control is obtained and less than 100 of an entity is acquired we record 100 of the goodwill acquired acquisition related costs including advisory legal accounting valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred any liability for contingent purchase price obligations earnouts are recorded at the acquisition date at fair value changes in the fair value of the earnout liability are recorded in our results of operations the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date in 2010 we completed seven acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in businesses in which we had an existing minority ownership interest total goodwill additions from these transactions were 1236 million in addition and unrelated to the acquisitions completed in 2010 we made or accrued contingent purchase price payments of 1172 million which were included in goodwill

a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 is discussed in the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda the amount of contingent purchase price obligations is based on future performance contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 are accrued in accordance with us gaap when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain

our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach andor their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly as is typical in most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the knowhow of the people which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately for each acquisition we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts as well as trade names in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are 

responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we have concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in the asc consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics as the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs associated with providing professional services and office and general costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs that are generally limited to purchased computers servers and offtheshelf software and other overhead costs finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy

estimates and assumptions  goodwill impairment review we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar purchase acquisition transactions

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin ebitda tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry in which we operate as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions which have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units’ cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc”

the range of assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluation as of june 30 2010 and 2009 were 

 longterm growth rates represent our estimate of a conservative longterm growth rate for the industry in which we operate and the global economy the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past nine years was approximately 77 and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising our major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue “average nominal gdp” was 49 over the same period we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates to be used in our annual impairment test at june 30 2010 we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp we also believe based on our historical performance that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth for our annual test as of june 30 2010 beginning in 2016 we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 40 for all of our reporting units

when performing our annual impairment test as of june 30 2010 and estimating the future cash flows of all of our reporting units we also considered the changes in the economic outlook in midyear 2010 we experienced an increase in our revenue in the first half of 2010 of 61 of which 20 was due to foreign exchange movements this led us to estimate growth rates for the subsequent five years that reflect current business conditions and increase gradually throughout this period

the riskadjusted discount rate used in our dcf analysis represents the estimated wacc for each of our reporting units the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business 

characteristics comparable to our reporting units and 4 the current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt the reduction in the wacc used at june 30 2010 compared to june 30 2009 was primarily the result of a decrease in the longterm us treasury bond the riskfree rate of return used

sensitivity analysis and conclusion  goodwill impairment review consistent with our fundamental business strategy the agencies within our reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our reporting units have similar economic characteristics as the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs associated with providing professional services and office and general costs which include rent and occupancy costs technology costs and other overhead costs

our reporting units do vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive the variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause the variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks including reporting unit 5 were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase transactions and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt

the decline in the fair value of our reporting units that would need to occur in order to fail step one of our goodwill impairment test the “threshold” is as follows dollars in millions

 based on the analysis described above we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of june 30 2010 because the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our wacc and longterm growth rate are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis for our annual impairment test as of june 30 2010 revealed that if our wacc was increased by 1 andor our longterm growth rate was decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and pass step one of the impairment test

we plan to continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless certain events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim evaluation for impairment the estimates we use in testing our goodwill for impairment do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step one of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic 605 revenue recognition and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured we record revenue net of sales use and value added taxes certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines – traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications

more specifically our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection is reasonably assured because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue in certain arrangements we act as principal and we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and thirdparty production costs and are responsible for payment in these arrangements revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services

a portion of our client contractual arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements

employee sharebased compensation employee sharebased compensation is measured at the grant date fair value based on the fair value of the award we use the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation awards this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements

sharebased employee compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was 693 million 786 million and 593 million respectively information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements

new accounting standards 

additional information regarding new accounting guidance can be found in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements note 3 to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies

financial results from operations  2010 compared with 2009 

 revenue our 2010 revenue increased 70 to 125425 million from 117207 million in 2009 foreign exchange impacts increased revenue by 171 million acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by 556 million and organic growth increased revenue by 7491 million the components of total 2010 revenue changes in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were dollars in millions

 the components and percentages are calculated as follows

the foreign exchange impact is calculated by first converting the current period’s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue 125254 million for the total column in the table for the year the foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency 125425 million less 125254 million for the total column in the table for the year 

the acquisition component is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses less revenue of any business included in the prior period revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period 

organic growth is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth 

the percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component 117207 million for the total column in the table for the year 

revenue in 2010 and the percentage change from 2009 in our primary geographic markets were dollars in millions

 foreign exchange impacts increased our 2010 revenue by 171 million the most significant impacts resulted from the weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar brazilian real australian dollar south african rand and japanese yen partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and british pound

assuming exchange rates at february 15 2011 remain unchanged we expect foreign exchange impacts to increase our full year 2011 revenue by approximately 1

additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2010 was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our single largest client represented 30 and 31 of our revenue in 2010 and 2009 respectively no other client represented more than 24 of revenue in 2010 or more than 25 of revenue in 2009 our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 180 and 506 of our 2010 revenue respectively and 178 and 504 of our 2009 revenue respectively

operating expenses our 2010 operating expenses increased 7365 million or 71 to 110823 million from 103458 million in 2009 as shown below

 salary and services costs are comprised of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs salary and service costs increased 7636 million in 2010 compared to 2009 salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased to 735 in 2010 compared to 721 in 2009 this increase resulted primarily from a combination of a change in our business mix and increased compensation costs primarily related to freelance labor and incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease in severance costs

office and general expenses decreased 271 million in 2010 compared to 2009 office and general expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 13 in 2010 compared to 2009 these costs are comprised of rent and occupancy costs technology costs depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses and are less directly linked to changes in our revenue included in office and general expenses is a 260 million noncash gain resulting from the remeasurement to fair value of our existing ownership interests in affiliates in the middle east and south america in which we acquired a controlling interest bringing our ownership up to 686 and 100 respectively further we recorded a 130 million charge primarily related to fixed asset impairment and other costs on the disposal of certain underperforming businesses in europe

net interest expense net interest expense increased to 1098 million in 2010 as compared to 1007 million in 2009 gross interest expense increased 125 million to 1347 million the increase was primarily due to increased interest resulting from our 625 senior notes issued in july 2009 our 445 senior notes issued in august 2010 and amortization of supplemental interest payments made on our convertible notes due 2038 this increase was partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from no borrowings under our credit facility during 2010 and decreases in amortization of supplemental interest payments made in prior periods on our convertible notes due 2031 and our convertible notes due 2032 as well as a net reduction in interest expense on our 2016 notes resulting from our interest rate swap entered into in august 2010 gross interest income increased 34 million to 249 million in 2010 this increase was attributable to higher foreign cash balances available for investment and higher investment rates

see “liquidity and capital resources” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters

income taxes our 2010 consolidated effective income tax rate was 341 which increased slightly from the 2009 rate of 340

net income per common share  omnicom group inc for the foregoing reasons our net income  omnicom group inc in 2010 increased 347 million or 44 to 8277 million from 7930 million in 2009 diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc increased 67 to 270 in 2010 as compared to 253 in the prior year the yearoveryear increase in diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc is due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding this reduction was the result of our purchases of our common stock during 2010 net of stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan

financial results from operations  2009 compared with 2008 

 fourth quarter 2009 in the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded a net gain of 324 million related to transactions with affiliated companies the net gain was comprised of a 413 million noncash gain resulting from the remeasurement to fair value of our ownership interest in an affiliated company in which we acquired a controlling interest bringing our ownership up to 85 in december 2009 and was partially offset by impairment charges of 89 million principally related to the loss on the sale of an investment in an affiliated company in january 2010 also in the fourth quarter of 2009 we took a charge of 332 million in connection with the loss in the quarter of a significant client in the automotive sector primarily for severance and lease termination costs salary and service costs for 2009 reflect an increase in severance costs of 154 million related to the client loss office and general expenses for 2009 reflect a decrease of 146 million related to the remeasurement gain of 413 million offset by lease termination costs of 178 million related to the client loss and the impairment charges of 89 million on investments in affiliated companies

revenue our 2009 revenue decreased 123 to 117207 million from 133599 million in 2008 foreign exchange impacts decreased revenue by 4543 million acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 308 million and organic growth decreased revenue by 11541 million the components of total 2009 revenue changes in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” were dollars in millions

the components and percentages are calculated as follows

the foreign exchange impact is calculated by first converting the current period’s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue 121750 million for the total column in the table for the year the foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency 117207 million less 121750 million for the total column in the table for the year 

the acquisition component is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses less revenue of any business included in the prior period revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period 

organic growth is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth 

the percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component 133599 million for the total column in the table for the year 

revenue in 2009 and the percentage change from 2008 in our primary geographic markets were dollars in millions

 for the full year 2009 foreign exchange impacts decreased our revenue by 4543 million beginning late in the third quarter of 2008 and continuing through the third quarter of 2009 the us dollar strengthened against most other major currencies such as the british pound euro canadian dollar brazilian real and australian dollar

for the fourth quarter of 2009 foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by 1305 million the most significant impacts resulted from the weakening of the us dollar against the british pound euro brazilian real australian dollar and korean won

range of disciplines and group them into the four disciplines traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications revenue for 2009 and 2008 and revenue change for our four disciplines were

 operating expenses our 2009 operating expenses decreased 13247 million or 114 to 103458 million from 116705 million in 2008 as shown below

 salary and services costs are comprised of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs salary and service costs decreased 11096 million in 2009 compared to 2008 this reflects actions we took to reduce our workforce and contain compensation related costs in the face of reduced client spending salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 721 in 2009 compared to 716 in 2008 principally due to the yearoveryear increase in severance costs of 314 million that included severance costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 154 million related to the loss in the quarter of a client in the automotive sector

office and general expenses represented 183 and 181 of our operating expenses in 2009 and 2008 respectively office and general expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 04 in 2009 compared to 2008 these costs are comprised of rent and occupancy costs technology costs depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses and are less directly linked to changes in our revenue excluding the net impact of the remeasurement gain lease termination costs and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaling 146 million office and general expenses decreased 2005 million in 2009 compared to 2008 this decrease was primarily a result of our cost containment activities

net interest expense our net interest expense increased to 1007 million in 2009 as compared to 743 million in 2008 gross interest expense decreased 24 million to 1222 million the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower borrowings under our credit facility and commercial paper issuances that substantially offset the increased interest resulting from our 625 senior notes issued on july 1 2009 our gross interest income decreased 288 million to 215 million in 2009 this decrease was attributable to lower investment rates and foreign exchange impacts on the interest earned on our foreign cash balances

see “liquidity and capital resources” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters

income taxes our 2009 consolidated effective income tax rate was 340 which is slightly higher than our 2008 rate of 336 the increase in our effective tax rate was caused by higher foreign taxes including a tax expense incurred in 2009 of 129 million due to the 

resolution of an uncertain tax position for a foreign subsidiary this was substantially offset by a reduction in income tax expense in 2009 of 110 million from the recognition of foreign income tax credits

net income per common share  omnicom group inc for the foregoing reasons our net income  omnicom group inc in 2009 decreased 2073 million or 207 to 7930 million from 10003 million in 2008 diluted net income per common share  omnicom group inc decreased 194 to 253 in 2009 as compared to 314 in the prior year this periodoverperiod decrease was smaller than the decrease in net income  omnicom group inc due to the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements including contractual obligations 

historically the majority of our nondiscretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow cash on hand and shortterm investments working capital is our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement in addition we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes and convertible notes our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years

our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders payments for strategic acquisitions capital expenditures and repurchases of our common stock our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow cash on hand and shortterm investments in addition depending on the level of discretionary spending we may use other sources of available funding such as the issuance of commercial paper and borrowing under our credit facility or other longterm borrowings to finance these activities however we expect that over the course of 2011 we should be able to fund both our discretionary and nondiscretionary cash requirements without incurring additional longterm debt

we have a seasonal cash requirement peaking during the second quarter primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation income taxes and contingent acquisition obligations this typically will result in a net borrowing requirement that decreases over the course of the year we expect that all our treasury centers will have cash invested at the end of the calendar year at december 31 2010 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 7017 million from december 31 2009 the components of the increase in 2010 are dollars in millions

 principal cash sources and principal discretionary cash uses amounts are nongaap financial measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes and discretionary cash uses this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements

cash management 

we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our regional treasury centers in north america europe and asia the regional treasury centers are managed by our whollyowned finance subsidiaries each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funding borrow funds from their regional treasury center the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to access local currency uncommitted lines of credit our 20 billion credit facility or depending on market conditions at the time issue up to 15 billion of us dollardenominated commercial paper this process enables us to more efficiently manage our debt balances and effectively utilize our cash as well as better manage our risk to foreign exchange changes

in certain countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis we arrange for uncommitted local credit lines in those countries

our cash and cash equivalents increased 7017 million and our shortterm investments increased 35 million from the prior year shortterm investments principally consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle generally within one year

at december 31 2010 7153 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in the united states and the remainder was held internationally primarily in canada the united kingdom and hong kong the majority of our offshore cash is available to us as a source of funds net of any tax obligations or assessments

unrepatriated cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are considered to be invested indefinitely outside the united states in managing our daytoday liquidity and our longterm capital structure we do not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings determination of the amount of this tax liability is based on the rate differential of the us income taxes in excess of the foreign taxes on any remittances of the undistributed earnings and is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation changes in us tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business

during 2010 we opportunistically accessed the capital markets and issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 445 senior notes due august 15 2020 and repurchased 665 million of our convertible notes our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 7052 million from the prior year end as a result our net debt position which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and shortterm investments increased 2133 million as compared to the prior yearend as follows dollars in millions

 24

net debt is a nongaap financial measure we believe this presentation together with the comparable us gaap measures reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

in december 2010 we entered into a new credit facility expiring on december 9 2013 with a consortium of banks led by citibank jpmorgan chase and bank of america providing borrowing capacity of up to 20 billion as described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements the credit facility replaced our 25 billion credit facility that was due to expire in june 2011 our credit facility provides support for our commercial paper issuances as well as backup liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us during 2010 and 2009 we repurchased a total of 13820 million of convertible notes that were put at december 31 2010 the outstanding convertible notes totaled 6595 million depending on market conditions at the time we typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper borrowing under our uncommitted lines of credit or borrowing under our credit facility

for the three years ended december 31 2010 commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed credit facility were dollars in millions

 the combined maximum amount outstanding for our commercial paper and credit facility borrowings was 10506 million for 2010 17578 million for 2009 and 12542 million for 2008

at december 31 2010 shortterm borrowings of 502 million outstanding were comprised of bank overdrafts and credit lines by our international subsidiaries the bank overdrafts and credit lines are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the bank agreements supporting the facilities

our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreement these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda under our credit agreement ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to no more than 30 times in addition we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 50 times at december 31 2010 we were in compliance with these covenants as our ratio of debt to ebitda was 19 times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was 127 times in addition our credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends

in august 2010 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 445 senior notes due august 15 2020 the proceeds from the issuance before deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses were 9965 million

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt bbb moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt credit ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies our outstanding 590 senior notes due april 15 2016 625 senior notes due july 15 2019 445 senior notes due august 15 2020 collectively “senior notes” convertible notes and credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded the interest rates and fees on our credit facility however will increase if our longterm debt credit ratings are lowered

our senior notes and convertible notes were coissued by us and two of our wholly owned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc “oci” and omnicom finance inc “ofi” as coobligors our senior notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of the issuer and the coobligors and we unconditionally guarantee the obligations of oci and ofi with respect to the senior notes and the convertible notes our senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness

oci and ofi provide funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci and ofi’s assets consist of intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable there are no restrictions in the senior notes or convertible note indentures on the ability of oci ofi or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances

in june 2010 we amended the indenture relating to our 2038 notes to permit us to redeem our 2038 notes on june 17 2013 and june 15 2018 after june 15 2018 we can redeem the 2038 notes at any time additionally holders of 4032 million of our 2038 notes agreed to waive their right to contingent cash interest if payable from december 15 2010 through and including december 15 2013 holders of 34 million of our 2038 notes did not put their notes to us for purchase and did not consent to the amendments and 608 million aggregate principal amount of the 2038 notes were repurchased and retired

in august 2010 we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of the 1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 590 senior notes due april 15 2016 “2016 notes” attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate under the terms of these agreements we will receive fixed interest rate payments and will make variable interest rate payments on the total principal amount of the 2016 notes these agreements effectively convert the 2016 notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt from the inception of the swaps through the maturity of the 2016 notes the swaps qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes at inception and at december 31 2010 and are designated as a fair value hedge on the 2016 notes the variable interest rate we pay is based on the one month and three month us libor rate flat the fixed rate we receive is 1766 the swaps mature on april 15 2016 the same day as the 2016 notes the swaps are recorded in our balance sheet at fair value and the change in the fair value of the swaps and the change in the fair value of the 2016 notes the hedged item are recorded in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense we will continue to evaluate these arrangements for hedge accounting treatment at december 31 2010 we recorded a liability of 242 million representing the fair value of the swaps and we also recorded a decrease in the carrying value of the 2016 notes of 263 million reflecting the change in fair value of the 2016 notes from the inception of the fair value hedge the net change in fair value of the swap and the carrying value of the 2016 notes and any hedge ineffectiveness was not material to our results of operations

from time to time we have made noncontractual supplemental interest payments to holders of our convertible notes who did not put their notes back to us for repurchase on the respective put date or who agreed to certain amendments to the convertible note indentures the supplemental interest payments are amortized to interest expense ratably over the period to the next put date see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

holders of our convertible notes exercised their right to put their notes to us for repurchase at par on the respective put date for the two years ended december 31 2010 the following repurchases were made dollars in millions

 at december 31 2010 outstanding debt and amounts available under our credit facility were dollars in millions

 looking forward to 2011 we expect to continue to use our cash flow from operations to pay dividends and make capital expenditures as well as to repurchase our common stock and fund acquisitions additional information about our indebtedness is included in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

credit markets and availability of credit 

in december 2010 we entered into a new threeyear credit facility providing borrowing capacity of 20 billion the credit facility replaced our 25 billion credit facility that was due to expire in june 2011 during the term of the prior credit facility a maximum of 20 billion of our convertible notes could have been put back to us during the term of the new credit facility a maximum of 660 million of convertible notes can be put back to us accordingly we decreased the amount of our new credit facility by 500 million to 20 billion we believe the reduced amount is sufficient to satisfy the potential put of the total amount of convertible notes outstanding as well as provide the required support for issuances under our 15 billion commercial paper program

we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and we will continue to actively manage our discretionary expenditures we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients we believe that these actions in addition to the availability of our 20 billion credit facility are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital needs and our discretionary spending for additional information about our credit facility see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

in funding our daytoday liquidity we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market we expect to continue funding our daytoday liquidity need through the commercial paper market however prior disruptions in the credit markets led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads during these periods of disruption to mitigate these conditions and to fund our daytoday liquidity we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit facility we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of business the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements

contractual obligations at december 31 2010 are dollars in millions

 contractual commitments at december 31 2010 are dollars in millions

 the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities

holders of the convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future the next date holders of our 2032 notes may put the notes back to us for cash is august 2011 the next date on which holders of our 2038 notes may put the notes back to us for cash is june 2013 if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date 2527 million of convertible notes could be due in 2011 and  4067 million could be due in 2013 at december 31 2010 we classified our convertible notes as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet because our credit facility does not expire until december 2013 and it is our intention to fund any put with our credit facility

in the normal course of business we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and in many cases requiring credit insurance or payment in advance further in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers in addition our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance however the agreements entered into as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients however the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn

pension and postemployment funding the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and postemployment arrangements at december 31 2010 was 1808 million during 2010 we contributed 75 million to our defined benefit pension plans and paid 100 million in benefits for our postemployment arrangements we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2011

contingent acquisition obligations certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations often referred to as earnouts we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired business during the postacquisition transition period these payments are not contingent upon future employment at december 31 2010 the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels is approximately 115 million the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in accordance with us gaap we have not recorded a liability for these items in our consolidated balance sheet since the definitive amount was not determinable or distributable prior to january 1 2009 actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period changes in the performance of the acquired businesses and changes in foreign currency exchange rates these differences could be significant the contingent purchase price obligations as of december 31 2010 calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels are dollars in millions

 contingent purchase price obligations related to acquisitions completed subsequent to december 31 2008 are recorded as liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and are remeasured at each reporting period changes in fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations these liabilities are not included in the above amounts

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend as a global service business we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets in the normal course of business we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives for interest rate exposure derivatives are used to manage the related cost of debt for foreign currency exposure derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations

as a result of using derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate the counterparty credit risk we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on credit ratings and other factors

we evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a valueatrisk analysis valueatrisk is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments the valueatrisk analysis on our derivative financial instruments at december 31 2010 indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial

foreign exchange 

our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in the local currency the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 20 of our consolidated financial statements for the most part our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our results of operations

while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies our major nonus currency markets are the european monetary union emu the united kingdom japan brazil and canada as an integral part of our treasury operations we centralize our cash and use a multicurrency pool arrangement to manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of the treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds

in certain circumstances instead of using a multicurrency pool operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with an intercompany treasury center operating in a different currency to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with third party banks at december 31 2010 we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of 13000 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these intercompany borrowings and investments

furthermore we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency in these instances amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts at december 31 2010 we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of 518 million related to these activities

the forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program as a result of these financial instruments we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 

interest rate risk 

from time to time we issue debt in the capital markets in 2010 to manage our overall interest cost we used interestrate swaps to convert specific fixedrate debt into variablerate debt and designated the swaps as a fair value hedge see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swaps at december 31 2010 the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps was 10 billion

the holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount outstanding the next date on which holders of our 2032 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is august 2011 and the next date on which holders of our 2038 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june 2013 as we have done on prior occasions we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us 

if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date including our stock price shortterm interest rates and a factor for credit risk

if our outstanding convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put additionally if the convertible notes are put back to us our interest expense will change the extent if any of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced when we refinance the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing

even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollarfordollar basis it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio if we were to replace our convertible notes with interestbearing debt at prevailing rates this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios such as ebitda to interest expense however the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds if either our ratio of debt to ebitda was to increase 50 or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was to halve we would still be in compliance with these covenants therefore based on our current coverage ratios our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements

credit risk 

we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 30 of our revenue and no other client accounted for more than 24 of our revenue for 2010 however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change

in the normal course of business we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ creditworthiness and in many cases requiring credit insurance or payment in advance further in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers in addition our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance however the agreements entered into as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or on production costs incurred on behalf of our clients however the risk of a material loss could increase in a significant economic downturn

 item 1 business tableend our business omnicom a strategic holding company was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we are one of the world’s largest advertising marketing and corporate communications companies and we operate in a highly competitive industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented audiences these developments make it increasingly more difficult for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures

our agencies operate in all major markets around the world and provide a comprehensive range of services which we group into four fundamental disciplines traditional media advertising customer relationship management “crm” public relations and specialty communications the services included in these disciplines are

 although the medium used to reach a given client’s target audience may be different across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific consulting services

our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to structure our business offerings and allocate our resources based on the

specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model demands that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it differentiates us from our competitors

our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines this means that the delivery of these services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously further for the longer term we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for advertising and marketing communications services our overarching strategy for our business is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients

the various components of our business and material factors that affected us in 2009 are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” of this report none of our acquisitions or dispositions in 2009 2008 or 2007 were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations for information concerning our acquisitions see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements

geographic regions and segments our total revenue is almost evenly divided between us and nonus operations for financial information concerning domestic and foreign operations and segment reporting see our mda and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

our clients consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy our agencies serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients across a variety of geographic regions and locations our clients participate in virtually all industry sectors of the global economy furthermore in many cases our agencies or networks serve different product groups within the same clients served by our other agencies or networks for example our largest client was served by more than 100 of our agencies in 2009 and represented 31 of our 2009 revenue no other client accounted for more than 25 of our 2009 revenue our top 100 clients ranked by revenue were each served on average by more than 45 of our agencies in 2009 and collectively represented 504 of our 2009 revenue

our employees at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 63000 people we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements the skillsets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency see our mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our historical results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position 

contraction in the global economy led to reductions in advertising marketing and corporate communications services spending by both our us and international clients and was a significant factor to the yearoveryear decrease in our revenue in 2009 the decline was broadbased across most industries and geographic areas despite recent economic improvement a future economic downturn and a further reduction in consumer spending could result in further reduction in client spending levels that could adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial position

renewed turmoil in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

renewed turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit similar to the conditions experienced beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and continuing into 2009 would make it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements and could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors including us if that were to occur we could require additional capital to fund the changes in our daytoday working capital requirements there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms if at all this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position

additionally during the recent credit crisis several banks in the bank syndicate that supports our 25 billion credit facility received capital infusions from their central governments in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment as a result the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us and we could require additional capital further our 25 billion credit facility expires in june 2011 we expect to replace this facility with similar financing there is no assurance that such financing will be available on comparable terms if at all this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position

in a period of severe economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients could significantly increase 

in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ credit worthiness and in many

cases requiring credit insurance or payment in advance further in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers this risk could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

a reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could materially adversely affect our working capital 

working capital is a source of cash as we have historically run a negative working capital cycle during the year this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients including when we place media and incur production costs we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations

the global economic recession has caused and could continue to cause a reduction of the volume of client spending or a delay in the time our clients take to pay us which could negatively affect our working capital consequently we could need to obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms if at all such circumstances could therefore materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

companies periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients our revenue may be adversely affected which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel 

our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected

in addition we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel our employees are our most important assets our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

we received approximately 504 of our revenue from our 100 largest clients in 2009 and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects business and results of operations and financial position 

our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns or they could reduce future spending a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulation or other governmental action any such limitation on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in addition there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in the future

government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services these actions would cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad including political instability and foreign exchange controls which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions competition for client assignments and talented staff new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations there are risks of doing business abroad including those of political instability and foreign exchange controls which do not affect domesticfocused firms these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position for financial information on our operations by geographic area see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 

we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices nationalization social political and economic instability and currency repatriation restrictions among other risks in addition commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague inconsistently administered and retroactively applied if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business our prospects business financial position and results of operations in those countries could be harmed which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position

holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to 726 million in whole or in part at specified dates in the future 

in june 2010 our 2033 notes and 2038 notes aggregating 4675 million may be put back to us for repurchase and in july 2010 2527 million of our 2032 notes may be put back to us for repurchase if we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts we also believe that we will still have capacity under our existing credit commitments sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any put event however in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were to decrease we might need to seek additional funding alternatives there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms if at all

downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt a moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility however would increase if our longterm debt credit rating is downgraded additionally our access

to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short or longterm debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies furthermore the 2032 notes 2033 notes and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios if in the case of the 2032 notes our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard  poor’s ratings service or baa3 or lower by moody’s investors service or in the case of the 2033 notes and 2038 notes to bbb or lower by sp and ba1 or lower by moody’s these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses we believe may be complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the review we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected

goodwill may become impaired 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” or “gaap” we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities which principally represents the specialized knowhow of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting noncash impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 

although our companies may not be directly affected by current cap and trade laws and current requirements to reduce emissions we could be in the future however we could also be affected indirectly by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers additionally to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations we may need to incur additional costs at this time we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company providing professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we structure our business offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client’s specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically either currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base

as one of the world’s leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we operate in all major markets of the global economy we have a large and diverse client base our largest client represented 31 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 and no other client accounted for more than 25 of our 2009 revenue our top 100 clients accounted for 504 of our 2009 revenue our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 16 of our 2009 revenue from our 1000 largest clients although our revenue is generally balanced between the us and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to general economic downturns

during the year a difficult global economy and declining consumer spending and rising unemployment in most major markets and other factors led clients to reduce spending on the services that our agencies provide and therefore negatively impacted our revenue and our results of operations for 2009 in addition the weakening of most major currencies against the us dollar commencing late in the third quarter of 2008 contributed to a reduction in our revenue through the third quarter of 2009 however beginning late in the third quarter of 2009 most major currencies strengthened against the us dollar resulting in an increase in our revenue as a result of foreign exchange impacts of approximately 39 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008

the decline in our 2009 revenue was broadbased across most industries and geographic areas during previous periods of economic downturn our industry experienced slower growth rates and industrywide margin contractions while business prospects in our industry have stabilized continued economic uncertainty and reductions in consumer spending may result in further reductions in client spending levels that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we have and will continue to closely monitor economic conditions client spending and other factors and in response have taken and will take actions available to us to reduce costs and manage working capital in the current economic environment there can be no assurance as to the effects of future economic conditions client spending patterns client credit worthiness and other developments on us and whether and to what extent our efforts to respond to them will be effective

certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing interactive technologies and new media outlets additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers we believe these trends have benefitted our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we review are revenue and operating expenses

we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by major geographic location growth by major marketing discipline growth from currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients

in recent years our revenue has been divided almost evenly between domestic and international operations in 2009 our revenue declined 123 of which 34 was related to changes in foreign exchange rates 02 was related to the acquisition of entities net of entities disposed and 87 was a decrease in organic growth almost onethird of the decline in revenue in 2009 that is unrelated to foreign exchange rates and acquisitions net of dispositions was driven by reduced spending by our auto industry clients and another third from reduced spending by our clients on events and promotions and on advertising for recruitment the remainder of the decline in 2009 was the result of an overall reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our clients the total decline in revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 in our four fundamental disciplines was as follows traditional media advertising 100 crm 129 public relations 148 and specialty communications 176

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs technology related costs and depreciation and amortization each of our agencies requires service professionals with a skill set that is similar across our disciplines at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client’s brand and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software

because we are a service business we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs as a percentage of revenue salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue however salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 721 in 2009 compared to 716 in 2008 principally due to the yearoveryear increase of 314 million in severance costs that included severance costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 of 154 million related to the loss in the quarter of a client in the automotive sector this reflects the actions we took to reduce our workforce and contain compensation related costs in the face of reduced client spending office and general expenses not directly related to servicing clients are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs as a result office and general expenses increased to 162 of revenue in 2009 compared to 158 in 2008

net income – omnicom group inc in 2009 decreased 2073 million or 207 to 7930 million from 10003 million in 2008 the periodoverperiod decrease in net income – omnicom group inc is principally due to the factors described above as well as the increase in pretax net interest expense for 2009 of 264 million diluted net income per common share – omnicom group inc decreased 194 to 253 in 2009 as compared to 314 in the prior year period

critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies 

we have prepared the following summary of our critical accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related discussion in this mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes including our discussion in note 3 setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail for a more complete understanding of critical accounting policies discussed below

estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a reporting period a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under codification topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other and when evaluating costmethod investments that consist of ownership interests in nonpublic companies to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred

acquisitions and goodwill we have historically made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in making acquisitions the price we pay is based on an evaluation of various factors including specialized knowhow reputation competitive position geographic coverage and service offerings as well as our experience and judgment

on january 1 2009 we adopted revisions to us gaap included in codification topic 805 business combinations these revisions require among other things that the acquirer record 100 of the goodwill acquired and the associated noncontrolling interest when less than 100 of the target is acquired that all transaction costs are expensed as incurred and that a liability for contingent purchase price obligations earnouts if any is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and is remeasured at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recorded in our results of operations during 2009 we completed four acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in companies in which we had an existing minority ownership interest total additions to goodwill for these transactions was 766 million in addition we made or accrued contingent purchase price payments of 1332 million which were included in goodwill

a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations is set forth in the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda the amount of contingent purchase price obligations is based on future performance contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 are accrued in accordance with us gaap when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain

our acquisition strategy has been focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach andor their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly like most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value that we acquire is the knowhow of the people which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately for each of our acquisitions we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets the majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets that we acquire is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts when making the necessary assumptions in valuing these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for

delivering services to clients in their regions we then concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in the codification consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy and the provision of technology requirements which are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy

estimates and assumptions — goodwill impairment review we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units including 1 the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows 2 comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and 3 when available consideration of recent and similar purchase acquisition transactions

in the latter part of 2008 contraction in the global economy a decline in consumer spending rising unemployment and other factors accelerated the global recession the global recession reduced clients’ spending on the services that our agencies provide as a result our revenue and profit declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year a significant adverse change in business conditions typically triggers an evaluation of goodwill for impairment prior to the required annual review although the decline we experienced in our business on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter was not significant given the generally negative economic environment we updated our impairment analyses for each of our reporting units as of december 31 2008 and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired

in applying the income approach we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows “dcf” for each reporting unit which serve as the basis of our valuation these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin tax rates capital expenditures weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected longterm cash flow growth rates all these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses economic conditions related to the industry in which we operate as well as conditions in the global economy the assumptions which have the most significant affect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are 1 the expected longterm growth rate of our reporting units’ cash flows and 2 the weighted average cost of capital “wacc”

the range of assumptions used for the longterm growth rate and wacc in our evaluation as of june 30 2009 and december 31 2008 are as follows

 longterm growth rates represent the expected longterm growth rate for the industry in which we operate and the global economy the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past eight years was approximately 100 and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising our major markets which account for substantially all of our revenue “average nominal gdp” was 61 over the same period we considered this history when determining the longterm growth rates to be used in both our interim impairment test at december 31 2008 and in our annual impairment test at june 30 2009 we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp we also believe based on our historical performance that our longterm growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth

the riskadjusted discount rate used in our dcf analysis represents the estimated wacc for each of our reporting units the wacc is comprised of 1 a riskfree rate of return 2 a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 3 an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics

comparable to our reporting units and 4 the current aftertax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt

although the riskfree rate of return increased during the first half of 2009 several other components of our wacc decreased during the first half of 2009 these decreases which more than offset the increase in the riskfree rate and caused our overall assumed wacc to decline were comprised of a decrease in the business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units a systemic decrease in the risk premium on equity securities and a decrease in the cost of corporate debt in the marketplace the business risk index is based on a marketderived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market the index for the companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units as well as the index assigned to us has been trending downward except for a significant increase in the index late in 2008 the general decrease in risk premiums on equity securities compared to yearend 2008 is a result of the gradual return of investors to the equity markets in the first half of 2009 the decrease in the cost of corporate debt is a result of the narrowing of credit spreads on corporate debt that was attributable to the overall improvement in the capital markets in the first half of 2009 relative to the latter part of 2008

additionally when performing our interim impairment test as of december 31 2008 and estimating the future cash flows of all of our reporting units we considered the changes in the economic environment that occurred in late 2008 as well as the economic outlook in early 2009 we experienced a reduction in our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 of 70 and had less visibility than we historically have had at that time regarding nearterm client spending plans this led us to estimate for purposes of performing our interim impairment test a reduction in our revenue and cash flows for 2009 compared to 2008 for all of our reporting units and zero growth from those reduced levels for 2010 for all of our reporting units for the purposes of performing our interim impairment test we estimated that growth would return in 2011 at levels below our historical growth rates for an interim fouryear period

when performing our annual impairment test as of june 30 2009 and estimating the future cash flows of all of our reporting units we also considered the changes in the economic environment that occurred in late 2008 as well as the economic outlook in midyear 2009 although we experienced a reduction in our revenue in the first half of 2009 of 158 of which 73 was due to foreign exchange movements our visibility regarding nearterm clientspending plans improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 this led us to estimate for an interim fiveyear period for purposes of performing our annual impairment test a large reduction in our revenues and cash flows for the second half of 2009 compared to 2008 for all of our reporting units and 2 growth from those reduced levels for 2010 for all of our reporting units with growth slowly increasing in subsequent years but at levels well below our historical growth rates

for both our interim test as of december 31 2008 and our annual test as of june 30 2009 beginning in 2014 and 2015 respectively we used an estimated longterm growth rate of 45 for all of our reporting units

sensitivity analysis and conclusion — goodwill impairment review consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy the agencies within our reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our reporting units have similar economic characteristics as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy and the provision of technology requirements that are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software

our reporting units do vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them these differences drive the variations in fair value among our reporting units in addition these differences as well as differences in book value including goodwill cause the variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interest that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded the remaining two agency networks including reporting unit 5 were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase transactions and as a result they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt

the decline in the fair value of our reporting units that would need to occur in order to fail step one of our goodwill impairment test the “threshold” is as follows dollars in millions

 at december 31 2008 reporting unit 5 had the highest total revenue operating profit and enterprise value of our five reporting units and its fair value net of debt approximated the average of the total fair value of all of our reporting units however because it had the highest book value and debt relative to the other reporting units it had the lowest threshold as of december 31 2008 the longterm growth rate needed to achieve our future cash flow projections for reporting unit 5 to avoid failing step one of our december 31 2008 interim goodwill impairment test and thus potentially having a goodwill impairment charge was approximately 30 this growth rate would represent a 30 reduction in the longterm growth rate of 45 that we used in performing our interim impairment test at december 31 2008 we concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective book values and therefore our goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2008 the date of our interim impairment test

based on the analysis described above we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of june 30 2009 because the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our wacc and longterm growth rate are reasonable we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units the results of this sensitivity analysis for our annual impairment test as of june 30 2009 revealed that if our wacc was increased by 1 andor our longterm growth rate was decreased by 1 the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and pass step one of the impairment test

we plan to continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless certain events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim evaluation for impairment the estimates we use in testing our goodwill for impairment do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable but they are subject to change from period to period actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step one of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including its goodwill a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a noncash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

subsequent to our annual evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill at the end of the second quarter of 2009 there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim evaluation for impairment in addition our actual results for revenue growth and cash flows for 2009 have approximated the assumptions used in our testing as of june 30 2009 further those assumptions for revenue growth and cash flows for all reporting units for 2010 are less than or equal to our most current forecast for 2010 revenue growth and cash flows as of december 31 2009 in addition the comparable market participant multiples of ebitda we used in our june 30 2009 valuation have improved as of december 31 2009 based on these factors we did not perform an interim impairment evaluation on the carrying value of our goodwill at december 31 2009

additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 3 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with codification topic 605 revenue recognition and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis and revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured we

record revenue net of sales tax use tax and value added tax certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements

these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines – traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications

more specifically our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection is reasonably assured

because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements set forth above apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue in accordance with certain arrangements we act as principal and we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and thirdparty production costs and are responsible for payment in connection with these arrangements revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services

a small portion of our contractual arrangements with clients include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients additional information about our revenue recognition appears in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements

employee sharebased compensation a fair value approach is used in determining the award value of sharebased employee compensation in accordance with codification topic 718 compensation  stock compensation we utilize the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of option awards this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements

pretax sharebased employee compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 was 786 million 593 million and 687 million respectively information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements

fourth quarter 2009 in the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded a net gain of 324 million related to transactions with affiliated companies the net gain was comprised of a 413 million gain resulting from the remeasurement to fair value in accordance with codification topic 805 of our existing ownership interest in an affiliated company in which we acquired a majority stake in december 2009 and was partially offset by impairment charges of 89 million principally related to the loss on the sale of an investment in an affiliated company in january 2010 also in the fourth quarter of 2009 we took a charge of 332 million in connection with the loss in the quarter of a significant client in the automotive sector primarily for severance and lease termination costs salary and service costs for 2009 reflect an increase in severance costs of 154 million related to the client loss office and general expenses for 2009 reflect a decrease of 146 million related to the remeasurement gain of 413 million offset by lease termination costs of 178 million related to the client loss and the impairment charges of 89 million on investments in affiliated companies

revenue our 2009 revenue decreased 123 to 117207 million from 133599 million in 2008 the effect of foreign exchange impacts decreased revenue by 4543 million acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 308 million and organic growth decreased revenue by 11541 million the components of total 2009 revenue changes in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” are summarized below dollars in millions

 the components and percentages are calculated as follows

the foreign exchange impact component shown in the table is calculated by first converting the current period’s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue in this case 121750 million for the total column in the table for the year the foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency in this case 117207 million less 121750 million for the total column in the table for the year

the acquisition component shown in the table is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period

the organic component shown in the table is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth

the percentage change shown in the table of each component is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component in this case 133599 million for the total column in the table for the year

the components of 2009 revenue and revenue change for the full year in our primary geographic markets are summarized and discussed below dollars in millions

 for the full year 2009 foreign exchange impacts decreased our revenue by 4543 million beginning late in the third quarter of 2008 and continuing through the third quarter of 2009 the us dollar strengthened against most other major currencies such as the british pound euro canadian dollar brazilian real and australian dollar

for the fourth quarter of 2009 foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by 1305 million the most significant impacts resulted from the weakening of the us dollar against the british pound euro brazilian real australian dollar and korean won

assuming exchange rates at february 15 2010 remain unchanged we expect foreign exchange impacts to increase our full year 2010 revenue by less than 10

additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2009 was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our single largest client represented 31 and 28 of our

revenue in 2009 and 2008 respectively no other client represented more than 25 of revenue in 2009 or more than 21 of revenue in 2008 our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 178 and 504 of our 2009 revenue respectively and 167 and 474 of our 2008 revenue respectively

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient branding activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives these services include advertising brand consultancy crisis communications custom publishing database management digital and interactive marketing direct marketing entertainment marketing environmental design experiential marketing field marketing financial  corporate businesstobusiness advertising graphic arts healthcare communications instore design investor relations marketing research media planning and buying mobile marketing services multicultural marketing nonprofit marketing organizational communications package design product placement promotional marketing public affairs public relations recruitment communications reputation consulting retail marketing search engine marketing and sports and event marketing in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four disciplines as summarized below traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications

 operating expenses our 2009 operating expenses decreased 13247 million or 114 to 103458 million from 116705 million in 2008 as shown below

 salary and services costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs salary and service costs decreased 11096 million in 2009 compared to 2008 this reflects actions we took to reduce our workforce and contain compensation related costs in the face of reduced client spending salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 721 in 2009 compared to 716 in 2008 principally due to the yearoveryear increase in severance costs of 314 million that included severance costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 154 million related to the loss in the quarter of a client in the automotive sector

office and general expenses represented 183 and 181 of our operating expenses in 2009 and 2008 respectively office and general expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 04 in 2009 compared to 2008 these costs were comprised of office and equipment rents technology costs and depreciation amortization of identifiable intangible assets professional fees and other overhead expenses and were less directly linked to changes in our revenue excluding the net impact of the remeasurement gain lease termination costs and

impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaling 146 million office and general expenses decreased 2005 million in 2009 compared to 2008 this decrease was primarily a result of our cost containment activities

net interest expense our net interest expense increased to 1007 million in 2009 as compared to 743 million in 2008 our gross interest expense decreased by 24 million to 1222 million the decrease in gross interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower borrowings under our credit facility and commercial paper issuances that substantially offset the increased interest resulting from our 625 senior notes issued on july 1 2009 our gross interest income decreased 288 million to 215 million in 2009 this decrease was attributable to lower investment rates and foreign exchange impacts on the interest earned on our foreign cash balances

see “liquidity and capital resources” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters

income taxes our 2009 consolidated effective income tax rate was 340 which is slightly higher than our 2008 rate of 336 the increase in our effective tax rate was caused by higher foreign taxes including a tax expense incurred in 2009 of 129 million due to the resolution of an uncertain tax position for a foreign subsidiary this was substantially offset by a reduction in income tax expense in 2009 of 110 million from the recognition of foreign income tax credits

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” was signed into law the arra provides an election where qualifying cancellation of indebtedness income can be deferred and included in taxable income ratably over the five taxable years beginning in 2014 and ending in 2018 during the first quarter of 2009 we retired 2952 million of our 2031 notes the retirement of the 2031 notes resulted in a tax liability of approximately 73 million during the third quarter of 2009 we retired 4743 million of our 2032 notes the retirement of the 2032 notes resulted in a tax liability of approximately 105 million

in the first quarter of 2009 8412 million of our 2031 notes were put back to us for purchase at par and 2952 million of the 2031 notes were repurchased and retired a partnership that we controlled purchased the remaining 5460 million of the 2031 notes that were put during the fourth quarter of 2009 the partnership was liquidated and the 5460 million of our 2031 notes held by the partnership were permanently retired the retirement of these 2031 notes resulted in a tax liability of approximately 150 million

these liabilities which were previously recorded are included in our balance sheet in our deferred tax liabilities in accordance with arra we expect to pay them during the deferral period beginning in 2014 and through 2018

net income per common share – omnicom group inc for the foregoing reasons our net income – omnicom group inc in 2009 decreased 2073 million or 207 to 7930 million from 10003 million in 2008 diluted net income per common share – omnicom group inc decreased 194 to 253 in 2009 as compared to 314 in the prior year this periodoverperiod decrease was smaller than the decrease in net income – omnicom group inc due to the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding

financial results from operations — 2008 compared with 2007 

 the following analysis gives further details and insight into our 2008 financial performance

revenue our 2008 revenue increased 52 to 133599 million from 126940 million in 2007 the effect of foreign exchange impacts increased revenue by 1639 million acquisitions net of dispositions increased 2008 revenue by 1281 million and organic growth increased revenue by 3739 million the components of total 2008 revenue growth in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” are summarized below dollars in millions

 our fourth quarter 2008 revenue decreased 70 to 33713 million from 36260 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 the effect of foreign exchange impacts decreased revenue by 2107 million acquisitions net of dispositions increased fourth quarter 2008 revenue by 392 million and organic growth decreased revenue by 832 million the components of total fourth quarter 2008 revenue in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” are summarized below dollars in millions

 during the second half of 2008 we experienced a decline in the rate of growth of our revenue compared to the second half of 2007 client spending began to contract in the last half of 2008 and the contraction accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008 the decline was broadbased across all industry segments and geographic areas

the components and percentages are calculated as follows

the foreign exchange impact component shown in the table is calculated by first converting the current period’s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue in this case 131960 million and 35820 million for the total column in the table for the year and quarter respectively the foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency in this case 133599 million less 131960 million and 33713 million less 35820 million for the total column in the table for the year and quarter respectively

the acquisition component shown in the table is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period

the organic component shown in the table is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth

the percentage change shown in the table of each component is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component in this case 126940 million and 36260 million for the total column in the table for the year and quarter respectively

the components of 2008 revenue and revenue growth for the full year in our primary geographic markets are summarized and discussed below dollars in millions

 for the full year 2008 foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by 1639 million the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening especially during the first half of the year of the euro japanese yen and brazilian real against the us dollar which was offset primarily by the decline of the british pound and korean won against the us dollar beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and especially during the last four months of the year the us dollar strengthened against most other major currencies however the foreign exchange impact for the year was still positive

additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2008 was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden

our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our single largest client represented 28 of our revenue in both 2008 and 2007 no other client represented more than 21 of revenue in 2008 or more than 24 of revenue in 2007 our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 167 and 474 of our 2008 revenue respectively and 167 and 462 of our 2007 revenue respectively

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient branding activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives these services include advertising brand consultancy crisis communications custom publishing database management digital and interactive marketing direct marketing directory advertising entertainment marketing environmental design experiential marketing field marketing financial  corporate businesstobusiness advertising graphic arts healthcare communications instore design investor relations marketing research media planning and buying mobile marketing services multicultural marketing nonprofit marketing organizational communications package design product placement promotional marketing public affairs public relations recruitment communications reputation consulting retail marketing search engine marketing and sports and event marketing in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four disciplines as summarized below traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications

 operating expenses our 2008 operating expenses increased 6356 million or 58 to 116705 million from 110349 million in 2007 as shown below

 because we provide professional services salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses salary and service costs were 819 in 2008 and 816 in 2007 these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs salary and service costs accounted for 5520 million of the 6356 million increase in total operating expenses during the first nine months of 2008 salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly compared to the same period in 2007 however given the reduction of revenue that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 we took actions to reduce incentive compensation and our discretionary spending as a result of taking these actions the ratio of salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue for the full year 2008 would have been similar to that of 2007 however we reduced our work force in the fourth quarter of 2008 in anticipation of reductions in client spending in 2009 and we incurred expenses related to severance benefits that were 51 million greater than similar costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of these incremental severance costs

salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased to 716 for the full year of 2008 compared to 710 in 2007

office and general expenses represented 181 and 184 of our operating expenses in 2008 and 2007 respectively these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents technology costs and depreciation amortization of identifiable intangible assets professional fees and other overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue office and general expenses decreased marginally in 2008 from 160 to 158 these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs although they tend to increase as our revenues increase the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues

net interest expense our net interest expense increased slightly by 03 million in 2008 to 743 million as compared to 740 million in 2007 our gross interest expense increased by 177 million to 1246 million the increase was primarily due to higher interest expense on our euro and yen denominated swaps which were terminated in the second half of 2008 and additional interest expense due to an increase in our average debt outstanding partially offset by interest expense savings in 2008 associated with a decrease in the amortization of supplemental interest payments that were made on our zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due 2032 and 2038 “2032 notes” and “2038 notes” in prior periods the total increase in gross interest expense was almost entirely offset by increased interest income earned on our foreign cash balances

in february 2009 we borrowed 8144 million under our credit facility to fund the purchase of our 2031 notes by us and a partnership we controlled borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either a floating base rate or the eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin

income taxes our 2008 consolidated effective income tax rate was 336 which was down slightly from our 2007 rate of 339 primarily due to lower rates in various foreign jurisdictions

income per common share – omnicom group inc for the foregoing reasons our net income – omnicom group inc in 2008 increased 246 million or 25 to 10003 million from 9757 million in 2007 diluted earnings per share – omnicom group inc increased 72 to 314 in 2008 as compared to 293 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of our purchases throughout 2007 and the first eight months of 2008 of treasury shares net of shares issued upon option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements including contractual obligations 

historically substantially all of our nondiscretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement is our working capital in addition as discussed below we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes and convertible notes our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years

our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders payments for new strategic acquisitions capital expenditures and repurchases of our common stock our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow cash on hand and shortterm investments in addition in any given year depending on the level of discretionary activity we may use other sources of available funding such as the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under our credit facility to finance these activities

we have a seasonal working capital cycle working capital requirements are lowest at yearend the fluctuation in working capital requirements between the lowest and highest points during the course of the year can be more than 15 billion this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients including when we place media and incur production costs we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations during the year we manage liquidity through our credit facilities as discussed below under “cash management” at december 31 2009 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 4897 million from december 31 2008 the components of the increase in 2009 are summarized below dollars in millions

sources 

 the principal cash sources and principal discretionary cash uses amounts presented above are nongaap financial measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and certain other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions and borrowings under our credit facility used to fund these working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements

cash management 

we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our whollyowned finance subsidiaries that manage our treasury centers in north america europe and asia each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funding borrow funds from their regional treasury center the treasury centers then aggregate the net position the net position is either invested with or borrowed from third party providers to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to access local currency lines of credit our 25 billion credit facility or depending on market conditions at the time issue up to 15 billion of us dollardenominated commercial paper this enables us to more efficiently manage our debt balances and efficiently utilize our cash as well as better manage our exposure to foreign exchange

our cash and cash equivalents increased by 4897 million and our shortterm investments decreased by 73 million from the prior year shortterm investments include investments of our excess cash which we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle generally within one year the majority of our shortterm investments represent time deposits that mature in 2010

we consider the unrepatriated cumulative earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to be invested indefinitely outside the united states in managing our daytoday liquidity and our longterm capital structure we do not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings determination of the amount of this tax liability is based on the rate differential of the us income taxes in excess of the foreign taxes on any remittances of the undistributed earnings and is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation changes in tax rules may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business in may 2009 several proposals to revise us federal tax laws were announced including a proposal to reduce or eliminate the deferral of us income tax on our unrepatriated earnings to defer tax deductions allocable to nonus earnings until such earnings are repatriated and to change the calculation of the us foreign tax credit it is unclear whether these proposed tax changes will be enacted or if enacted what the scope of the changes will be depending on their content such changes could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position

we manage our net debt position which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and shortterm investments centrally through our treasury centers as discussed above our net debt outstanding at december 31 2009 decreased by 12979 million as compared to the prior yearend as summarized below dollars in millions

 net debt is a nongaap financial measure we believe this presentation together with the comparable us gaap measure is meaningful for understanding our liquidity and it reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with us gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

we maintain a credit facility with a consortium of banks providing borrowing capacity of up to 25 billion as described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements our credit facility provides backup liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us as well as support for our commercial paper issuances depending on market conditions at the time we typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper borrowing under our shortterm uncommitted lines of credit or borrowing on our credit facility during 2009 we issued and redeemed 127 billion of commercial paper and we borrowed and repaid 216 billion under the credit facility the average term of the commercial paper was 52 days and the average borrowing under the credit facility was 124 days at december 31 2009 we had no commercial paper or borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2009 we had shortterm borrowings of 193 million outstanding which are comprised of bank overdrafts by our international subsidiaries these bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the subsidiaries’ bank agreements

our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreements these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda under our credit agreement ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to no more than 30 times in addition we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 50 times at december 31 2009 we were in compliance with these covenants as our ratio of debt to ebitda was 14 times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was 132 times in addition our credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt a moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt credit ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies our outstanding 590 senior notes 625 senior notes convertible notes and bank credit facilities do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facilities however will increase if our longterm debt credit rating is lowered

our whollyowned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc “oci” and omnicom finance inc “ofi” provide funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci and ofi’s assets consist of intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable oci and ofi are coissuers and coobligors of our 590 senior notes 625 senior notes and convertible notes there are no restrictions in the applicable indentures on the ability of oci ofi or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances the 590 senior notes 625 senior notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of us oci and ofi and we unconditionally guarantee the obligations of oci and ofi with respect to the 590 senior notes 625 senior notes and convertible notes

the holders of our 2032 notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in august of each year the holders of our 2033 notes and our 2038 notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on june 15 2010 2013 2018 2023 and on each june 15 annually thereafter through june 15 2037 the 2032 2033 and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios only upon the occurrence of certain events including if our common shares trade above certain levels if we effect extraordinary transactions or in the case of the 2032 notes if our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard  poor’s ratings service or baa3 or lower by moody’s investors service or in the case of the 2033 and 2038 notes to bbb or lower by sp and ba1 or lower by moody’s these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number of

shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes for additional information about the terms of these notes see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

in july 2008 we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of 2500 per 1000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2032 notes as of july 31 2008 and we amended the 2032 notes to eliminate omnicom’s right to redeem the 2032 notes prior to august 2 2010 provided that the noteholders delivered a valid consent to the amendment waived their rights to contingent cash interest payable from october 31 2008 through and including august 1 2010 and agreed not to put their notes back to us substantially all of the noteholders consented to the amendments and all of the 2032 notes remained outstanding noteholders were paid a total supplemental interest payment totaling 181 million that was amortized ratably over a twelve month the period to july 2009

on february 12 2009 we paid a supplemental interest payment of 5000 per 1000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2031 notes approximately 295 million of our 2031 notes were retired and a partnership that financed the purchase of 5460 million of our 2031 notes on our behalf was paid a supplemental interest payment of 273 million and the other noteholders who did not put their notes were paid a supplemental interest payment of 03 million the loan made to the partnership bore interest at 335 per annum on consolidation interest income from the loan to the partnership partly offsets interest expense from the amortization of the supplemental interest payment made to the partnership resulting in net interest expense of 70 million for the year ended december 31 2009

in december 2009 the partnership was liquidated and the remaining 5460 million of our 2031 notes held by the partnership were permanently retired

on august 6 2009 we paid a supplemental interest payment of 76 million to holders of our 2032 notes who did not put their notes back to us a total of 4743 million of our 2032 notes were put back to us for repurchase and a total of 2527 million of our 2032 notes remain outstanding the supplemental interest payment is being amortized ratably over a twelvemonth period to august 2010

as a result of the above we reduced our total debt by 8155 million during 2009 this was funded out of our cash flow from operations looking forward to 2010 we expect to continue to use our cash flow from operations to pay dividends and make capital expenditures as well as to purchase treasury shares and fund acquisitions

our outstanding debt and amounts available under these facilities at december 31 2009 were as follows dollars in millions

 additional information about our indebtedness is included in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

credit markets and availability of credit 

in light of the uncertainty of future economic conditions we continue to seek to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and we will continue to actively manage our discretionary expenditures from august 2008 through december 31 2009 we did not repurchase any significant amount of our common stock beginning in 2010 we plan to resume repurchases of our common stock we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients we believe that these actions in addition to the availability of our 25 billion credit facility are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital needs and our discretionary spending for additional information about our credit facility see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

the next date on which holders of the 2033 notes and 2038 notes may put the notes back to us for cash is june 2010 the next date on which holders of the 2032 notes may put the notes back to us for cash is july 2010 if our convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any put although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event

in funding our daytoday liquidity we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market disruptions in the credit markets beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and continuing into the first part of 2009 led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads during this period to mitigate these conditions and to fund our daytoday liquidity we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit facility in the second half of 2009 we resumed commercial paper issuances

we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any further disruptions in the credit markets

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of our business the following table summarizes information about certain of our obligations at december 31 2009 and should be read together with note 6 debt note 11 income taxes note 15 leases note 18 fair value and note 19 derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements dollars in millions

 our liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities

as more fully described above under the heading “debt instruments guarantees and related covenants” the holders of the convertible notes at december 31 2009 included in the table above have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date as set forth in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 7260 million of convertible notes could be due in less than one year the next date on which holders of our 2033 notes and 2038 notes may put the notes back to us for cash is june 2010 and the next date holders of our 2032 notes may put the notes back to us for cash is july 2010 we have classified our convertible notes as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet because our credit facility does not expire until june 2011 and it is our intention to fund any put with our credit facility

in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ credit worthiness and in many cases requiring credit insurance or payment in advance further in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients however this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn

pension plan funding we maintain two us and twentyseven nonus noncontributory defined benefit pension plans the us plans have been closed to new participants the benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2009 was 1209 million the fair value of assets for these plans at december 31 2009 was 524 million during 2009 we contributed 64 million to our defined benefit pension plans we do not expect our 2010 contributions to increase significantly from 2009

contingent acquisition obligations certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations often referred to as earnouts we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired entity during the

postacquisition transition period these payments are not contingent upon future employment at december 31 2009 the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for acquisitions completed prior to our adoption on january 1 2009 of revisions to us gaap included in codification topic 805 business combinations assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels is approximately 219 million the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in accordance with us gaap prior to the revision to january 1 2009 we have not recorded a liability for these items in our consolidated balance sheets since the definitive amount was not determinable or distributable prior to january 1 2009 actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period changes in the acquired entities’ performance and changes in foreign currency exchange rates these differences could be significant the contingent purchase price obligations as of december 31 2009 calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels are as follows dollars in millions

 in connection with the adoption of the revisions included in codification topic 805 effective january 1 2009 contingent purchase price obligations related to acquisitions completed subsequent to december 31 2008 are recorded as liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and are remeasured at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recorded in our results of operations these liabilities are not included in the above amounts

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in the local currency the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements for the most part our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our results of operations

while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies our major nonus currency markets are the european monetary union emu the united kingdom japan brazil and canada as an integral part of our treasury operations we enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts at december 31 2009 we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of 9007 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany borrowings and investments the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from 5 to 455 days with an average duration under 90 days

in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement we enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge us dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center whose functional currency is the british pound at december 31 2009 we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as we had no commercial paper outstanding

the forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program as a result of these financial instruments we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably in using these contracts we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk to minimize counterparty risk we only enter into these contracts with major wellknown banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating

these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a valueatrisk computation valueatrisk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments the valueatrisk analysis we performed on our december 31 2009 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action if appropriate

interest rate risk substantially all of our longterm debt is fixed rate debt and is not affected by changes in interest rates in managing our daytoday liquidity we may issue commercial paper borrow under our 25 billion credit facility or borrow under our uncommitted lines of credit interest on this debt is variable interest expense on our variable rate debt was approximately 13 million out of our total interest expense of 1222 million for the year ended december 31 2009

our 25 billion credit facility expires on june 23 2011 our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank jpmorgan chase hsbc rbs deutsche bank of america societe generale and bbva we also include large regional banks in the us such as us bancorp northern trust pnc and wells fargo we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as bnp paribas in france sumitomo in japan intesa san paolo in italy scotia in canada and anz in australia

several banks that were in our bank syndicate merged with other global financial institutions additionally during the recent credit crisis several banks in our bank syndicate received capital infusions from their central

governments in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment and the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us

the holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount the next date on which holders of our 2033 notes and 2038 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june 2010 and the next date on which holders of our 2032 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is july 2010 as we have done on prior occasions we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date including our stock price shortterm interest rates and a factor for credit risk

if the remaining outstanding convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event additionally if the convertible notes are put back to us our interest expense will change the extent if any of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced when we refinance the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing

even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollarfordollar basis it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio if we were to replace our convertible notes with interestbearing debt at prevailing rates this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios such as ebitda to interest expense however the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds if either our ratio of debt to ebitda was to double or our ratio of ebitda was to halve we would still be in compliance with these covenants therefore based on our current coverage ratios our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements

credit risk we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 31 of our revenue and no other client accounted for more than 25 of our revenue for 2009 however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change

in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ credit worthiness and in many cases requiring credit insurance or payment in advance further in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients however this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn

 item 1 business 

our business omnicom a strategic holding company was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we are one of the largest advertising marketing and corporate communications companies in the world and we operate in a highly competitive industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented audiences these developments make it increasingly more difficult for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures

our agencies which operate in all major markets around the world provide a comprehensive range of services which we group into four fundamental disciplines traditional media advertising customer relationship management “crm” public relations and specialty communications the services included in these categories are

 although the medium used to reach a given client’s target audience may be different across each of these disciplines we develop and deliver the marketing message in a similar way by providing clientspecific consulting services

our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our companies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to structure our business offerings and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model demands that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it helps to differentiate us from our competition

our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines this means that the delivery of these services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously

further for the longer term we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for advertising and marketing communications services our overarching strategy for our business is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients

the various components of our business and material factors that affected us in 2008 are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” of this report none of our acquisitions in 2008 2007 or 2006 were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations for information concerning our acquisitions see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements

geographic regions and segments our total consolidated revenue is almost evenly divided between us and nonus operations for financial information concerning domestic and foreign operations and segment reporting see our mda and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements

our clients consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy our agencies serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients across a variety of geographic regions and locations our clients participate in virtually all industry sectors of the global economy furthermore in many cases our agencies or networks serve different product groups within the same clients served by other omnicom agencies or networks for example our largest client was served by more than 100 of our agencies in 2008 and represented 28 of our 2008 consolidated revenue no other client accounted for more than 21 of our 2008 consolidated revenue our top 100 clients were each served on average by more than 40 of our agencies in 2008 and collectively represented 472 of our 2008 consolidated revenue

our employees at december 31 2008 we employed approximately 68000 people we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements the skillsets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency see our mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our historical results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the global economic recession could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial condition 

contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit a decrease in consumer and business spending a significant rise in unemployment and other factors have all contributed to a global economic recession to some extent every industry sector in most markets around the world has been adversely affected by the current economic conditions this has led to discretionary reductions in advertising marketing and corporate communications services spending by both our us and international clients and was a contributing factor to the yearoveryear decrease in our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008

we expect that clients’ marketing spending will continue to contract for the near term if the global economic recession continues our clients’ businesses could be adversely affected which would likely lead to reductions in client spending these reductions could adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition

the global credit crisis could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the bursting of the housing bubble and the related mortgage defaults that followed ultimately led to a crisis in the credit markets and a contraction in the availability of credit this crisis has made it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements

a continuation of the credit crisis coupled with a prolonged economic recession could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors including us if that were to occur we could require additional capital to fund the changes in our daytoday working capital requirements there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms if at all this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition

additionally in connection with the global credit crisis several banks in the bank syndicate that supports our 25 billion credit facility received capital infusions from their central governments in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment as a result the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us and we could require additional capital there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms if at all this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position

in a period of severe economic downturn the risk of a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients could significantly increase 

in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor

in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ credit worthiness and in many cases requiring credit insurance or payment in advance further in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers this risk could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

a reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could materially adversely affect our working capital 

working capital is a source of cash as we have historically run a negative working capital cycle during the year this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients including when we place media and incur production costs we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations

the global economic recession could cause a reduction in the volume of client spending or a delay in the time our clients take to pay us which would negatively affect our working capital consequently we could need to obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms if at all such circumstances could therefore materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

companies periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 

the businesses in which we participate are highly competitive key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop creative solutions that meet client needs the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding clients put their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive our revenue may be adversely affected which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we received approximately 47 of our revenue from our 100 largest clients in 2008 and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects business and results of operations and financial condition 

our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns or they could reduce future spending a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel 

our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients’ perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected

in addition we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel our employees are our most important assets our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through regulations or other governmental actions any such limitations on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future

we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad including political instability and exchange controls which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions competition for client assignments and talented staff new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations there are risks of doing business abroad including those of political instability and exchange controls which do not affect domesticfocused firms these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition for financial information on our operations by geographic area see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements

we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 

we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices nationalization social political and economic instability and currency repatriation restrictions among other risks in addition commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague inconsistently administered and retroactively applied if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business our prospects business financial condition and results of operations in those countries could be harmed which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to 12 billion in whole or in part at specified dates in the future 

in july 2009 727 million of our 2032 notes can be put back to us for repurchase in june 2010 our 2033 and 2038 notes aggregating 4675 million can be put to us for repurchase see next paragraph regarding our 2031 notes if we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts we also believe that we will still have capacity under our existing credit commitments sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any put event however in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were to decrease we might need to seek additional funding alternatives there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms if at all

on february 9 2009 holders of 8412 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 notes had put their notes to us for purchase at par we borrowed 8144 million under our credit facility and received 268 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 notes we purchased and retired 2952 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that had been put the partnership formed for the purpose of buying the 2031 notes used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining 5460 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that were put the partnership purchased the 2031 notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit

downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt a moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility however would increase if our longterm debt credit rating is downgraded

additionally our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short or longterm debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies furthermore the 2031 2032 2033 and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios if in the case of the 2031 notes and the 2032 notes our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard  poor’s ratings service or baa3 or lower by moody’s investors service or in the case of the 2033 and 2038 notes to bbb or lower by sp and ba1 or lower by moody’s these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses we believe may be complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the review we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

goodwill may become impaired 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” or “gaap” we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities which principally represents the specialized knowhow of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired we annually test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 item 2 properties 

we maintain office space in many major cities around the world the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and we believe that our facilities are in suitable and wellmaintained condition for our current operations our facilities are primarily used for office and administrative purposes by our employees in performing professional services our principal corporate offices are at 437 madison avenue new york new york and one east weaver street greenwich connecticut we also maintain executive offices in london england shanghai china and tokyo japan

beginning on june 13 2002 several putative class actions were filed against us and certain senior executives in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the actions have since been consolidated under the caption in re omnicom group inc securities litigation  no 02cv4483 rcc on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of our common stock between february 20 2001 and june 11 2002 the consolidated complaint alleges among other things that our public filings and other public statements during that period contained false and misleading statements or omitted to state material information relating to 1 our calculation of the organic growth component of periodtoperiod revenue growth 2 our valuation of and accounting for certain internet investments made by our communicade group “communicade” which we contributed to seneca investments llc “seneca” in 2001 and 3 the existence and amount of certain contingent future obligations in respect of acquisitions the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages plus costs and attorneys’ fees defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and on march 28 2005 the court dismissed portions 1 and 3 of the complaint detailed above the court’s decision denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss the remainder of the complaint did not address the ultimate merits of the case but only the sufficiency of the pleading defendants have answered the complaint discovery concluded in the second quarter of 2007 on april 30 2007 the court granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification certifying the class proposed by plaintiffs in the third quarter of 2007 defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on plaintiff’s remaining claim on january 28 2008 the court granted defendants’ motion in its entirety dismissing all claims and directing the court to close the case on february 4 2008 the plaintiffs filed a notice of intent to appeal that decision to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit the appeal has been fully briefed the parties await a date for oral argument before the court of appeals the defendants continue to believe that the allegations against them are baseless and intend to vigorously oppose plaintiff’s appeal

in addition on june 28 2002 a derivative action was filed on behalf of omnicom in new york state court on february 18 2005 a second shareholder derivative action again purportedly brought on behalf of the company was filed in new york state court the derivative actions have been consolidated before one new york state justice and the plaintiffs have filed an amended consolidated complaint the consolidated derivative complaint questions the business judgment of certain current and former directors of omnicom by challenging among other things the valuation of and accounting for the internet investments made by communicade and the contribution of those investments to seneca the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties of good faith the lawsuit seeks from the directors the amount of profits received from selling omnicom stock and other unspecified damages to be paid to the company as well as costs and attorneys’ fees the defendants moved to dismiss the derivative complaint on the procedural ground that plaintiffs had failed to make a demand on the board on june 27 2006 the trial court entered a decision denying the motion to dismiss the decision did not address the merits of the allegations but rather accepted the allegations as true for the purposes of the motion as the court was required to do and excused plaintiffs from making a demand on the board in the first quarter of 2007 defendants appealed the trial court’s decision on september 25 2007 the new york supreme court appellate division first department issued a decision reversing the trial court and dismissing the derivative claims plaintiffs served defendants with a motion seeking reargument of the appeal or in the alternative permission to appeal the decision to the court of appeals new york’s highest court on january 31 2008 the court denied the plaintiff’s motion we believe the matter is concluded

the defendants in both cases believe that the allegations against them are baseless and intend to vigorously oppose the lawsuits currently we are unable to determine the outcome of these cases and the effect on our financial position or results of operations the outcome of any of these matters is inherently uncertain and may be affected by future events accordingly there can be no assurance as to the ultimate effect of these matters

we are also involved from time to time in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we do not presently expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients while our companies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we structure our business offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client’s specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically either currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base

in recent years certain business trends have affected our business and our industry these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and integrating traditional and nontraditional marketing channels as well as utilizing interactive technologies and new media outlets additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers we believe these trends have benefitted our business in the past and over the long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us

contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit a decrease in consumer spending a significant rise in unemployment and other factors have all led to increasingly volatile capital markets over the course of 2008 during recent months the financial services automotive and other sectors of the global economy have come under increased pressure resulting in among other consequences extraordinarily difficult conditions in the capital and credit markets and a global economic recession that has negatively impacted our clients’ spending on the services that our agencies provide

as one of the world’s leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we operate in all major markets of the global economy we have a large and diverse client base our largest client represented 28 or our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 and no other client accounted for more than 21 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 our top 100 clients accounted for 472 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than 15 of revenue from our 1000 largest clients for the year ended december 31 2008 although our revenues are generally balanced between the us and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base we are not immune to global economic conditions

during the second half of 2008 we experienced a decline in the rate of growth of our revenue compared to the second half of 2007 and due to rapidly changing economic conditions we have less visibility than we historically have had regarding client spending plans in the near term during previous periods of economic downturn our industry experienced slower growth rates and industrywide margin contractions accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2008 in response to reductions in client spending we took action to reduce our salary and service costs by reducing incentive compensation and through actions to limit our discretionary spending additionally in anticipation of reductions in client spending in 2009 we reduced our work force in the fourth quarter of 2008 and we incurred expenses related to severance benefits continued economic uncertainty and reductions in consumer spending may result in further reductions in client spending levels that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we intend to continue to closely monitor economic

conditions client spending and other factors and in response will take actions available to us to reduce costs manage working capital and conserve cash in the current economic environment there can be no assurance as to the effects of future economic circumstances client spending patterns client credit worthiness and other developments on us and whether and to what extent our efforts to respond to them will be effective

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we review are revenue and operating expenses

we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by major geographic location growth by major marketing discipline growth from currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients

in recent years our revenue has been divided almost evenly between domestic and international operations in 2008 our overall revenue growth was 52 of which 13 was related to changes in foreign exchange rates and 10 was related to the acquisition of entities net of entities disposed the remainder 29 was organic growth

in 2008 traditional media advertising represented about 43 of our total revenue and grew by 49 over the prior year crm represented about 38 of the total revenue and grew by 95 over the previous year public relations represented about 95 of the total revenue and decreased by 04 from the prior year and specialty communications represented about 95 of total revenue and decreased by 27 from the prior year

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs technology related costs and depreciation and amortization each of our agencies requires service professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client’s brand and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software

because we are a service business we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs as a percentage of revenue salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue office and general expenses which are not directly related to servicing clients are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than salary and service costs these costs tend to increase as revenue increases however the rate of increase in these expenses could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues during 2008 salary and service costs increased slightly to 716 of revenue versus 710 of revenue in 2007 the increase in salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to recording severance benefits in the fourth quarter of 2008 that were 55 million greater than the amount recorded in the comparable period in 2007 we recorded these severance benefits as a result of reducing our work force in anticipation of reductions in client spending in 2009 office and general expenses decreased slightly during 2008 to 158 of revenue from 160 in 2007

our net income for 2008 increased by 25 to 10003 million from 9757 million in 2007 and our diluted eps increased by 75 to 317 from 295 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year this reduction was the result of our purchases through 2007 and the first eight months of 2008 of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan

critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies 

we have prepared the following summary of our critical accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes including our discussion in note 1 setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail for a more complete understanding of critical accounting policies discussed below

estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a reporting period we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results can differ from those estimates and it is possible that the differences could be material

a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” and when evaluating costmethod investments which consist of ownership interests in nonpublic companies to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred we consider and use several comparable market participant measurements to determine fair value including consideration of similar and recent transactions and when available and as appropriate we use comparative market multiples we also use a discounted expected cash flow methodology numerous estimates and assumptions have to be made when completing a discounted expected cash flow valuation including estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates appropriate discount rates and capital structure additionally estimates must be made regarding revenue growth operating margins tax rates working capital requirements and capital expenditures judgment is required when determining fair value including when we evaluate the applicability of similar and recent transactions and when determining the appropriate comparative market multiples to be used actual results of operations cash flows and other factors used in a discounted expected cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material additional information about impairment testing under sfas 142 and valuation of costmethod investments appears in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements

a fair value approach is used in determining the award value of sharebased employee compensation in accordance with sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” we utilize the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of option awards this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

acquisitions and goodwill we have historically made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in making acquisitions the price we pay is determined by various factors including specialized knowhow reputation competitive position geographic coverage and service offerings as well as our experience and judgment the amount we paid for acquisitions including cash and assumption of net liabilities totaled 4922 million in 2008 and 3783 million in 2007 approximately 36 and 42 respectively of these amounts related to contingent purchase price obligations sometimes referred to as earnouts paid during the respective year related to acquisitions previously completed

a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies is set forth in the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda the amount of contingent purchase price obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies are based on future performance contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2009 are accrued in accordance with gaap when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain

our acquisition strategy has been focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach andor their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly like most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value that we acquire is the knowhow of the people which is treated as part of goodwill and in accordance with sfas no 141 business combinations “sfas 141” is not valued separately for each of our acquisitions we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such assets identified 

the majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets that we acquire is derived from customer relationships including the related customer contracts when making the necessary valuation assumptions of these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the second quarter of the year in accordance with paragraph 30 of sfas 142 we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we then concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in paragraph 17 of sfas no131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information “sfas 131” and the guidance set forth in eitf d101 clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph 30 of fasb statement no 142 consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy and the provision of technology requirements which are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy based on the results of our impairment testing we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their book value and therefore our goodwill was not impaired

additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements

changes in accounting for acquisitions in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas 141 revised 2007 business combinations “sfas 141r” sfas 141r will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is prohibited and sfas 141r will apply to business combinations entered into after january 1 2009 we will adopt sfas 141r on january 1 2009 sfas 141r will require among other things that the acquirer record 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed even when less than 100 of the target is acquired all transaction costs be expensed as incurred and a liability for contingent purchase price obligations earnouts if any be recorded at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value and included in earnings in each subsequent reporting period

revenue recognition substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis and revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured we record revenue net of sales tax use tax and value added tax certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements

these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines – traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications

more specifically in compliance with staff accounting bulletin “sab” 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” as updated by sab 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection is reasonably assured

because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements set forth above apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines

  

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned in certain cases we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and thirdparty production costs and are responsible for their payment recharging our clients for all costs incurred although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that in effect we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue

a small portion of our contractual arrangements with clients include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients additional information about our revenue recognition appears in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements

employee sharebased compensation on january 1 2006 we adopted sfas 123r our outstanding sharebased compensation awards are principally stock options and restricted stock in accordance with sfas 123r because our awards are share settled we record employee sharebased compensation at fair value on the date of grant on january 1 2004 we elected to adopt sfas 123 as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123 “sfas 148” and as provided by sfas 148 we elected to apply it retroactively accordingly our net income for all years presented includes a compensation charge for the grant date fair value of all sharebased compensation awards in the respective year the award was earned

as a result of our election in 2004 to adopt sfas 123 as amended by sfas 148 the adoption of sfas 123r in 2006 did not have a significant effect on our financial statements sfas 123r requires among other things that we record sharebased compensation net of an estimate for awards that are expected to be forfeited on january 1 2006 we recorded an increase to our operating income and net income of 36 million and 20 million respectively as a result of the cumulative effect of this change in accounting for forfeitures however because this adjustment was not significant we did not present it on an aftertax basis as a cumulative effect of an accounting change on our income statement

in estimating the grant date of fair value stock option awards we use certain assumptions and estimates to derive fair value such as expected term rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used the amounts charged to compensation expense would be different however due to limited stock option award activity in the past several years and given that most stock option awards that are outstanding have been fully expensed in our financial statement the impact of using different assumptions and estimates would not be material on our current results of operations

pretax sharebased employee compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 was 593 million 687 million and 711 million respectively information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

additional information regarding the changes required by sfas 123r and its impact on our financial statements can be found in notes 1 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements

new accounting pronouncements 

in addition to those discussed previously additional information regarding new accounting pronouncements can also be found in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements note 1 to our consolidated financial statements also includes a summary of our significant accounting policies

financial results from operations — 2008 compared with 2007 

 the following analysis gives further details and insight into our 2008 financial performance

  revenue when comparing performance between years we discuss nongaap financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes acquisitionsdispositions and organic growth have on reported revenue we derive significant revenue from international operations and yearoveryear changes in foreign currency rates impact our reported results our reported results are also impacted by our acquisition and disposition activity and organic growth accordingly we provide this information to supplement the discussion of changes in revenue periodtoperiod

our 2008 consolidated worldwide revenue increased 52 to 133599 million from 126940 million in 2007 the effect of foreign exchange impacts increased worldwide revenue by 1639 million acquisitions net of dispositions increased 2008 worldwide revenue by 1281 million and organic growth increased worldwide revenue by 3739 million the components of total 2008 revenue growth in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” are summarized below dollars in millions

 our fourth quarter 2008 consolidated worldwide revenue decreased 70 to 33713 million from 36260 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 the effect of foreign exchange impacts decreased worldwide revenue by 2107 million acquisitions net of dispositions increased fourth quarter 2008 worldwide revenue

by 392 million and organic growth decreased worldwide revenue by 832 million the components of total fourth quarter 2008 revenue in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” are summarized below dollars in millions

 during the second half of 2008 we experienced a decline in the rate of growth of our revenue compared to the second half of 2007 and due to the rapidly changing economic conditions we have less visibility than we historically have had regarding client spending plans in the near term client spending began to contract in the last half of 2008 and the contraction accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008 the decline was broadbased across all industry segments and geographic areas continued economic uncertainty and reductions in consumer spending may result in further reductions in client spending levels that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

the components and percentages are calculated as follows

the foreign exchange impact component shown in the table is calculated by first converting the current period’s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue in this case 131960 million and 35820 million for the total column in the table for the year and quarter respectively the foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency in this case 133599 million less 131960 million and 33713 million less 35820 million for the total column in the table for the year and quarter respectively 

the acquisition component shown in the table is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period 

the organic component shown in the table is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth 

the percentage change shown in the table of each component is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component in this case 126940 million and 36260 million for the total column in the table for the year and quarter respectively 

the components of 2008 revenue and revenue growth for the full year and fourth quarter in our primary geographic markets are summarized and discussed below dollars in millions

 for the full year 2008 foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by 1639 million the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening especially during the first half of the year of the euro japanese yen and brazilian real against the us dollar which was offset primarily by the decline of the

british pound and korean won against the us dollar beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and especially during the last four months of the year the us dollar strengthened against most other major currencies however the foreign exchange impact for the year was still positive

for the fourth quarter of 2008 foreign exchange impacts decreased our international revenue by 2107 million the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the us dollar against the british pound euro brazilian real australian dollar and korean won which was offset slightly by the weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen

assuming exchange rates at january 30 2009 remain unchanged we expect foreign exchange impacts to decrease our fullyear 2009 consolidated revenue by between 65 and 75

additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2008 was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our single largest client represented 28 of our worldwide revenue in both 2008 and 2007 no other client represented more than 21 in 2008 or more than 24 in 2007 our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 167 and 474 of our 2008 worldwide revenue respectively and 167 and 462 of our 2007 worldwide revenue respectively

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient branding activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives these services include advertising brand consultancy crisis communications custom publishing database management digital and interactive marketing direct marketing directory advertising entertainment marketing environmental design experiential marketing field marketing financial  corporate businesstobusiness advertising graphic arts healthcare communications instore design investor relations marketing research media planning and buying mobile marketing services multicultural marketing nonprofit marketing organizational communications package design product placement promotional marketing public affairs public relations recruitment communications reputation consulting retail marketing search engine marketing and sports and event marketing in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications

 16

  operating expenses our 2008 worldwide operating expenses increased 6356 million or 58 to 116705 million from 110349 million in 2007 as shown below

 because we provide professional services salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses salary and service costs were 819 in 2008 and 816 in 2007 these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs salary and service costs accounted for 5520 million of the 6356 million increase in total operating expenses during the first nine months of 2008 salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly compared to the same period in 2007 however given the reduction of revenue that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 we took actions to reduce incentive compensation and our discretionary spending as a result of taking these actions the ratio of salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue for the full year 2008 would have been similar to that of 2007 however we reduced our work force in the fourth quarter of 2008 in anticipation of reductions in client spending in 2009 and we incurred expenses related to severance benefits that were 51 million greater than similar costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of these incremental severance costs salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased to 716 for the full year of 2008 compared to 710 in 2007

office and general expenses represented 181 and 184 of our operating expenses in 2008 and 2007 respectively these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents technology costs and depreciation amortization of identifiable intangible assets professional fees and other overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue office and general expenses decreased marginally in 2008 from 160 to 158 these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs although they tend to increase as our revenues increase the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues

  net interest expense our net interest expense increased slightly by 03 million in 2008 to 743 million as compared to 740 million in 2007 our gross interest expense increased by 177 million to 1246 million the increase was primarily due to higher interest expense on our euro and yen denominated swaps which were terminated in the second half of 2008 and additional interest expense due to an increase in our average debt outstanding partially offset by interest expense savings in 2008 associated with a decrease in the amortization in accordance with eitf no 9619 debtor’s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments “eitf 9619” of supplemental interest payments that were made on our zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due 2032 and 2038 “2032 notes” and “2038 notes” in prior periods the total increase in gross interest expense was almost entirely offset by increased interest income earned on our foreign cash balances

in february 2009 we borrowed 8144 million under our credit facility to fund the purchase of our 2031 notes by us and a partnership we control borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either a floating base rate or the eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin as a result we expect our gross interest expense to increase in 2009 additionally assuming exchange rates and interest rates at january 30 2009 remain unchanged we expect interest income earned on our foreign cash balances to decrease in 2009

see “liquidity and capital resources” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters

  income taxes our 2008 consolidated effective income tax rate was 336 which is down slightly from our 2007 rate of 339 primarily due to lower rates in various foreign jurisdictions

  earnings per share eps for the foregoing reasons our net income in 2008 increased 246 million or 25 to 10003 million from 9757 million in 2007 diluted earnings per share increased 75 to 317 in 2008 as compared to 295 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of our purchases throughout 2007 and the first eight months of 2008 of treasury shares net of shares issued upon option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan

our 2007 consolidated worldwide revenue increased 116 to 126940 million from 113769 million in 2006 the effect of foreign exchange impacts increased worldwide revenue by 4368 million acquisitions net of dispositions increased 2007 worldwide revenue by 777 million and organic growth increased worldwide revenue by 8026 million the components of total 2007 revenue growth in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” are summarized below dollars in millions

 the components and percentages are calculated as follows

the foreign exchange impact component shown in the table is calculated by first converting the current period’s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue in this case 122572 million for the total column in the table the foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency in this case 126940 million less 122572 million for the total column in the table 

the acquisition component shown in the table is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period 

the organic component shown in the table is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth 

the percentage change shown in the table of each component is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component in this case 113769 million for the total column in the table 

the components of 2007 revenue and revenue growth compared to 2006 in our primary geographic markets are summarized and discussed below dollars in millions

 as indicated foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by 4368 million for 2007 the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the euro british pound australian dollar and brazilian real against the us dollar which was offset primarily by the decline of the japanese yen against the us dollar additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2007 and historically each year for us as a whole was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our single largest client represented 28 of our worldwide revenue in 2007 and 36 in 2006 no other client represented more than 24 in 2007 or more than 29 in 2006 our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 167 and 462 of our 2007 worldwide revenue respectively and 183 and 462 of our 2006 worldwide revenue respectively

in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications

   operating expenses our 2007 worldwide operating expenses increased 11415 million or 115 to 110349 million from 98934 million in 2006 as shown below

 because we provide professional services salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses during 2007 we continued to invest in our businesses and their professional personnel as a percentage of total operating expenses salary and service costs were 816 in 2007 and 8167 in 2006 these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs most or 9204 million and 806 of the 11415 million increase in total operating expenses in 2007 resulted from increases in salary and service costs this increase was attributable to the increase in our revenue in 2007 and the necessary increases in the direct costs required to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives including direct salaries salary related costs and direct service costs including freelance labor costs and direct administrative costs such as travel as well as increases in incentivebased compensation costs this increase was partially offset by reductions in employee stockbased compensation expense as a result salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue were relatively stable yeartoyear at 711 in 2006 compared to 710 in 2007

office and general expenses represented 184 and 183 of our operating expenses in 2007 and 2006 respectively these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents technology costs and depreciation amortization of identifiable intangible assets professional fees and other overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue office and general expenses increased marginally in 2007 from 159 to 160 but remained flat yearoveryear on a constant currency basis these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs although they tend to increase as our revenues increase the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues

included in office and general expense for 2006 operating margin is a pretax net loss of 05 million arising from the sale in the third quarter of a usbased healthcare business and several small businesses the sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the nondeductibility of goodwill this increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a onetime reduction of income tax expense from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in certain foreign tax laws the aggregate impact of these events was a decrease in profit before tax of 05 million a decrease in tax expense of 18 million and an increase in net income of 13 million

net interest expense our net interest expense in 2007 decreased by 176 million in 2007 to 740 million as compared to 916 million in 2006 our gross interest expense decreased by 180 million to 1069 million the decrease was primarily impacted by interest expense savings associated with the amortization in accordance with eitf no 9619 of supplemental interest payments made with respect to our 2031 and 2032 notes that were made in 2006 but not in 2007 this reduction was offset by 147 million of additional interest costs in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006 related to the issuance in late march 2006 of our 590 senior notes due april 15 2006 “senior notes” during the third quarter of 2007 volatility in the financial markets resulted in an increase in borrowing spreads in the commercial paper markets to mitigate the effect of these increased spreads we arranged for 300 million in unsecured uncommitted lines of credit and shifted funding a portion of our daily needs to these lines from our commercial paper program there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2007 as these lines were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2007

income taxes our 2007 consolidated effective income tax rate was 339 which is up slightly from our 2006 rate of 335 excluding the net reduction in income tax expense in 2006 resulting from the resolution of uncertainties in the third quarter related to changes in certain tax laws that was somewhat offset by a high book tax rate related to dispositions in the third quarter of 2006 the tax rate in 2006 would have been 337 which is more in line with the 2007 rate in connection with our adoption of fin 48 there was no significant change to our effective tax rate in 2007

earnings per share eps for the foregoing reasons our net income in 2007 increased 1117 million or 129 to 9757 million from 8640 million in 2006 diluted earnings per share increased 180 to 295 in 2007 as compared to 250 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of our purchases throughout 2006 and 2007 of treasury shares net of shares issued upon option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan

liquidity and capital resources 

cash sources and requirements including contractual obligations 

historically substantially all of our nondiscretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement is our working capital in addition as discussed below we have contractual obligations related to our debt senior notes and convertible notes our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years

our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders repurchases of our common stock payments for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow cash on hand and shortterm investments in addition in any given year depending on the level of discretionary activity we may use other sources of available funding such as the liquidation of shortterm investments or the issuance of commercial paper to finance these activities

we have a seasonal working capital cycle working capital requirements are lowest at yearend the fluctuation in working capital requirements between the lowest and highest points during the course of the year can be more than 15 billion this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients including when we place media and incur production costs we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations during the year we manage liquidity through our credit facilities as discussed below under “cash management” at december 31 2008 our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 6959 million from december 31 2007 the components of the decrease in 2008 are summarized below dollars in millions

 the principal cash sources and principal discretionary cash uses amounts presented above are nongaap financial measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and certain other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund these working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements

cash management 

we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our whollyowned finance subsidiaries that manage our treasury centers in north america europe and asia each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funding will borrow funds from their regional treasury center the treasury centers then aggregate the net position of the operating companies the net position is either invested with or borrowed from third party providers to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to access local currency lines of credit our 25 billion credit facility or depending on market conditions at the time issue up to 15 billion of us dollardenominated commercial paper this enables us to more efficiently manage our debt balances and effectively utilize our cash as well as better manage our exposure to foreign exchange

our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 6959 million and our shortterm investments decreased by 327 million from the prior year shortterm investments include investments of our excess cash which we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle generally within one year the majority of our shortterm investments represent time deposits that mature in 2009 at december 31 2008 and 2007 our shortterm investments did not include any auction rate securities

we manage our net debt position which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and shortterm investments centrally through our treasury centers as discussed above our net debt outstanding at december 31 2008 increased by 7325 million as compared to the prior yearend as summarized below dollars in millions

 on february 9 2009 holders of 8412 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 notes put their notes to us for purchase at par we borrowed 8144 million under our credit facility and received 268 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 notes we purchased and retired 2952 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that had been put the partnership formed for the purpose of buying the 2031 notes used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining 5460 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that were put the partnership purchased the 2031 notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit the partnership will be consolidated within our financial statements

net debt is a nongaap financial measure we believe this presentation together with the comparable gaap measure is meaningful for understanding our liquidity and it reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with gaap nongaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

we maintain a credit facility with a consortium of banks providing borrowing capacity of up to 25 billion as described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements our credit facility provides backup liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us as well as support for our commercial paper borrowings depending on market conditions at the time we typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper borrowing under our shortterm uncommitted lines of credit or drawing down on our credit facility during 2008 we issued and redeemed 147 billion of commercial paper and we borrowed and repaid 134 billion under the credit facility the average term of the commercial paper was 44 days and the average borrowing under the credit facility was 15 days as of december 31 2008 we had no commercial paper or bank loans outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2008 we had shortterm borrowings of 162 million outstanding which are comprised of bank overdrafts by our international subsidiaries these bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the subsidiaries’ bank agreements

our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreements these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda under our credit agreement ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to no more than 30 times in addition they require us to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 50 times at december 31 2008 we were in compliance with these covenants as our ratio of debt to ebitda was 16 times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was 154 times in addition our credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt a moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt credit ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and bank credit facilities do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facilities however will increase if our longterm debt credit rating is lowered

our whollyowned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc “oci” and omnicom finance inc “ofi” provide funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries oci and ofi’s assets consist of intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable oci and ofi are coissuers and coobligors of our senior notes and convertible notes there are no restrictions in the applicable indentures on the ability of oci ofi or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends loans or advances the senior notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of us oci and ofi and we unconditionally guarantee the obligations of oci and ofi with respect to the senior notes and convertible notes

additional information about our indebtedness is included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements

on february 9 2009 holders of 8412 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 notes put their notes to us for purchase at par we borrowed 8144 million under our credit facility and received 268 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 notes we purchased and retired 2952 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that had been put the partnership formed for the purpose of buying the 2031 notes used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining 5460 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that were put the partnership purchased the 2031 notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit the partnership will be consolidated in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements as amended and fasb interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities and as a result all of the 2031 notes held by the partnership will be eliminated in consolidation

the following table presents our outstanding debt at december 31 2008 after giving effect to the purchase of the 2031 notes and does not reflect any other financing activities that occurred subsequent to december 31 2008 dollars in millions

 credit markets and availability of credit 

in light of the uncertainty of future economic conditions we continue to seek to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and we will continue to actively manage our discretionary expenditures we have not repurchased any of our common stock since august 2008 and we do not plan to resume our repurchases until we believe that the credit markets have begun to stabilize we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients we believe that these actions in addition to the availability of our 25 billion credit facility are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital needs and our discretionary spending for additional information about our credit facility see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements

the next date on which holders of the 2032 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is july 2009 the next date on which holders of the 2033 notes and 2038 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june 2010 if our convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any put although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event

in funding our daytoday liquidity we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market recent disruptions in the credit markets have led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads to mitigate these conditions and to fund our daytoday liquidity through the end of 2008 we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit facility while reducing the volume and the terms of our commercial paper borrowings

we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any further disruptions in the credit markets

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of our business the following table summarizes information about certain of our obligations as of december 31 2008 and should be read together with note 3 debt note 8 income taxes note 11 commitments and contingent liabilities note 12 fair value of financial instruments and note 13 derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements dollars in millions

 our liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities

as more fully described above under the heading “debt instruments guarantees and related covenants” the holders of the convertible notes at december 31 2008 included in the table above have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date as set forth in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 15740 million of convertible notes could be due in less than one year and 4675 million could be due in less than two years the next dates on which holders of the 2031 notes and 2032 notes can put the notes back to us for cash are february 2009 and july 2009 respectively the next date on which holders of the 2033 notes and 2038 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june 2010 we have classified the convertible notes as longterm in our balance sheet because our credit facility does not expire until june 2011 and it is our intention to fund any put with our credit facility

on february 9 2009 holders of 8412 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 notes put their notes to us for purchase at par we borrowed 8144 million under our credit facility and received 268 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 notes we purchased and retired 2952 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that had been put the partnership formed for the purpose of buying the 2031 notes used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining 5460 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that were put the partnership purchased the 2031 notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit

in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ credit worthiness and in many cases requiring credit insurance or payment in advance further in cases where we become committed to the media and it

becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients however this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn

pension plan funding we maintain two us and twentynine nonus noncontributory defined benefit pension plans the benefit obligation for our defined benefit plans was 1342 million at december 31 2008 the fair value of assets for these plans at december 31 2008 was 644 million during 2008 we contributed 59 million to our defined benefit plans we do not expect our 2009 contributions to increase significantly from 2008

contingent acquisition obligations certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations often referred to as earnouts we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired entity during the postacquisition transition period these payments are not contingent upon future employment the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for prior acquisitions assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels is approximately 315 million as of december 31 2008 the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in accordance with us gaap we have not recorded a liability for these items on our balance sheet since the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period changes in the acquired entities’ performance and changes in foreign currency exchange rates these differences could be significant the contingent purchase price obligations as of december 31 2008 calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels are as follows dollars in millions

 contingently redeemable minority interests owners of interests in the common stock of certain of our subsidiaries or affiliates have the right in certain circumstances to require us to purchase additional ownership interests at fair values as defined in the applicable agreements the intent of the parties is to approximate fair value at the time of redemption by using a multiple of earnings which is consistent with generally accepted valuation practices by market participants in our industry

the redemption features are embedded in the shares owned by the minority shareholders and are not freestanding as a result sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity does not apply additionally the embedded redemption features do not fall within the scope of eitf issue no 004 majority owners accounting for a transaction in the shares of a consolidated subsidiary and a derivative indexed to the minority interest in that subsidiary because they do not represent a de facto financing consistent with accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements as amended minority interests have been recorded on the balance sheet at historical cost plus an allocation of subsidiary earnings based on ownership interests less dividends paid to the minority shareholders

historically we have provided a description and an estimate of the redemption features although eitf topic no d98 classification and measurement of redeemable securities “eitf d98” does not specifically address contingently redeemable minority interests we considered applying it by analogy to the redeemable minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries had we applied eitf d98 we would have reported our minority interests at the higher of their carrying value or their redemption fair value through a direct reduction to shareholders’ equity with no impact on earnings further had we applied eitf d98 upon redemption any prior adjustments to accrete minority interests to their redemption value had we recorded them would have been reversed as a direct adjustment to shareholders’ equity with no impact on earnings

assuming that the subsidiaries and affiliates perform over the relevant periods at their current profit levels the aggregate amount we could be required to pay in future periods is approximately 242 million 179 million of which relates to obligations that are currently exercisable if these rights are exercised there would likely be

an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense the ultimate amount payable relating to these transactions will vary because it is primarily dependent on the future results of operations of the subject businesses the timing of the exercise of these rights and changes in foreign currency exchange rates the actual amount that we pay is likely to be different from this estimate and the difference could be significant the redemption value of the obligations that exist for these agreements as of december 31 2008 calculated using the assumptions above are as follows dollars in millions

 as a result of an amendment made to eitf d98 in 2008 we will be required effective january 1 2009 to record an estimate of the redemption fair value of our minority shareholders’ interests of 201 million on our balance sheet through a direct reduction of shareholders’ equity there will be no impact on earnings upon adoption additionally changes in the redemption value will be remeasured through shareholders’ equity in future reporting periods with no impact on earnings




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in the local currency the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for the most part our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our net income

while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies our major nonus currency markets are the european monetary union emu the united kingdom japan brazil and canada as an integral part of our treasury operations we enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts at december 31 2008 we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of 5882 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany borrowings and investments the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from two to 365 days with an average duration under 90 days

in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement we enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge us dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center whose functional currency is the british pound at december 31 2008 we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as there was no commercial paper outstanding additionally during the second half of 2008 we terminated our euro and yen denominated crosscurrency interest rate swaps the effect of terminating our euro and yen denominated swaps on our results of operations was not significant

the forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program as a result of these financial instruments we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably in using these contracts we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk to minimize counterparty risk we only enter into these contracts with major wellknown banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating

these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency

exchange rates and other relevant market risks we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a valueatrisk computation valueatrisk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments the valueatrisk analysis we performed on our december 31 2008 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action if appropriate

debt instruments in march 2006 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due april 15 2016 the gross proceeds from the issuance were 9951 million the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a 605 yield to maturity the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc and two of our whollyowned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc and omnicom finance inc as coobligors the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the coobligors

we maintain a 25 billion credit facility that expires on june 23 2011 we have the ability to classify outstanding borrowings if any under our credit facility as longterm debt

our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank jpmorgan chase hsbc rbs deutsche bank of america societe generale and bbva we also include large regional banks in the us such as us bancorp northern trust pnc and wells fargo we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as bnp paribas in france sumitomo in japan intesa san paolo in italy scotia in canada and anz in australia

recently several banks that were in our bank syndicate merged with other global financial institutions wachovia comprising a 100 million commitment merged with wells fargo wells fargo is a member of our bank syndicate in addition abn amro comprising a 150 million commitment merged with rbs rbs was not a member of our bank syndicate prior to the merger with abn amro additionally in connection with the global credit crisis several banks in our bank syndicate received capital infusions from their central governments in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment and the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us

the holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount at december 31 2008 the next dates on which holders of the 2031 notes and 2032 notes can put the notes back to us for cash are february 2009 and july 2009 respectively the next date on which holders of the 2033 notes and 2038 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june 2010 as we have done on prior occasions we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date including our stock price shortterm interest rates and a factor for credit risk

on february 9 2009 holders of 8412 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 notes put their notes to us for purchase at par we borrowed 8144 million under our credit facility and received 268 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 notes we purchased and retired 2952 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that had been put the partnership formed for the purpose of buying the 2031 notes used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining 5460 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that were put the partnership purchased the 2031 notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit

if the remaining outstanding convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event additionally if the convertible notes are put back to us our

interest expense will change the extent if any of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced when we refinance the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing

even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollarfordollar basis it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio if we were to replace our convertible notes with interestbearing debt at prevailing rates this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios such as ebitda to interest expense however the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds if either our ratio of debt to ebitda increased by 50 or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense decreased by 50 we would still be in compliance with these covenants therefore based on our current coverage ratios our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements

concentration of credit risk we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients due to the diversified nature of our client base we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 28 and no other client accounted for more than 21 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 however during periods of economic downturn the credit profiles of our clients could change

in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers while operating practices vary by country media type and media vendor in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client in other countries we manage our risk in other ways including evaluating and monitoring our clients’ credit worthiness and in many cases requiring credit insurance or payment in advance further in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss including negotiating with media providers we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients however this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn

 item 1 business 

  our business omnicom a strategic holding company was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we are one of the largest advertising marketing and corporate communications companies in the world and we operate in a highly competitive industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums along with their integration within all offerings have effectively fragmented mass audiences these developments make it increasingly more difficult for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures 

our agencies which operate in all major markets around the world provide an extensive range of services which we group into four fundamental disciplines traditional media advertising customer relationship management “crm” public relations and specialty communications the services included in these categories are 

 although the medium used to reach a given client’s target audience may be different across each of these disciplines the marketing message is developed and delivered in a similar way by providing clientspecific consulting services 

our business model was built and evolves around our clients while our companies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to structure our business offerings and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model demands that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute it helps to differentiate us from our competition 

   our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines this means that the delivery of these services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously 

further for the longer term we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for advertising and marketing communications services our overarching strategy for our business is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients 

the various components of our business and material factors that affected us in 2007 are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” of this report none of our acquisitions in 2007 2006 or 2005 were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations for information concerning our acquisitions see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  geographic regions and segments our total consolidated revenue is about evenly divided between us and nonus operations for financial information concerning domestic and foreign operations and segment reporting see our mda and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

  our clients consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy our agencies serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients across a variety of geographic regions and locations our clients participate in virtually all industry sectors of the global economy furthermore in many cases our agencies or networks serve different product groups within the same clients served by other omnicom agencies or networks for example our largest client was served by more than 100 of our agencies in 2007 and represented 28 of our 2007 consolidated revenue no other client accounted for more than 24 of our consolidated 2007 revenue each of our top 100 clients was served on average by more than 40 of our agencies in 2007 and represented 462 of our 2007 consolidated revenue 

  our employees at december 31 2007 we employed approximately 70000 people we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements the skillsets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency see our mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our historical results of operations 

  executive officers of the registrant our executive officers as of february 15 2008 are 

 all of the executive officers have held their present positions at omnicom for at least five years except as specified below

 item 1a risk factors 

companies periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 

the businesses in which we participate are highly competitive key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop creative solutions that meet client needs the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding companies put their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive our revenue may be adversely affected which could then affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel 

our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients’perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to effectively manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 

in addition we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel our employees are our most important assets our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

government agencies and consumer groups have directly or indirectly from time to time affected or attempted to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services whether through regulations or other governmental actions any such limitations on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition there has been an 

   increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices we cannot assure investors that such claims by businesses or governmental agencies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future 

we receive approximately 46 of our revenue from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time for any reason it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns or they could reduce future spending a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be impacted during periods of economic recession 

our business may be adversely affected by downturns in general economic conditions or during periods of economic recession due to potential reductions in client advertising marketing and corporate communications budgets and overall spending levels the effect of a reduction in any of these items could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad including political instability and exchange controls which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions competition for client assignments and talented staff new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations there are some risks of doing business abroad including those of political instability and exchange controls which do not affect domesticfocused firms for financial information on our operations by geographic area see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 

we conduct business in various developing countries around the world the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices nationalization social political and economic instability and currency repatriation restrictions among other risks in addition commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague inconsistently administered and retroactively applied if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business our prospects business financial condition and results of operations in those countries could be harmed which could then have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to 20 billion in whole or in part at specified dates in the future 

if we are required to satisfy a put to repurchase our convertible notes we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the put we also believe that we will still have ample capacity under our existing credit commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any put event however in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were decreased we could experience difficulties in funding our business operations and would have to seek additional funding alternatives as described more fully in our mda furthermore the 2031 2032 2033 and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios if in the case of the 2031 notes and the 2032 notes our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard  poor’s ratings service or baa3 or lower by moody’s investors service or in the case of the 2033 and 2038 notes to bbb or lower by sp and ba1 or lower by moody’s these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 

downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt a moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and our existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility however would increase if our longterm debt credit rating is downgraded additionally our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short or longterm debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies 

   we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses we believe may be complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the review we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

goodwill may become impaired 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” or “gaap” resulting from our acquisition activities which principally represents the specialized knowhow of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired we annually test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in our financial statements that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we maintain office space in many major cities around the world the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and we believe that our facilities are in suitable and wellmaintained condition for our current operations our facilities are primarily used for office and administrative purposes by our employees in performing professional services our principal corporate offices are at 437 madison avenue new york new york and one east weaver street greenwich connecticut we also maintain executive offices in london england shanghai china and tokyo japan 

substantially all of our office space is leased from third parties with varying expiration dates ranging from one to 20 years certain of our leases are subject to rent reviews or contain various escalation clauses and certain of our leases require us to pay various operating expenses which may also be subject to escalation leases are generally denominated in the local currency of the operating entity our consolidated office rent expense was 3847 million in 2007 3519 million in 2006 and 3526 million in 2005 after reduction for rents received from subleases of 224 million 223 million and 235 million respectively 

our obligations for future minimum base rents under terms of noncancelable real estate leases reduced by rents receivable from noncancelable subleases are in millions 

 see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our lease commitments and our mda for the impact of leases on our operating expenses

beginning on june 13 2002 several putative class actions were filed against us and certain senior executives in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the actions have since been consolidated under the caption in re omnicom group inc securities litigation  no 02cv4483 rcc on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of our common stock between february 20 2001 and june 11 2002 the consolidated complaint alleges among other things that our public filings and other public statements during that period contained false and misleading statements or omitted to state material information relating to 1 our calculation of the organic growth component of periodtoperiod revenue growth 2 our valuation of and accounting for certain internet investments made by our communicade group “communicade” which we contributed to seneca investments llc “seneca” in 2001 and 3 the existence and amount of certain contingent future obligations in respect of acquisitions the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages plus costs and attorneys’ fees defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and on march 28 2005 the court dismissed portions 1 and 3 of the complaint detailed above the court’s decision denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss the remainder of the complaint did not address the ultimate merits of the case but only the sufficiency of the pleading defendants have answered the complaint discovery concluded in the second quarter of 2007 on april 30 2007 the court granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification certifying the class proposed by plaintiffs in the third quarter of 2007 defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on plaintiff’s remaining claim on january 28 2008 the court granted defendants’ motion in its entirety dismissing all claims and directing the court to close the case on february 4 2008 the plaintiffs filed a notice of intent to appeal that decision to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 

in addition on june 28 2002 a derivative action was filed on behalf of omnicom in new york state court on february 18 2005 a second shareholder derivative action again purportedly brought on behalf of the company was filed in new york state court the derivative actions have been consolidated before one new york state justice and the plaintiffs have filed an amended consolidated complaint the consolidated derivative complaint questions the business judgment of certain current and former directors of omnicom by challenging among other things the valuation of and accounting for the internet investments made by communicade and the contribution of those investments to seneca the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties of good faith the lawsuit seeks from the directors the amount of profits received from selling omnicom stock and other unspecified damages to be paid to the company as well as costs and attorneys’ fees the defendants moved to dismiss the derivative complaint on the procedural ground that plaintiffs had failed to make a demand on the board on june 27 2006 the trial court entered a decision denying the motion to dismiss the decision did not address the merits of the allegations but rather accepted the allegations as true for the purposes of the motion as the court was required to do and excused plaintiffs from making a demand on the board in the first quarter of 2007 defendants appealed the trial court’s decision on september 25 2007 the new york supreme court appellate division first department issued a decision reversing the trial court and dismissing the derivative claims plaintiffs served defendants with a motion seeking reargument of the appeal or in the alternative for permission to appeal the decision to the court of appeals new york’s highest court on january 31 2008 the court denied the plaintiff’s motion 

the defendants in both cases believe that the allegations against them are baseless and intend to vigorously oppose the lawsuits currently we are unable to determine the outcome of these cases and the effect on our financial position or results of operations the outcome of any of these matters is inherently uncertain and may be affected by future events accordingly there can be no assurance as to the ultimate effect of these matters 

we are also involved from time to time in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we do not presently expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and evolves around our clients while our companies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’ specific requirements should be the central focus in how we structure our business offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client’s specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically either currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 

improving economic conditions in recent years combined with business trends that include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and migrating from traditional marketing channels to nontraditional channels as well as the emergence of new media outlets utilizing interactive technologies have positively affected our business and our industry additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing dollars clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers 

in prior years our industry was negatively affected during periods of economic downturn and geopolitical unrest during these times our industry experienced slower growth rates and industrywide margin contraction however during these periods we continued to invest in our businesses and our personnel and took action to reduce costs at some of our agencies to address these changing economic circumstances although future economic conditions are uncertain as a result of these previous actions our past experience during a slowing economy and the diversification of our businesses geographically and by service offering we believe we can continue to invest in our business if future periods of economic slowdown occur 

the diversity and balance of our portfolio of companies and service offerings have enabled us to continue to grow our revenue operating income net income and earnings per share in the united states revenue grew at a rate of 82 in 2007 which is above our prior year’s rate of 78 on a constant currency basis revenue growth for our international business increased by 72 in 2007 which is a decrease from our prior year’s rate of 79 overall in the past year we believe that our businesses have performed well across our operating regions in addition we expect to continue to increase our investment in the asian market which we believe will grow rapidly in the future we also plan to focus on businesses that will complement and enhance our existing strategic platforms and service capabilities to better serve our clients in various regions 

in 2007 we experienced an increase in our operating margins over the previous year this improvement is the result of our new business initiatives and wins as well as our cost management actions our operating margin for 2007 was 131 compared to 130 in 2006 we will continue our efforts to align our costs with business levels on a locationbylocation basis and pursue a strategy of optimizing our operating margins while maintaining a high level of investment in our people and our businesses 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we review are revenue and operating expenses 

we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by major geographic location growth by major marketing discipline growth from currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients 

   in recent years our revenue has been divided almost evenly between domestic and international operations in 2007 our overall revenue growth was 116 of which 38 was related to changes in foreign exchange rates and 07 was related to the acquisition of entities net of entities disposed the remainder 71 was organic growth 

in 2007 traditional media advertising represented about 43 of the total revenue and grew by 120 over the prior year crm represented about 37 of the total revenue and grew by 141 over the previous year public relations represented about 10 of the total revenue and grew by 111 over the prior year and specialty communications represented about 10 of total revenue and grew by 25 over the prior year 

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs and office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs technology related costs and depreciation and amortization each of our agencies requires service professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client’s brand and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software 

because we are a service business we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs as a percentage of revenue salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue office and general expenses which are not directly related to servicing clients are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than salary and service costs these costs tend to increase as revenue increases however the rate of increase in these expenses could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues during 2007 salary and service costs were relatively stable at 710 of revenue versus 711 of revenue in 2006 this level of expense corresponds with increased revenue levels and the necessary increases in direct salaries salaryrelated costs and freelance labor costs necessary to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives as well as increases in incentivebased compensation costs office and general expenses increased slightly during 2007 to 160 of revenue from 159 in 2006 but remained flat yearoveryear on a constant currency basis 

our net income for 2007 increased by 129 to 9757 million from 8640 million in 2006 and our diluted eps increased by 180 to 295 from 250 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year this reduction was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 

critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies 

we have prepared the following summary of our critical accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements including our discussion in note 1 setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail for a more complete understanding of critical accounting policies discussed below 

  estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a reporting period we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results can differ from those estimates and it is possible that the differences could be material 

   a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under sfas 142 and when evaluating costbased investments which consist of ownership interests in nonpublic companies to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred we consider and use several comparable market participant measurements to determine fair value including consideration of similar and recent transactions and when available and as appropriate we use comparative market multiples we also use a discounted expected cash flow methodology numerous estimates and assumptions have to be made when completing a discounted expected cash flow valuation including estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates appropriate discount rates and capital structure additionally estimates must be made regarding revenue growth operating margins tax rates working capital requirements and capital expenditures judgment is required when determining fair value including when we evaluate the applicability of similar and recent transactions and when determining the appropriate comparative market multiples to be used actual results of operations cash flows and other factors used in a discounted expected cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material additional information about impairment testing under sfas 142 and valuation of costbased investments appears in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements as well as note 6 with respect to our costbased investments 

a fair value approach is used in determining the award value of stockbased employee compensation in accordance with sfas 123r we utilize the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of option awards this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  acquisitions and goodwill we have historically made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in making acquisitions the price we pay is determined by various factors including specialized knowhow reputation competitive position geographic coverage and service offerings as well as our experience and judgment the amount we paid for acquisitions including cash stock and assumption of net liabilities totaled 3783 million in 2007 and 3114 million in 2006 approximately 42 and 51 respectively of these amounts related to contingent purchase price obligations sometimes referred to as earnouts paid during the respective year related to acquisitions previously completed 

a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies is set forth in the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda the amount of contingent purchase price obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies are based on future performance contingent purchase price obligations are accrued in accordance with gaap when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain 

our acquisition strategy has been focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach andor their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly like most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value that we acquire is the knowhow of the people which is treated as part of goodwill and in accordance with sfas no 141 business combinations “sfas 141” is not valued separately for each of our acquisitions we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such assets identified the majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets that we acquire is derived from customer relationships when making the necessary valuation assumptions of these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in accordance with paragraph 30 of sfas 142 we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we then concluded that for each of our 

   operating segments their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in paragraph 17 of sfas no131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information “sfas 131” and the guidance set forth in eitf d101 clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph 30 of fasb statement no 142 consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy and the provision of technology requirements which are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy based on the results of our impairment testing we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their book value and therefore our goodwill was not impaired 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas 141 revised 2007 business combinations “sfas 141r” sfas 141r will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is prohibited and sfas 141r will apply to business combinations entered into after january 1 2009 we will adopt sfas 141r on january 1 2009 sfas 141r will require among other things that the acquirer record 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed even when less than 100 of the target is acquired all transaction costs and expenses be expensed as incurred and a liability for contingent purchase price obligations earnouts if any be recorded at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value and included in earnings in each subsequent reporting period 

additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  revenue recognition substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis and revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured we record revenue net of sales tax use tax and value added tax certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements 

these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines – traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications 

more specifically in compliance with staff accounting bulletin “sab” 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” as updated by sab 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement and collection is reasonably assured 

because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements set forth above apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned in certain cases we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and thirdparty production costs and are responsible for their payment recharging our clients for all costs incurred although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that in effect we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue 

a small portion of our contractual arrangements with clients include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients additional information about our revenue recognition appears in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

     employee stockbased compensation on january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” our outstanding stockbased compensation awards are principally stock options and restricted stock in accordance with sfas 123r because our awards are share settled we record employee stockbased compensation at fair value on the date of grant on january 1 2004 we had elected to adopt sfas 123 as amended by sfas 148 and as provided by sfas 148 we elected to apply it retroactively accordingly our net income for all years presented includes a compensation charge for the grant date fair value of all stockbased compensation awards in the respective year the award was earned 

as a result of our election in 2004 to adopt sfas 123 as amended by sfas 148 the adoption of sfas 123r in 2006 did not have a significant effect on our financial statements sfas 123r requires among other things that we record stockbased compensation net of an estimate for awards that are expected to be forfeited on january 1 2006 we recorded an increase to our operating income and net income of 36 million and 20 million respectively as a result of the cumulative effect of this change in accounting for forfeitures however because this adjustment was not significant we did not present it on an aftertax basis as a cumulative effect of an accounting change on our income statement 

in estimating the grant date of fair value stock option awards we use certain assumptions and estimates to derive fair value such as expected term rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used the amounts charged to compensation expense would be different however due to limited stock option award activity in the past several years and given that most stock option awards that are outstanding have been fully expensed in our financial statement the impact of using different assumptions and estimates would not be material on our current results of operations 

pretax stockbased employee compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was 687 million 711 million and 870 million respectively information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

additional information regarding the changes required by sfas 123r and its impact on our financial statements can be found in note 1 and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting pronouncements 

in addition to those discussed previously additional information regarding new accounting pronouncements can also be found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements note 1 to our consolidated financial statements also includes a summary of our significant accounting policies 

   financial results from operations — 2007 compared with 2006 

 the following yearoveryear analysis gives further details and insight into the changes in our financial performance 

  revenue when comparing performance between years we discuss nongaap financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes acquisitionsdispositions and organic growth have on reported revenue we derive significant revenue from international operations and changes in foreign currency rates between the years impact our reported results our reported results are also impacted by our acquisition and disposition activity and organic growth accordingly we provide this information to supplement the discussion of changes in revenue periodtoperiod 

our 2007 consolidated worldwide revenue increased 116 to 126940 million from 113769 million in 2006 the effect of foreign exchange impacts increased worldwide revenue by 4368 million acquisitions net of dispositions increased 2007 worldwide revenue by 777 million and organic growth increased worldwide revenue by 8026 million the components of total 2007 revenue growth in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” are summarized below dollars in millions 

 the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

       the components of 2007 revenue and revenue growth compared to 2006 in our primary geographic markets are summarized and discussed below dollars in millions 

 as indicated foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by 4368 million for 2007 the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the euro british pound australian dollar and brazilian real against the us dollar which was offset primarily by the decline of the japanese yen against the us dollar assuming exchange rates at january 31 2008 remain unchanged we expect foreign exchange impacts to increase our fullyear 2008 consolidated revenue by between 15 and 25 additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2007 and historically each year for us as a whole was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our single largest client represented 28 of our worldwide revenue in 2007 and 36 in 2006 no other client represented more than 24 in 2007 or more than 29 in 2006 our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 167 and 462 of our 2007 worldwide revenue respectively and 183 and 462 of our 2006 worldwide revenue respectively 

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient branding activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives these services include advertising brand consultancy crisis communications custom publishing database management digital and interactive marketing direct marketing directory advertising entertainment marketing environmental design experiential marketing field marketing financial  corporate businesstobusiness advertising graphic arts healthcare communications instore design investor relations marketing research media planning and buying mobile marketing services multicultural marketing nonprofit marketing organizational communications package design product placement promotional marketing public affairs public relations recruitment communications reputation consulting retail marketing search engine marketing and sports and event marketing in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications 

      operating expenses our 2007 worldwide operating expenses increased 11415 million or 115 to 110349 million from 98934 million in 2006 as shown below 

 because we provide professional services salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses during 2007 we continued to invest in our businesses and their professional personnel as a percentage of total operating expenses salary and service costs were 816 in 2007 and 817 in 2006 these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs most or 9204 million and 806 of the 11415 million increase in total operating expenses in 2007 resulted from increases in salary and service costs this increase was attributable to the increase in our revenue in 2007 and the necessary increases in the direct costs required to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives including direct salaries salary related costs and direct service costs including freelance labor costs and direct administrative costs such as travel as well as increases in incentivebased compensation costs this increase was partially offset by reductions in employee stockbased compensation expense as a result salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue were relatively stable yeartoyear at 711 in 2006 compared to 710 in 2007 

office and general expenses represented 184 and 183 of our operating expenses in 2007 and 2006 respectively these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents technology costs and depreciation amortization of identifiable intangible assets professional fees and other overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue office and general expenses increased marginally in 2007 from 159 to 160 but remained flat yearoveryear on a constant currency basis these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs although they tend to increase as our revenues increase the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues 

we expect we will continue our efforts to align our costs with business levels on a locationbylocation basis and pursue a strategy of optimizing our operating margins and maintaining a high level of investment in our people and our businesses as we look for ways to increase the variability of our cost structure 

included in office and general expense for 2006 operating margin is a pretax net loss of 05 million arising from the sale in the third quarter of a usbased healthcare business and several small businesses the sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the nondeductibility of goodwill this increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a onetime reduction of income tax expense from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in certain foreign tax laws the aggregate impact of these events was a decrease in profit before tax of 05 million a decrease in tax expense of 18 million and an increase in net income of 13 million 

     net interest expense our net interest expense decreased by 176 million in 2007 to 740 million as compared to 916 million in 2006 our gross interest expense decreased by 180 million to 1069 million the decrease was primarily impacted by interest expense savings associated with the amortization in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” no 9619 debtor’s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments “eitf 9619” of supplemental interest payments made with respect to our 2031 and 2032 notes that were made in 2006 but not in 2007 this reduction was offset by 147 million of additional interest costs in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006 related to the issuance in late march 2006 of our 590 senior notes due april 15 2006 “senior notes” during the third quarter of 2007 volatility in the financial markets resulted in an increase in borrowing spreads in the commercial paper markets to mitigate the effect of these increased spreads we arranged for 300 million in unsecured uncommitted lines of credit and shifted funding a portion of our daily needs to these lines from our commercial paper program there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31 2007 as these lines were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2007 

in february 2008 we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of 900 per 1000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2031 notes as of february 4 2008 who did not put their notes back to us none of the 2031 notes were put back to us and on february 8 2008 noteholders were paid a total supplemental interest payment of 76 million that will be amortized ratably over a 12month period to the next put date in accordance with eitf 9619 because we made a supplemental interest payment on our 2031 notes in 2008 but we did not make a similar interest payment in 2007 interest expense will increase by 70 million in 2008 

see “liquidity and capital resources” for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters 

  income taxes our 2007 consolidated effective income tax rate was 339 which is up slightly from our 2006 rate of 335 excluding the net reduction in income tax expense in 2006 resulting from the resolution of uncertainties in the third quarter related to changes in certain tax laws that was somewhat offset by a high book tax rate related to dispositions in the third quarter of 2006 the tax rate in 2006 would have been 337 which is more in line with the 2007 rate in connection with our adoption of fin 48 there was no significant change to our effective tax rate in 2007 

  earnings per share eps for the foregoing reasons our net income in 2007 increased 1117 million or 129 to 9757 million from 8640 million in 2006 diluted earnings per share increased 180 to 295 in 2007 as compared to 250 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of our purchases throughout 2006 and 2007 of treasury shares net of shares issued upon option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan

 the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

       the components of 2006 revenue and revenue growth compared to 2005 in our primary geographic markets are summarized and discussed below dollars in millions 

 as indicated foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by 723 million for 2006 the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the canadian dollar british pound euro and brazilian real against the us dollar which was offset primarily by the decline of the japanese yen against the us dollar based on exchange rates at january 31 2007 we expect foreign exchange impacts to increase our fullyear 2007 consolidated revenue by between 10 and 15 additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements

in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications 

      operating expenses our 2006 worldwide operating expenses increased 7521 million or 82 to 98934 million from 91413 million in 2005 as shown below 

 because we provide professional services salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses during 2006 we continued to invest in our businesses and their professional personnel as a percentage of total operating expenses salary and service costs were 817 in 2006 and 811 in 2005 these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs most or 6749 million and 897 of the 7521 million increase in total operating expenses in 2006 resulted from increases in salary and service costs this increase was attributable to the increase in our revenue in 2006 and the necessary increases in the direct costs required to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives including direct salaries salary related costs and direct service costs including freelance labor costs and direct administrative costs such as travel as well as increases in incentivebased compensation costs this increase was partially offset by reductions in severance and employee stockbased compensation expense as a result salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased yeartoyear from 707 in 2005 to 711 in 2006 

office and general expenses represented 183 and 189 of our operating expenses in 2006 and 2005 respectively these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents technology costs and depreciation amortization of identifiable intangible assets professional fees and other overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue office and general expenses decreased in 2006 from 165 to 159 as a result of continuing efforts to better align these costs with business levels on a locationbylocation basis these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs although they tend to increase as our revenues increase the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues 

included in office and general expense for 2006 operating margin is a pretax net loss of 05 million arising from the sale in the third quarter of a usbased healthcare business and several small businesses the sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the nondeductibility of goodwill this increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a onetime reduction of income tax expense from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in certain foreign tax laws the aggregate impact of these events was a decrease in profit before tax of 05 million a decrease in tax expense of 18 million and an increase in net income of 13 million excluding the net loss of 05 million our 2006 operating margin was unchanged 

included in office and general expense for 2005 is a pretax net gain of 69 million arising from the sale in the first quarter of a majorityowned business located in australia and new zealand and the disposal of a nonstrategic business located in the united states due to the unusually high book tax rate caused by the nondeductibility of goodwill the book tax cost of the transactions was 61 million after deducting minority interest expense the impact of these transactions increased net income in 2005 by 04 million excluding the net gain of 69 million from investment activity office and general expenses were 166 of revenue in 2005 

  net interest expense our net interest expense increased in 2006 to 916 million as compared to 592 million in 2005 our gross interest expense increased by 469 million to 1249 million this increase was primarily impacted by 455 million of additional interest costs related to the issuance of our 590 senior notes due april 15 2016 “senior notes” and 239 million of additional interest costs associated with the 

   amortization in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” no 9619 debtor’s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments “eitf 9619” of supplemental interest payments made with respect to our liquid yield option notes due 2031 “2031 notes” 

these increases were partially offset by interest expense savings relative to the redemption at maturity in june 2005 of our eurodenominated “€” 1524 million 520 notes as well as interest expense savings under our commercial paper program compared to the prior year the increase in interest income is the result of increased levels of cash and shortterm investments on hand during the year as well as increases in shortterm interest rates 

see “liquidity and capital resources” for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters 

  income taxes  our 2006 consolidated effective income tax rate was 335 which is lower than our 2005 rate of 340 the 335 tax rate for 2006 was impacted by the following activity during the third quarter of 2006 we disposed of a usbased healthcare business and several small businesses as described above the sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the allocation of nondeductible goodwill in accordance with sfas 142 this increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a onetime reduction of income tax expense resulting from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in foreign tax laws excluding this activity our tax rate for 2006 would have been 337 the 340 tax rate for 2005 was also high as it was impacted by the sale in the first quarter of 2005 of a majorityowned business in australia and new zealand that resulted in a gain and an unusually high book tax rate on that gain excluding the effect of the gain and the related tax impact our 2005 tax rate would also have been 337 

  earnings per share eps for the foregoing reasons our net income in 2006 increased 733 million or 93 to 8640 million from 7907 million in 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 147 to 250 in 2006 as compared to 218 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year this reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of shares issued upon option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan a substantial portion of our treasury share repurchases were made in connection with an accelerated share repurchase “asr” program described in our liquidity and capital resource discussion 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements including contractual obligations 

historically substantially all of our nondiscretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement is our working capital in addition as discussed below we have contractual obligations related to our debt senior notes and convertible notes our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years 

our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders repurchases of our common stock payments for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow cash on hand and shortterm investments in addition in any given year depending on the level of discretionary activity we may use other sources of available funding such as the liquidation of shortterm investments or the issuance of commercial paper to finance these activities 

we have a seasonal working capital cycle working capital requirements are lowest at yearend the fluctuation in working capital requirements between the lowest and highest points during the course of the year can be more than 15 billion this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients including when we place media and incur production costs we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations during the year we manage liquidity 

   through our credit facilities as discussed below under “cash management” at december 31 2007 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 537 million from december 31 2006 the components of the increase in 2007 are summarized below dollars in millions 

 the principal cash sources and principal discretionary cash uses numbers presented above are nongaap financial measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and certain other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund these working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

  contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of our business the following table summarizes information about certain of our obligations as of december 31 2007 and should be read together with note 3 bank loans and lines of credit note 4 longterm debt and convertible notes note 8 income taxes note 10 commitments and contingent liabilities note 11 fair value of financial instruments and note 12 financial instruments and market risk to our consolidated financial statements 

 as more fully described below under the heading “debt instruments guarantees and related covenants” the holders of the convertible notes included in the table above have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date as set forth in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 20415 million of convertible notes could be due in less than one year 

   our liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 

 as discussed above in the normal course of business our agencies enter into various contractual media commitments on behalf of our clients at levels substantially exceeding our revenue these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the providers historically we have not experienced significant losses for media commitments entered into on behalf of our clients and we believe that we do not have substantial exposure to potential losses of this nature in the future as we monitor closely the credit worthiness of our clients in the event that we are committed to the media services and our client has not paid us we believe that the risk of material loss is minimal because in the normal course of business we have reasonable options available to us to substantially mitigate potential losses 

  contingent acquisition obligations certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations often referred to as earnouts we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired entity during the postacquisition transition period these payments are not contingent upon future employment the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for prior acquisitions assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels is approximately 378 million as of december 31 2007 the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in accordance with us gaap we have not recorded a liability for these items on our balance sheet since the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period changes in the acquired entities’ performance and changes in foreign currency exchange rates these differences could be significant the contingent purchase price obligations as of december 31 2007 calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels are as follows 

 in addition owners of interests in certain of our subsidiaries or affiliates have the right in certain circumstances to require us to purchase additional ownership interests in those companies assuming that the subsidiaries and affiliates perform over the relevant periods at their current profit levels the aggregate amount we could be required to pay in future periods is approximately 314 million 208 million of which relates to obligations that are currently exercisable if these rights are exercised there would likely be an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense the ultimate amount payable relating to these transactions will vary because it is primarily dependent on the future results of operations of the subject businesses the timing of the exercise of these rights and changes in foreign currency exchange rates the actual amount that we pay is likely to be different from this estimate and the difference could be significant the obligations that exist for these agreements as of december 31 2007 calculated using the assumptions above are as follows 

    sources and uses of cash 

our cash requirements have historically been funded by a combination of our operating cash flow and cash on hand as well as points in time when we have opportunistically accessed the capital markets our capital market transactions have included issuing 10 billion in tenyear fixed rate notes senior notes in 2006 and convertible notes in an aggregate principle amount of 6000 million 9000 million and 8500 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of our shares and the repayment of maturing debt on march 31 2006 we entered into an agreement to purchase 110 million shares of our outstanding common stock for 4587 million we repurchased the shares under an accelerated share repurchase “asr” program with a financial institution at 41705 per share with an initial settlement date of april 3 2006 the purchase was funded using a portion of the proceeds from our senior notes offering during the second quarter of 2006 the financial institution purchased the 110 million shares of our common stock in the open market and we paid a settlement amount of 451 million referred to as the purchase price adjustment based upon the difference between the actual cost of the shares purchased by the financial institution of 45805 per share and the initial purchase price of 41705 per share 

at december 31 2007 we had 17932 million in cash and cash equivalents in addition we had 25 billion in unused committed credit facilities available for immediate use to fund our cash needs these credit facilities are more fully described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

our operating cash flow and access to the capital markets could be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control additionally access to the capital markets could be impaired by adverse changes to the short and longterm debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies 

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt a moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt credit ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and bank credit facilities do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facilities however will increase if our longterm debt credit rating is lowered 

as described in note 3 our committed bank facilities contain two financial covenants relating to cash flow and interest coverage which we met by a significant margin as of december 31 2007 

we believe that our current financial condition provides us with the ability to readily access the capital markets also our cash balances combined with our liquidity of shortterm investments operational cash flows and unused committed borrowing capacity are sufficient to support our foreseeable cash requirements arising from working capital outstanding debt capital expenditures dividends acquisitions and stock repurchases 

cash management 

we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through treasury centers in north america and europe each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funding will borrow funds from their regional treasury center the treasury centers then aggregate the net position of the operating companies the net position is either invested with or borrowed from third party providers to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to access local currency lines of credit our 25000 million committed bank facilities or issue up to 15000 million of us dollardenominated commercial paper this enables us to reduce our consolidated debt levels and minimize interest expense as well as centrally manage our exposure to foreign exchange 

our cash and cash equivalents increased by 537 million and our shortterm investments decreased by 1415 million from the prior year shortterm investments include investments of our excess cash which we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle generally within one year the majority of our shortterm investments represent time deposits that mature in 2008 at december 31 2007 our shortterm investments did not include any auction rate securities 

   we manage our net debt position which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and shortterm investments centrally through our treasury centers as discussed above our net debt outstanding at december 31 2007 increased by 908 million as compared to the prior yearend as summarized below dollars in millions 

 net debt is a nongaap financial measure we believe this presentation is meaningful for understanding our net debt position and it reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management 

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

we maintain a credit facility with a consortium of banks providing borrowing capacity of up to 2500 million as described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements this credit facility is available to provide credit support for issuances under our 15000 million commercial paper program as well as to provide backup liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us we typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper or by borrowing under our shortterm uncommitted lines of credit occasionally we may draw down on our credit facility during 2007 we issued and redeemed 200 billion of commercial paper the average term of the commercial paper was 32 days as of december 31 2007 we had no commercial paper or bank loans outstanding under these credit facilities at december 31 2007 we had shortterm bank loans of 120 million outstanding which are comprised of bank overdrafts by our international subsidiaries these bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the subsidiaries’ bank agreements 

our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreements these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda for these purposes ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to no more than 30 times in addition they require us to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 50 times at december 31 2007 we were in compliance with these covenants as our ratio of debt to ebitda was 16 times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was 175 times 

in march 2006 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 590 senior notes due april 15 2016 the gross proceeds from the issuance were 9951 million the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a 605 yield to maturity the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc and two of our wholly owned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc and omnicom finance inc as coobligors similar to our convertible notes the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the coobligors 

at december 31 2007 we had a total of 20415 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding including 8470 million 2031 notes that were issued in february 2001 7270 million 2032 notes that were issued in march 2002 02 million zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due 2033 that were issued in june 2003 and 4673 million zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due 2038 “2038 notes” that were originally issued in june 2003 as 2033 notes that were subsequently amended in june 2006 to become the 2038 notes 

   the holders of our 2031 notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in february of each year the holders of our 2032 notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in august of each year the holders of our 2038 notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on june 15 2008 2010 2013 2018 2023 and on each june 15 annually thereafter through june 15 2037 the 2031 2032 2033 and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios only upon the occurrence of certain events including if our common shares trade above certain levels if we effect extraordinary transactions or in the case of the 2031 notes and the 2032 notes if our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard  poor’s ratings service or baa3 or lower by moody’s investors service or in the case of the 2033 and 2038 notes to bbb or lower by sp and ba1 or lower by moody’s these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes for additional information about the terms of these notes see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

in august 2005 we paid a supplemental interest payment of 335 million to qualified noteholders of our 2032 notes equal to 3750 per 1000 principal amount of notes that did not put their notes back to us the total supplemental interest payment was amortized ratably over a 12month period to the next put date ending in august 2006 in accordance with eitf 9619 

in february 2006 we paid a supplemental interest payment of 392 million to qualified noteholders of our 2031 notes that did not put their notes back to us the total supplemental interest payment was amortized ratably over a 12month period to the next put date in february 2007 in accordance with eitf 9619 

in june 2006 we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of 2750 per 1000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2033 notes that did not put their notes back to us and consented to the amendments to the notes and related indenture as of june 27 2006 the principal amendment extended the maturity of the notes from june 15 2033 to july 1 2038 the additional amendments conformed other terms of the notes for the extension of the maturity date as well as amending the comparable yield on june 21 2006 we repurchased 1325 million of 2033 notes that were put to us with respect to the remaining 4675 million of 2033 notes as of june 30 2006 noteholders holding a combined amount of 4281 million consented to the amendments were paid 2750 per 1000 note and their notes were amended the total supplemental interest payment of 117 million is being amortized ratably over a 24month period to the next put date in accordance with eitf 9619 the remaining noteholders of the 2033 notes comprising 394 million aggregate principal amount of notes did not consent to the amendments and were not paid the supplemental interest payment during 2007 substantially all of the remaining holders of the 2033 notes exchanged their 2033 notes for 2038 notes reducing the aggregate principal amount of our 2033 notes to 02 million no supplemental interest payment or fee was paid to noteholders for this exchange 

in july 2006 we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of 3250 per 1000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2032 notes as of august 1 2006 that did not put their notes back to us on august 4 2006 we repurchased 1652 million of our 2032 notes that were put to us with respect to the remaining 7270 million of notes noteholders were paid a total supplemental interest payment of 236 million on august 2 2006 which was amortized ratably over a 12month period to the next put date in accordance with eitf 9619 

in february 2007 we did not pay a supplemental interest payment to qualified noteholders of our 2031 notes additionally none of the 2031 notes were put back to us for repayment 

in july 2007 we did not pay a supplemental interest payment to qualified noteholders of our 2032 notes additionally none of the 2032 notes were put back to us for repayment 

in february 2008 we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of 900 per 1000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2031 notes as of february 4 2008 who did not put their notes back to us none of the 2031 notes were put back to us and on february 8 2008 noteholders were paid a total supplemental interest payment of 76 million that will be amortized ratably over a 12month period to the next put date in accordance with eitf 9619 

   our outstanding debt and amounts available under these facilities as of december 31 2007 dollars in millions were as follows 

 additional information about our indebtedness is included in notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in the local currency the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 12 of our consolidated financial statements for the most part our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our net income 

while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies our major nonus currency markets are the european monetary union emu the united kingdom japan brazil and canada as an integral part of our treasury operations we enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts at december 31 2007 we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of 2469 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany borrowings and investments the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from two to 365 days with an average duration of just over 100 days 

in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement we enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge us dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center whose functional currency is the british pound at december 31 2007 we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as there was no commercial paper outstanding 

additionally at december 31 2007 we had crosscurrency interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional principal amount of €2300 million euro maturing in 2010 and japanese yenbased crosscurrency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of japanese yen 220 billion maturing in 2013 see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the fair value of each type of derivative instrument 

the forward foreign exchange and swap contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program as a result of these financial instruments we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably in using these contracts we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk to minimize counterparty risk we only enter into these contracts with major wellknown banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating 

   these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a valueatrisk computation valueatrisk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments the valueatrisk analysis we performed on our december 31 2007 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action if appropriate 

  debt instruments in march 2006 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due april 15 2016 the gross proceeds from the issuance were 9951 million the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a 605 yield to maturity the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc and two of our whollyowned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc and omnicom finance inc as coobligors similar to our convertible notes the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the coobligors 

in june 2006 we amended and extended our fiveyear credit facility to june 23 2011 and increased the amount available from 21 billion to 24 billion with substantially the same bank consortium in conjunction with this amendment and extension we terminated our 4000 million 364day revolving credit facility that was due to expire subsequently in september 2006 the facility was increased from 24 billion to 25 billion we have the ability to classify outstanding borrowings if any under our fiveyear credit facility as longterm debt 

in funding our daytoday liquidity we are an active participant in the commercial paper market with a 15 billion program as of december 31 2007 we had no commercial paper outstanding our credit facility provides credit support for commercial paper as well as providing backup liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us 

our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank jpmorgan chase hsbc abn amro deutsche bank of america societe generale and bbva we also include large regional banks in the us such as wachovia us bancorp northern trust pnc and wells fargo we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as sumitomo in japan fortis in belgium intesa san paolo in italy scotia in canada and anz in australia 

our other longterm debt consists principally of convertible notes as previously discussed the holders of these convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date including our stock price shortterm interest rates and a factor for credit risk 

if the convertible notes are put back to us our interest expense could increase the extent if any of the increase in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced when we refinance the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the instrument 

supplemental interest payments such as those made in 2005 and 2006 to qualified noteholders as described above under “debt instruments guarantees and related covenants” are one method of keeping the convertible notes outstanding if we are required to satisfy a put based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any put while still preserving ample capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event 

our credit commitments allow either the issuance of commercial paper or bank loans and we would likely fund the put initially using some combination of these instruments we would then evaluate all funding alternatives available to us to replenish our credit capacity and liquidity we believe the funding alternatives would include substantially all forms of debt equity and convertible instruments available to us by accessing the public or private capital markets our evaluation would likely include the expected cash flows from the normal course of our business operations and the credit capacity to fund additional potential puts on the remaining outstanding convertible notes 

   currently we meet all of our debt covenant requirements our credit facilities contain financial covenants limiting the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda for purposes of these covenants ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to no more than 30 times at december 31 2007 our ratio of debt to ebitda was 16 times in addition we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 50 times at december 31 2007 our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was 175 times we were in compliance with these covenants in addition the credit facilities do not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends 

even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollarfordollar basis it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio if we were to replace our convertible notes with interestbearing debt at prevailing rates this potential increase in interest expense would negatively impact our coverage ratios such as ebitda to interest expense however the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds if either our ratio of debt to ebitda increased by 50 or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense decreased by 50 we would still be in compliance with these covenants therefore based on our current coverage ratios our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements thus we do not expect any negative impact on our credit ratings if the convertible notes are put to us 

  credit markets during the third quarter of 2007 volatility in the financial markets resulted in an increase in borrowing spreads in the commercial paper market to mitigate the effect of these increased spreads we arranged for 3000 million in unsecured uncommitted lines of credit and shifted the funding of a portion of our daily borrowing needs to these lines from our commercial paper program at december 31 2007 there were no borrowings outstanding under these unsecured uncommitted lines of credit as these lines were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2007 at december 31 2007 the volatility in the credit markets did not have any impact on our debt instruments and credit ratings

   part iv 



















 item 1 business 

  our business omnicom a strategic holding company was formed in 1986 by the merger of several leading advertising marketing and corporate communications companies we are one of the largest advertising marketing and corporate communications companies in the world the proliferation of media channels especially print and cable television and recently the internet has effectively fragmented mass audiences these developments make it increasingly more difficult for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures 

our agencies provide an extensive range of services which we group into four fundamental disciplines traditional media advertising customer relationship management “crm” public relations and specialty communications the services included in these categories are 

 although the medium used to reach a given client’s target audience may be different across each of these disciplines the marketing message is developed and delivered in a similar way by providing clientspecific consulting services 

omnicom’s business model was built and evolves around its clients while our companies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is to structure our business offerings and allocate our resources based on the specific requirements of our clients as clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency they have tended to consolidate their business with larger multidisciplinary agencies or integrated groups of agencies accordingly our business model demands that multiple agencies within omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to execute against our clients’ specific marketing requirements we believe that this organizational philosophy and our ability to execute on it helps to differentiate us from our competition 

   our agency networks and our virtual networks provide us with the ability to integrate services across all disciplines this means that the delivery of these services can and does take place across agencies networks and geographic regions simultaneously 

further for the longer term we believe that our virtual network strategy facilitates better integration of services required by the demands of the marketplace for advertising and marketing communications services our overarching strategy for our business is to continue to use our virtual networks to grow our business relationships with our clients 

the various components of our business and material factors that affected us in 2006 are discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” of this report none of our acquisitions in 2006 2005 or 2004 were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations for information concerning our acquisitions see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  geographic regions and segments our total consolidated revenue is about evenly divided between us and nonus operations for financial information concerning domestic and foreign operations and segment reporting see our mda and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

  our clients consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy our agencies serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients across a variety of geographic regions and locations our clients participate in virtually all industry sectors of the global economy furthermore in many cases our agencies or networks serve different product groups within the same clients served by other omnicom agencies or networks for example our largest client was served by more than 100 of our agencies in 2006 and represented 36 of our 2006 consolidated revenue no other client accounted for more than 29 of our consolidated 2006 revenue each of our top 100 clients was served on average by more than 40 of our agencies in 2006 and represented 462 of our 2006 consolidated revenue 

  our employees at december 31 2006 we employed approximately 66000 people we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements the skillsets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client’s target audience recognizing the importance of this core competency we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency see our mda for a discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our historical results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

companies periodically review and change their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 

the businesses in which we participate are highly competitive key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop creative solutions that meet client needs the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis while many of our client relationships are longstanding companies put their advertising marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive our revenue may be adversely affected which could then affect our results of operations and financial condition 

government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

government agencies and consumer groups have directly or indirectly from time to time affected or attempted to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising marketing and corporate communications services whether through regulations or other governmental actions any such limitations on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices we cannot assure investors that such claims by businesses or governmental agencies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future 

the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel 

our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients’perceptions of or policies concerning conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to effectively manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 

in addition we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel our employees are our most important assets our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

   we receive approximately 46 of our revenue from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time for any reason it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns or they could reduce future spending a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients or the loss of several of our largest clients if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients would adversely affect our revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad including political instability and exchange controls which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions competition for client assignments and talented staff new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations there are some risks of doing business abroad including those of political instability and exchange controls which do not affect domesticfocused firms for financial information on our operations by geographic area see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 

we conduct business in various developing countries around the world the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices nationalization social political and economic instability and currency repatriation restrictions among other risks in addition commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague inconsistently administered and retroactively applied if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business our prospects business financial condition and results of operations in those countries could be harmed which could then have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt a moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies should our debt credit ratings be downgraded our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and our existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility however would increase if our longterm debt credit rating is downgraded additionally our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short or longterm debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies 

holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to 20 billion in whole or in part at specified dates in the future 

if we are required to satisfy a put to repurchase our convertible notes we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the put we also believe that we will still have ample capacity under our existing credit commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event however in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were decreased we could experience difficulties in funding our business operations and would have to seek additional funding alternatives as described more fully in our mda 

we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 

we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs as part of the review we conduct business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction despite our efforts we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks as a result we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

   goodwill may become impaired 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” or “gaap” resulting from our prior acquisition activities which principally represents the specialized knowhow of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired we annually test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows while we have concluded for each year presented in our financial statements that our goodwill is not impaired future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired any resulting impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 item 2 properties 

we maintain office space in many major cities around the world the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and we believe that our facilities are in suitable and wellmaintained condition for our current operations this space is primarily used for office and administrative purposes by our employees in performing professional services our principal corporate offices are at 437 madison avenue new york new york and one east weaver street greenwich connecticut we also maintain executive offices in london england and tokyo japan 

substantially all of our office space is leased from third parties with varying expiration dates ranging from one to 20 years certain of our leases are subject to rent reviews or contain various escalation clauses and certain of our leases require us to pay various operating expenses which may also be subject to escalation leases are generally denominated in the local currency of the operating entity our consolidated rent expense was 3519 million in 2006 3526 million in 2005 and 3453 million in 2004 after reduction for rents received from subleases of 223 million 235 million and 263 million respectively 

our obligations for future minimum base rents under terms of noncancelable real estate leases and other operating leases which include primarily office furniture and computer and technology equipment reduced by rents receivable from noncancelable subleases are in millions 

 see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our lease commitments and our mda for the impact of leases on our operating expenses 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

beginning on june 13 2002 several putative class actions were filed against us and certain senior executives in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the actions have since been consolidated under the caption in re omnicom group inc securities litigation  no 02cv4483 rcc on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of our common stock between february 20 2001 and june 11 2002 the consolidated complaint alleges among other things that our public filings and other public statements during that period contained false and misleading statements or omitted to state material information relating to 1 our calculation of the organic growth component of periodtoperiod revenue growth 2 our valuation of and accounting for certain internet investments made by our communicade group “communicade” which we contributed to seneca investments llc “seneca” in 2001 and 3 the existence and amount of certain 

   contingent future obligations in respect of acquisitions the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages plus costs and attorneys’ fees defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and on march 28 2005 the court dismissed portions 1 and 3 of the complaint detailed above the court’s decision denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss the remainder of the complaint did not address the ultimate merits of the case but only the sufficiency of the pleading defendants have answered the complaint and discovery is currently expected to conclude in the first half of 2007 plaintiffs have moved to have the proposed class certified and the defendants have opposed that motion which is now fully briefed 

in addition on june 28 2002 a derivative action was filed on behalf of omnicom in new york state court on february 18 2005 a second shareholder derivative action again purportedly brought on behalf of the company was filed in new york state court the derivative actions have been consolidated before one new york state justice and the plaintiffs have filed an amended consolidated complaint the consolidated derivative complaint questions the business judgment of certain current and former directors of omnicom by challenging among other things the valuation of and accounting for the internet investments made by communicade and the contribution of those investments to seneca the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties of good faith the lawsuit seeks from the directors the amount of profits received from selling omnicom stock and other unspecified damages to be paid to the company as well as costs and attorneys’ fees the defendants moved to dismiss the derivative complaint on the procedural ground that plaintiffs had failed to make a demand on the board on june 27 2006 the trial court entered a decision denying the motion to dismiss the decision did not address the merits of the allegations but rather accepted the allegations as true for the purposes of the motion as the court was required to do and excused plaintiffs from making a demand on the board the defendant filed an appeal of the court’s decision on the motion to dismiss the appeal has been fully briefed and oral argument before the appellate division first department occurred on february 9 2007 additionally the defendants moved for a stay of the proceedings in this litigation pending a decision being issued by the appellate division the trial court granted the motion staying the matter until february 28 2007 the parties have jointly requested the trial court extend the stay to march 30 2007 since the appellate division has not yet issued a decision 

the defendants in both cases believe that the allegations against them are baseless and intend to vigorously oppose the lawsuits currently we are unable to determine the outcome of these cases and the effect on our financial position or results of operations the outcome of any of these matters is inherently uncertain and may be affected by future events accordingly there can be no assurance as to the ultimate effect of these matters 

we are also involved from time to time in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we do not presently expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

we are a strategic holding company we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world on a global panregional and local basis our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications our business model was built and evolves around our clients while our companies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines we organize our services around our clients the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients’specific requirements should be the central focus in how we structure our business offerings and allocate our resources this clientcentric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client’s specific marketing requirements we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our clientcentric approach as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients in addition we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically either currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 

in prior years our industry was affected by several factors including geopolitical unrest and lagging economic conditions that contributed to a difficult business environment and industrywide margin contraction during this period we continued to invest in our businesses and our personnel and took action to reduce costs at some of our agencies to address the changing economic circumstances recently improving economic conditions coupled with the business trends described below have had a positive impact on our business and our industry 

several longterm trends continue to positively affect our business including our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to panregional and global markets and from traditional marketing channels to nontraditional channels and new media outlets additionally in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their marketing dollars clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of their traditional advertising and marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers 

the diversity and balance of our portfolio of companies and service offerings have enabled us to continue to grow our revenue operating income net income and earnings per share in the united states revenue grew at a rate of 78 in 2006 which is below our prior year’s rate of 100 on a constant currency basis revenue growth for our international business increased by 79 in 2006 which is an increase from our prior year’s rate of 35 overall in the past year we believe that our businesses have performed well across our operating regions in addition we expect to continue to increase our investment in an already improving asian market we also plan to focus on businesses that will complement and enhance our existing strategic platforms and service capabilities to better serve our clients in various regions 

in 2006 we experienced an increase in our operating margins over the previous year this improvement is the result of our new business initiatives and wins as well as our cost management actions our operating margin for 2006 was 130 compared to 128 in 2005 we expect that we will be able to maintain operating margins at 2006 levels and we will continue to pursue a strategy of optimizing our operating margins and maintaining a high level of investment in our people and our businesses 

given our size and breadth we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators the key indicators that we review focus on revenue and operating expenses 

we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth including growth by major geographic location growth by major marketing discipline growth from currency fluctuations growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients 

in recent years our revenue has been divided almost evenly between domestic and international operations in 2006 our overall revenue growth was 85 of which 07 was related to changes in foreign exchange rates and 02 was related to the acquisition of entities net of entities disposed the remainder 76 was organic growth 

   in 2006 traditional media advertising represented about 43 of the total revenue and grew by 60 over the prior year crm represented about 36 of the total revenue and grew by 130 over the previous year public relations represented about 10 of the total revenue and grew by 100 over the previous year and specialty communications represented about 11 of total revenue and grew by 37 over the previous year 

we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs and office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs technology related costs and depreciation and amortization each of our agencies requires service professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client’s brand and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client’s target audience the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software 

because we are a service business we monitor these costs on a percentage of revenue basis salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue whereas office and general expenses which are not directly related to servicing clients tend to decrease as a percentage of revenue as revenue increases because a significant portion of these expenses are relatively fixed in nature during 2006 salary and service costs increased to 711 of revenue from 707 of revenue in 2005 this increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue levels and the necessary increases in direct salaries salaryrelated costs and freelance labor costs necessary to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives as well as increases in incentivebased compensation costs office and general expenses declined to 159 of revenue from 165 in 2005 as a result of our continuing efforts to better align these costs with business levels on a locationbylocation basis 

our net income for 2006 increased by 93 to 8640 million from 7907 million in 2005 and our diluted eps increased by 144 to 499 from 436 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year this reduction was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 

critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies 

we have prepared the following summary of our accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related mda we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements including our discussion in note 1 setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail for a more complete understanding of accounting policies discussed below 

  estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a reporting period we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience current conditions and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results can differ from those estimates and it is possible that the differences could be material 

a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under sfas 142 and when evaluating costbased investments which consist of ownership interests in nonpublic companies to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred we consider and use several comparable market participant measurements to determine fair value including consideration of similar and recent transactions and when available and as appropriate we use comparative market multiples we also use a discounted cash flow 

   methodology numerous estimates and assumptions have to be made when completing a discounted cash flow valuation including estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates appropriate discount rates and capital structure additionally estimates must be made regarding revenue growth operating margins tax rates working capital requirements and capital expenditures judgment is required when determining fair value including when we evaluate the applicability of similar and recent transactions and when determining the appropriate comparative market multiples to be used actual results of operations cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material additional information about impairment testing under sfas 142 and valuation of costbased investments appears in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements as well as note 6 with respect to costbased investments 

a fair value approach is used in determining the award value of stockbased employee compensation in accordance with sfas 123r we utilize the blackscholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of option awards this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  acquisitions and goodwill we have historically made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in making acquisitions the price we pay is determined by various factors including specialized knowhow reputation competitive position geographic coverage and service offerings as well as our experience and judgment the amount we paid for acquisitions including cash stock and assumption of net liabilities totaled 3114 million in 2006 and 3272 million in 2005 approximately 51 and 63 respectively of these amounts related to contingent purchase price obligations paid during the respective year related to acquisitions previously completed 

a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations sometimes referred to as earnouts and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies is set forth in the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda the amount of contingent purchase price obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies are based on future performance contingent purchase price obligations are accrued in accordance with gaap when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain 

our acquisition strategy has been focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach andor their service capabilities to better serve our clients additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized knowhow of the acquisition targets accordingly like most service businesses a substantial portion of the intangible asset value that we acquire is the knowhow of the people which is treated as part of goodwill and in accordance with sfas no 141 business combinations “sfas 141” is not valued separately for each of our acquisitions we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such assets identified the majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets that we acquire is derived from customer relationships when making the necessary valuation assumptions of these identified intangible assets we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in accordance with paragraph 30 of sfas 142 we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments which are our five agency networks the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our clientcentric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions we then concluded that for each of our operating segments their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in paragraph 17 of sfas no131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information “sfas 131” and the guidance set forth in eitf d101 

   clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph 30 of fasb statement no 142 consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients in addition the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy and the provision of technology requirements which are generally limited to personal computers servers and offtheshelf software finally the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy based on the results of our impairment testing we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their book value and therefore our goodwill was not impaired 

additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  revenue recognition substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis and revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured we record revenue net of taxes including sales tax use tax value added tax andor excise tax certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements 

these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines — traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications 

more specifically in compliance with staff accounting bulletin “sab” 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” as updated by sab 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist the sales price must be fixed or determinable delivery performance and acceptance in accordance with the client arrangement and collection is reasonably assured 

because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways all of the key elements set forth above apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 

in the majority of our businesses we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned in certain cases we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and thirdparty production costs and are responsible for their payment recharging our clients for all costs incurred although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities the arrangements with our clients are such that in effect we act as an agent on their behalf in these cases costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue 

a small portion of our contractual arrangements with clients include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients additional information about our revenue recognition appears in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

  employee stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas 123 as amended by sfas 148 we elected effective january 1 2004 to account for stockbased employee compensation using the fair value method in determining the fair value of certain stockbased compensation awards we use certain estimates and assumptions such as expected life rate of risk free interest volatility and dividend yield if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value at the date of grant our actual results could be different as a result of our adoption of sfas 123 as amended by sfas 148 the fair value of stockbased employee compensation was recorded as an expense in the current and prior years accordingly our results for years prior to 2004 have been restated as if we had used the fair value method to account for stockbased employee compensation pretax stockbased employee compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 was 711 million 870 million and 1172 million respectively information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

   on january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” that requires among other things that we record stockbased compensation expense net of an estimate for awards that are expected to be forfeited for all unvested awards outstanding at january 1 2006 we recorded an adjustment to reflect the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle the adjustment in the first quarter of 2006 resulted in an increase in our operating profit and net income of 36 million and 20 million respectively because this adjustment did not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition we did not present this adjustment on an aftertax basis as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our income statement 

sfas 123r also requires that new stockbased compensation awards issued to individuals that are or will become retirementeligible during the vesting period of the award to be expensed over the lesser of the period from the date of grant through the retirementeligible date or the vesting date this differs from our previous policy for awards that were issued prior to adoption of sfas 123r with retirement eligibility provisions for those awards we recognized compensation expense over the vesting period and we accelerated compensation expense upon the triggering of a retirement event for the year ended december 31 2006 135 million of pretax amortization of stockbased employee compensation expense was recorded related to unvested awards at december 31 2005 that were issued prior to adoption of sfas 123r to individuals that were retirement eligible at december 31 2005 and the awards included retirement eligibility provisions had sfas 123r been in effect when these awards were issued stockbased compensation expense in 2006 would have been reduced by 135 million 

sfas 123r provides transition alternatives with respect to calculating the pool of windfall tax benefits within our additional paidin capital the “apic pool” that are available on the adoption date to offset potential future shortfalls the apic pool results from the amount by which our prior year tax deductions for stockbased compensation exceed the cumulative book stockbased compensation expense recognized in our financial statements we utilized the shortcut method as prescribed by fasb statement of position 123r3 to calculate the apic pool 

finally sfas 123r requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized stockbased employee compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required for the year ended december 31 2006 net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by 266 million which was recorded as an increase in cash provided by financing activities 

additional information regarding the changes required by sfas 123r and its impact on our financial statements can be found in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting pronouncements 

in addition to those discussed previously additional information regarding new accounting pronouncements can also be found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements note 1 to our consolidated financial statements also includes a summary of our significant accounting policies 

   financial results from operations — 2006 compared with 2005 

 the following yearoveryear analysis gives further details and insight into the changes in our financial performance 

  revenue when comparing performance between years we discuss nongaap financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes acquisitionsdispositions and organic growth have on reported revenue we derive significant revenue from international operations and changes in foreign currency rates between the years impact our reported results our reported results are also impacted by our acquisition and disposition activity and organic growth accordingly we provide this information to supplement the discussion of changes in revenue periodtoperiod 

our 2006 consolidated worldwide revenue increased 85 to 113769 million from 104811 million in 2005 the effect of foreign exchange impacts increased worldwide revenue by 723 million acquisitions net of disposals increased 2006 worldwide revenue by 259 million and organic growth increased worldwide revenue by 7976 million the components of total 2006 revenue growth in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” are summarized below dollars in millions 

 the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

        the components of revenue for 2006 and revenue growth compared to 2005 in our primary geographic markets are summarized below dollars in millions 

 as indicated foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by 723 million for 2006 the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the canadian dollar british pound euro and brazilian real against the us dollar which was offset primarily by the decline of the japanese yen against the us dollar based on exchange rates at january 31 2007 we expect foreign exchange impacts to increase our fullyear 2007 consolidated revenue by between 10 and 15 additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2006 and historically each year for us as a whole was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our single largest client represented 36 of our worldwide revenue in 2006 and 40 in 2005 no other client represented more than 29 in 2006 or 2005 our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 183 and 462 of our 2006 worldwide revenue respectively and 185 and 446 of our 2005 worldwide revenue respectively 

driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient branding activities we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising marketing and corporate communications services through various clientcentric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives these services include advertising brand consultancy crisis communications custom publishing database management digital and interactive marketing direct marketing directory advertising entertainment marketing environmental design experiential marketing field marketing financial  corporate businesstobusiness advertising graphic arts healthcare communications instore design investor relations marketing research media planning and buying mobile marketing services multicultural marketing nonprofit marketing organizational communications package design product placement promotional marketing public affairs public relations recruitment communications reputation consulting retail marketing search engine marketing and sports and event marketing in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications 

      operating expenses our 2006 worldwide operating expenses increased 7521 million or 82 to 98934 million from 91413 million in 2005 as shown below 

 because we provide professional services salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses during 2006 we continued to invest in our businesses and their professional personnel as a percentage of total operating expenses salary and service costs were 817 in 2006 and 811 in 2005 these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs most or 6749 million and 897 of the 7521 million increase in total operating expenses in 2006 resulted from increases in salary and service costs this increase was attributable to the increase in our revenue in 2006 and the necessary increases in the direct costs required to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives including direct salaries salary related costs and direct service costs including freelance labor costs and direct administrative costs such as travel as well as increases in incentivebased compensation costs this increase was partially offset by reductions in severance and employee stockbased compensation expense as a result salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased yeartoyear from 707 in 2005 to 711 in 2006 

office and general expenses represented 183 and 189 of our operating expenses in 2006 and 2005 respectively these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents technology costs and depreciation amortization of identifiable intangible assets professional fees and other overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue office and general expenses decreased in 2006 from 165 to 159 as a result of continuing efforts to better align these costs with business levels on a locationbylocation basis these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs although they tend to increase as our revenues increase the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues 

we expect our efforts to control operating expenses will continue as we continuously look for ways to increase the variability of our cost structure we expect that we will be able to maintain operating margins at 2006 levels and we will continue to pursue a strategy of optimizing our operating margins and maintaining a high level of investment in our people and our businesses 

included in office and general expense for 2006 operating margin is a pretax net loss of 05 million arising from the sale in the third quarter of a usbased healthcare business and several small businesses the sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the nondeductibility of goodwill this increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a onetime reduction of income tax expense from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in certain foreign tax laws the aggregate impact 

   of these events was a decrease in profit before tax of 05 million a decrease in tax expense of 18 million and an increase in net income of 13 million excluding the net loss of 05 million our 2006 operating margin was unchanged 

included in office and general expense for 2005 is a pretax net gain of 69 million arising from the sale in the first quarter of a majorityowned business located in australia and new zealand and the disposal of a nonstrategic business located in the united states due to the unusually high book tax rate caused by the nondeductibility of goodwill the book tax cost of the transactions was 61 million after deducting minority interest expense the impact of these transactions increased net income in 2005 by 04 million excluding the net gain of 69 million from investment activity office and general expenses were 166 of revenue in 2005 

  net interest expense our net interest expense increased in 2006 to 916 million as compared to 592 million in 2005 our gross interest expense increased by 469 million to 1249 million this increase was primarily impacted by 455 million of additional interest costs related to the issuance of our 590 senior notes due april 15 2016 “senior notes” and 239 million of additional interest costs associated with the amortization in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” no 9619 debtor’s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments “eitf 9619” of supplemental interest payments made with respect to our liquid yield option notes due 2031 “2031 notes” 

these increases were partially offset by interest expense savings relative to the redemption at maturity in june 2005 of our eurodenominated “€” 1524 million 520 notes as well as interest expense savings under our commercial paper program compared to the prior year the increase in interest income is the result of increased levels of cash and shortterm investments on hand during the year as well as increases in shortterm interest rates 

see “liquidity and capital resources” for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters 

  income taxes our 2006 consolidated effective income tax rate was 335 which is lower than our 2005 rate of 340 the 335 tax rate for 2006 was impacted by the following activity during the third quarter of 2006 we disposed of a usbased healthcare business and several small businesses as described above the sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the allocation of nondeductible goodwill in accordance with sfas 142 this increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a onetime reduction of income tax expense resulting from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in foreign tax laws excluding this activity our tax rate for 2006 would have been 337 the 340 tax rate for 2005 was also high as it was impacted by the sale in the first quarter of 2005 of a majorityowned business in australia and new zealand that resulted in a gain and an unusually high book tax rate on that gain excluding the effect of the gain and the related tax impact our 2005 tax rate would also have been 337 

  earnings per share eps for the foregoing reasons our net income in 2006 increased 733 million or 93 to 8640 million from 7907 million in 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 144 to 499 in 2006 as compared to 436 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year this reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan a substantial portion of our treasury share repurchases were made in connection with an accelerated share repurchase “asr” program described in our liquidity and capital resource discussion and in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

   financial results from operations — 2005 compared with 2004 

 the following yearoveryear analysis gives further details and insight into the changes in our financial performance 

  revenue when comparing performance between years we discuss nongaap financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes acquisitionsdispositions and organic growth have on reported revenues we derive significant revenue from international operations and changes in foreign currency rates between the years impact our reported results reported results are also impacted by our acquisition and disposition activity and organic growth accordingly we provide this information to supplement the discussion of changes in revenue periodtoperiod 

our 2005 consolidated worldwide revenue increased 75 to 104811 million from 97472 million in 2004 foreign exchange impacts increased worldwide revenue by 533 million the effect of acquisitions net of disposals decreased 2005 worldwide revenue by 288 million organic growth increased worldwide revenue by 7094 million the components of total 2005 revenue growth in the us “domestic” and the remainder of the world “international” are summarized below dollars in millions 

 the negative acquisition growth in international revenue is attributable to the disposition of a crm agency located in australia and new zealand in the first quarter of 2005 

   the components and percentages are calculated as follows 

    the components of revenue for 2005 and revenue growth compared to 2004 in our primary geographic markets are summarized below dollars in millions 

 as indicated foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by 533 million for 2005 the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the canadian dollar and brazilian real against the us dollar which was offset primarily by the decline of the british pound against the us dollar additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

due to a variety of factors in the normal course our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year the net result in 2005 and historically each year for us as a whole was an overall gain in new business under our clientcentric approach we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients revenue from our single largest client represented 40 of our worldwide revenue in 2005 and 43 in 2004 no other client represented more than 29 in 2005 or 2004 our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 185 and 446 of our 2005 worldwide revenue respectively and 183 and 451 of our 2004 worldwide revenue respectively 

in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below traditional media advertising crm public relations and specialty communications 

      operating expenses our 2005 worldwide operating expenses increased 6095 million or 71 to 91413 million from 85318 million in 2004 as shown below 

 because we provide professional services salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses during 2005 we continued to invest in our businesses and their professional personnel as a percentage of total operating expenses salary and service costs were 811 in 2005 and 803 in 2004 these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs most or 5661 million and 929 of the 6095 million increase in total operating expenses in 2005 resulted from increases in salary and service costs this increase was attributable to the increase in our revenue in 2005 and the necessary increases in the direct costs required to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives including direct salaries salary related costs and direct service costs including freelance labor costs and direct administrative costs such as travel in addition cashbased incentive compensation such as bonus and profit sharing increased in 2005 when compared to 2004 however this increase was largely offset by a reduction in the amortization of employee stockbased compensation as a result salary and service costs as a percentage of revenues increased yeartoyear from 702 in 2004 to 707 in 2005 

office and general expenses represented 189 and 197 of our operating expenses in 2005 and 2004 respectively these costs are comprised of office and equipment rent technology costs and depreciation amortization of identifiable intangible assets professional fees and other overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue office and general expenses decreased in 2005 from 173 to 165 as a result of continuing efforts to better align these costs with business levels on a locationbylocation basis these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs although they tend to increase as our revenues increase the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues 

included in office and general expense for 2005 is a pretax net gain of 69 million arising from the sale in the first quarter of a majorityowned business located in australia and new zealand and the disposal of a nonstrategic business located in the united states due to the unusually high book tax rate caused by the nondeductibility of goodwill the book tax cost of the transactions was 61 million after deducting minority interest expense the impact of these transactions increased net income in 2005 by 04 million 

included in office and general expense for 2004 was a net gain of 131 million related to investment activity during the first quarter of 2004 in march 2004 in connection with seneca investments llc’s recapitalization we agreed to exchange our remaining preferred stock in seneca for a 240 million senior secured note and 40 of seneca’s outstanding common stock the note due in march 2007 bears interest at a rate of 625 per annum the recapitalization transaction was required to be recorded at fair value and accordingly we recorded a pretax net gain of 240 million this gain was partially offset by losses of 109 million on other costbased investments unrelated to our investment in seneca we received distributions from seneca during 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 that reduced the outstanding balance of the note to zero 

excluding these net gains of 69 million and 131 million from investment activity office and general expenses were 166 of revenue in 2005 compared to 174 of revenue in 2004 and operating margin increased to 127 of revenue in 2005 from 123 of revenue in 2004 

  net interest expense our net interest expense increased in 2005 to 592 million as compared to 366 million in 2004 our gross interest expense increased by 269 million to 780 million this increase resulted from 244 million of additional interest costs associated with the amortization in accordance with eitf 9619 

   of supplemental interest payments we made during 2005 and the fourth quarter of 2004 to holders of certain of our convertible notes in august 2005 we paid 335 million to holders of our 2032 notes to not exercise certain put rights and in november 2004 we paid 148 million and 15 million in the aggregate respectively to consenting holders of our 2031 notes and zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due 2033 “2033 notes” as incentives to consent to certain amendments to our indentures and not exercise certain put rights substantially all of the yearoveryear increase in these supplemental interest payments was due to market increases in shortterm interest rates these increases were partially offset by interest expense savings relative to the redemption at maturity in june 2005 of our €1524 million 520 notes 

  income taxes our 2005 consolidated effective income tax rate was 340 excluding the impact relating to an unusually high book tax rate on the 2005 net gain on the sale of certain foreign businesses as described above in our discussion on operating expenses our tax rate was 337 which is comparable to our 2004 year rate of 336 

the fasb issued two staff positions on accounting for income taxes to address recent changes enacted by the united states congress staff position fas 1091 application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes for the tax deduction provided to us based manufacturers by the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs act” “fsp no 1091” and staff position fas 1092 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provisions within the american jobs creation act of 2004 “fsp no 1092 we believe that fsp 1091 does not apply to our business in the fourth quarter of 2005 we repatriated 479 million of foreign earnings utilizing the 85 dividend received deduction provided by the jobs act and in accordance with fsp 1092 we recorded a 27 million domestic tax liability which is included in our full year effective tax rate of 340 

  earnings per share eps for the foregoing reasons our net income in 2005 increased 672 million by 93 to 7907 million from 7235 million in 2004 diluted earnings per share increased 124 to 436 in 2005 as compared to 388 in the prior year for the reasons described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year this reduction was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements including contractual obligations 

historically substantially all of our nondiscretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand our principal nondiscretionary funding requirement is our working capital in addition as discussed below we have contractual obligations related to our debt senior notes and convertible notes our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years 

our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders repurchases of our common stock payments for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand and in 2006 from our 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 590 senior notes due april 15 2016 “senior notes” offering the gross proceeds from the senior notes sold in march 2006 were 9951 million in addition in any given year depending on the level of discretionary activity we may use other sources of available funding such as the liquidation of shortterm investments or the issuance of commercial paper to finance these activities 

we have a seasonal working capital cycle working capital requirements are lowest at yearend the fluctuation in working capital requirements between the lowest and highest points during the course of the year can be more than 15 billion this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients including when we place media and incur production costs we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations during the year we manage liquidity 

   through our credit facilities as discussed below under “cash management” at december 31 2006 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 9037 million from december 31 2005 the components of the increase in 2006 are summarized below dollars in millions 

 the principal cash sources and principal discretionary cash uses numbers presented above are nongaap financial measures these amounts exclude changes in working capital and certain other investing and financing activities including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund these working capital changes this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 

  contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of our business the following table summarizes information about certain of our obligations as of december 31 2006 and should be read together with note 3 bank loans and lines of credit note 4 longterm debt and convertible notes note 10 commitments and contingent liabilities note 11 fair value of financial instruments and note 12 financial instruments and market risk to our consolidated financial statements 

 as more fully described below under the heading “debt instruments guarantees and related covenants” the holders of the convertible notes included in the table above have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date as set forth in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 15740 million of the 20415 million of the convertible notes could be due in less than one year 

    in the normal course of business our agencies enter into various contractual media commitments on behalf of our clients at levels substantially exceeding our revenue these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the providers historically we have not experienced significant losses for media commitments entered into on behalf of our clients and we believe that we do not have substantial exposure to potential losses of this nature in the future as we monitor closely the credit worthiness of our clients in the event that we are committed to the media services and our client has not paid us we believe that the risk of material loss is minimal because in the normal course of business we have reasonable options available to us to substantially mitigate potential losses 

  contingent acquisition obligations certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations often referred to as earnouts we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired entity during the postacquisition transition period these payments are not contingent upon future employment the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for prior acquisitions assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels is approximately 448 million as of december 31 2006 the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in accordance with us gaap we have not recorded a liability for these items on our balance sheet since the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period changes in the acquired entities’ performance and changes in foreign currency exchange rates these differences could be significant the contingent purchase price obligations as of december 31 2006 calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels are as follows 

 in addition owners of interests in certain of our subsidiaries or affiliates have the right in certain circumstances to require us to purchase additional ownership interests in those companies assuming that the subsidiaries and affiliates perform over the relevant periods at their current profit levels the aggregate amount we could be required to pay in future periods is approximately 283 million 193 million of which relates to obligations that are currently exercisable if these rights are exercised there would be an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense the ultimate amount payable relating to these transactions will vary because it is primarily dependent on the future results of operations of the subject businesses the timing of the exercise of these rights and changes in foreign currency exchange rates the actual amount that we pay is likely to be different from this estimate and the difference could be significant the obligations that exist for these agreements as of december 31 2006 calculated using the assumptions above are as follows 

    sources and uses of cash 

our cash requirements have historically been funded by a combination of our operating cash flow and cash on hand as well as points in time when we have opportunistically accessed the capital markets our capital market transactions have included issuing 10 billion in tenyear fixed rate notes in 2006 and convertible notes in an aggregate principle amount of 6000 million 9000 million and 8500 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of our shares and the repayment of maturing debt on march 31 2006 we entered into an agreement to purchase 55 million shares of our outstanding common stock for 4587 million we repurchased the shares under an accelerated share repurchase “asr” program with a financial institution at 8341 per share with an initial settlement date of april 3 2006 the purchase was funded using a portion of the proceeds from our senior notes offering during the second quarter of 2006 the financial institution purchased the 55 million shares of our common stock in the open market and we paid a settlement amount of 451 million referred to as the purchase price adjustment based upon the difference between the actual cost of the shares purchased by the financial institution of 9161 per share and the initial purchase price of 8341 per share 

at december 31 2006 we had 17395 million in cash and cash equivalents in addition we had 25 billion in unused committed credit facilities available for immediate use to fund our cash needs these credit facilities are more fully described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

our operating cash flow and access to the capital markets could be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control additionally access to the capital markets could be impaired by adverse changes to the short and longterm debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies 

standard and poor’s rating service currently rates our longterm debt a moody’s investors service rates our longterm debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our longterm debt a our shortterm debt credit ratings are a2 p2 and f2 by the respective agencies our outstanding senior notes convertible notes and bank credit facilities do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facilities however will increase if our longterm debt credit rating is lowered 

as described in note 3 our committed bank facilities contain two financial covenants relating to cash flow and interest coverage which we met by a significant margin as of december 31 2006 

we believe that our current financial condition provides us with the ability to readily access the capital markets also our cash balances combined with our liquidity of shortterm investments operational cash flows and unused committed borrowing capacity are sufficient to support our foreseeable cash requirements arising from working capital outstanding debt capital expenditures dividends acquisitions and stock repurchases 

cash management 

we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through treasury centers in north america and europe each day operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center likewise operations that require funding will borrow funds from their regional treasury center the treasury centers then aggregate the net position of the operating companies the net position is either invested with or borrowed from third party providers to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity they have the ability to access local currency lines of credit our 25 billion committed bank facilities or issue up to 15000 million of us dollardenominated commercial paper this enables us to reduce our consolidated debt levels and minimize interest expense as well as centrally manage our exposure to foreign exchange 

our cash and cash equivalents increased by 9037 million and our shortterm investments decreased by 1848 million from the prior year shortterm investments include investments of our excess cash which we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle generally within one year 

   we manage our net debt position which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and shortterm investments centrally through our treasury centers as discussed above our net debt outstanding at december 31 2006 decreased by 262 million as compared to the prior yearend as summarized below dollars in millions 

 net debt is a nongaap financial measure we believe this presentation is meaningful for understanding our net debt position and it reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management 

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

we maintain a credit facility with a consortium of banks providing borrowing capacity of up to 2500 million as described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements this credit facility is available to provide credit support for issuances under our 15000 million commercial paper program as well as to provide backup liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us we typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper or by borrowing under our shortterm uncommitted lines of credit occasionally we may draw down on our credit facility during 2006 we issued and redeemed 136 billion of commercial paper the average term of the commercial paper was 28 days as of december 31 2006 we had no commercial paper or bank loans outstanding under these credit facilities at december 31 2006 we had shortterm bank loans of 105 million outstanding which are comprised of bank overdrafts by our international subsidiaries these bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the subsidiaries’ bank agreements 

our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreements these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda for these purposes ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to no more than 30 times in addition they require us to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 50 times at december 31 2006 we were in compliance with these covenants as our ratio of debt to ebitda was 18 times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was 134 times 

in march 2006 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 590 senior notes due april 15 2016 the gross proceeds from the issuance were 9951 million the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a 605 yield to maturity the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc and two of our whollyowned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc and omnicom finance inc as coobligors similar to our convertible notes the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the coobligors 

in june 2005 upon maturity we redeemed our eurodenominated bonds for 1851 million the bonds paid a fixed rate of 52 to maturity 

at december 31 2006 we had a total of 20415 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding including 8470 million 2031 notes that were issued in february 2001 7270 million 2032 notes that were issued in march 2002 394 million 2033 notes that were issued in june 2003 and 4281 million zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due 2038 “2038 notes” that were originally issued in june 2003 as 2033 notes and were subsequently amended in june 2006 to become the 2038 notes 

   the holders of our 2031 notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in february of each year the holders of our 2032 notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in august of each year the holders of our 2033 notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on june 15 2008 2010 2013 2018 2023 and on each june 15 annually thereafter through june 15 2032 the holders of our 2038 notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on june 15 2008 2010 2013 2018 2023 and on each june 15 annually thereafter through june 15 2037 the 2031 2032 2033 and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios only upon the occurrence of certain events including if our common shares trade above certain levels if we effect extraordinary transactions or in the case of the 2031 notes and the 2032 notes if our longterm debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard  poor’s ratings service or baa3 or lower by moody’s investors service or in the case of the 2033 notes and the 2038 notes to bbb or lower by sp and ba1 or lower by moody’s these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder’s right to cause us to repurchase the notes for additional information about the terms of these notes see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

in august 2005 we paid a supplemental interest payment of 335 million to qualified noteholders of our 2032 notes equal to 3750 per 1000 principal amount of notes that did not put their notes back to us the total supplemental interest payment is being amortized ratably over a 12month period to the next put date ending in august 2006 in accordance with eitf 9619 

in february 2006 we paid a supplemental interest payment of 392 million to qualified noteholders of our 2031 notes that did not put their notes back to us the total supplemental interest payment is being amortized ratably over a 12month period to the next put date in february 2007 in accordance with eitf 9619 

in june 2006 we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of 2750 per 1000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2033 notes that did not put their notes back to us and consented to the amendments to the notes and related indenture as of june 27 2006 the principal amendment extended the maturity of the notes from june 15 2033 to july 1 2038 the additional amendments conformed other terms of the notes for the extension of the maturity date as well as amending the comparable yield on june 21 2006 we repurchased 1325 million of 2033 notes that were put to us with respect to the remaining 4675 million of 2033 notes as of june 30 2006 noteholders holding a combined amount of 4281 million consented to the amendments were paid 2750 per 1000 note and their notes were amended the total supplemental interest payment of 117 million is being amortized ratably over a 24month period to the next put date in accordance with eitf 9619 the remaining noteholders of the 2033 notes comprising 394 million aggregate principal amount of notes did not consent to the amendments as a result these notes are still outstanding and were not amended and these noteholders were not paid the supplemental interest payment the next put date for these notes is june 15 2008 

in july 2006 we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of 3250 per 1000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2032 notes as of august 1 2006 that did not put their notes back to us on august 4 2006 we repurchased 1652 million of our 2032 notes that were put to us with respect to the remaining 7270 million of notes noteholders were paid a total supplemental interest payment of 236 million on august 2 2006 which is being amortized ratably over a 12month period to the next put date in accordance with eitf 9619 

in february 2007 we did not pay a supplemental interest payment to qualified noteholders of our 2031 notes additionally none of the 2031 notes were put back to us for repayment 

   our outstanding debt and amounts available under these facilities as of december 31 2006 dollars in millions were as follows 

 additional information about our indebtedness is included in notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations which are generally denominated in the local currency the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 12 of our consolidated financial statements for the most part our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our net income 

while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies our major nonus currency markets are the european monetary union emu the united kingdom japan brazil and canada as an integral part of our treasury operations we enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts at december 31 2006 we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of 479 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany cash movement the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from two to 365 days with an average duration of just over 100 days 

in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement we enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge us dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center whose functional currency is the british pound at december 31 2006 we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as there was no commercial paper outstanding 

additionally at december 31 2006 we had crosscurrency interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional principal amount of €2300 million euro maturing in 2010 and japanese yenbased crosscurrency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of japanese yen 220 billion maturing in 2013 see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the fair value of each type of derivative instrument 

the forward foreign exchange and swap contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program as a result of these financial instruments we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably in using these contracts we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk to minimize counterparty risk we only enter into these contracts with major wellknown banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating 

   these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a valueatrisk computation valueatrisk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments the valueatrisk analysis we performed on our december 31 2006 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action if appropriate 

  debt instruments in march 2006 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due april 15 2016 the gross proceeds from the issuance were 9951 million the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a 605 yield to maturity the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc and two of our whollyowned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc and omnicom finance inc as coobligors similar to our convertible notes the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the coobligors 

in june 2006 we amended and extended our fiveyear credit facility to june 23 2011 and increased the amount available from 21 billion to 24 billion with substantially the same bank consortium in conjunction with this amendment and extension we terminated our 4000 million 364day revolving credit facility that was due to expire subsequently in september 2006 the facility was increased from 24 billion to 25 billion we have the ability to classify outstanding borrowings if any under our fiveyear credit facility as longterm debt 

in funding our daytoday liquidity we are an active participant in the commercial paper market with a 15 billion program as of december 31 2006 we had no commercial paper outstanding our credit facility provides credit support for commercial paper as well as providing backup liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us 

our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank jp morgan chase hsbc abn amro deutsche bank of america societe generale and bbva we also include large regional banks in the us such as wachovia us bancorp northern trust pnc and wells fargo we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as sumitomo in japan fortis in belgium intesa san paolo in italy scotia in canada and westpac in australia 

our other longterm debt consists principally of convertible notes as previously discussed the holders of these convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date including our stock price shortterm interest rates and a factor for credit risk 

if the convertible notes are put back to us our interest expense could increase the extent if any of the increase in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced when we refinance the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the instrument 

the supplemental interest payments made in 2005 and 2006 to qualified noteholders as described above under “debt instruments guarantees and related covenants” are one method of keeping the convertible notes outstanding if we are required to satisfy a put based on our current financial condition and expectations we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any put while still preserving ample capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event 

our credit commitments allow either the issuance of commercial paper or bank loans and we would likely fund the put initially using some combination of these instruments we would then evaluate all funding alternatives available to us to replenish our credit capacity and liquidity we believe the funding alternatives would include substantially all forms of debt equity and convertible instruments available to us by accessing the public or private capital markets our evaluation would likely include the expected cash flows from the normal course of our business operations and the credit capacity to fund additional potential puts on the remaining outstanding convertible notes 

   currently we meet all of our debt covenant requirements our credit facilities contain financial covenants limiting the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda for purposes of these covenants ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to no more than 30 times at december 31 2006 our ratio of debt to ebitda was 18 times in addition we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 50 times at december 31 2006 our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was 134 times we were in compliance with these covenants in addition the credit facilities do not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends 

even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollarfordollar basis it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio if we were to replace our convertible notes with interestbearing debt at prevailing rates this potential increase in interest expense would negatively impact our coverage ratios such as ebitda to interest expense however the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds if either our ratio of debt to ebitda increased by 50 or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense decreased by 50 we would still be in compliance with these covenants therefore based on our current coverage ratios our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements thus we do not expect any negative impact on our credit ratings if the convertible notes are put to us

      the various components of our business and material factors affecting us
in 2001 are discussed in our managements discussion and analysis of financial
conditions and results of operations which begins on page 5 of this report

      geographic regions our total consolidated revenue is about evenly divided
between us and nonus operations for financial information concerning
domestic and foreign operations and segment reporting see note 5 to our
consolidated financial statements at pages f12 of this report for financial
information concerning our acquisitions in 2001 see note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements on page f10 of this report

      our clients we had over 5000 clients in 2001 many of which were served
by more than one of our agency brands our 10 largest and 200 largest clients in
the aggregate accounted for 17 and 48 respectively of our 2001 consolidated
revenue our largest client was served by 20 of our agency brands last year
this client accounted for 54 of our 2001 consolidated revenue no other client
accounted for more than 25 of our consolidated revenue

      our employees we employed over 57000 people at december 31 2001 we are
not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements see our
management discussion and analysis at page 5 of this report for a discussion of
the effect of salary and related costs on our 2001 results of operations

      risks we face risks typical of marketing and corporate communications
services companies and other services businesses generally including risks
arising out of changes in general economic conditions competitive factors
client communication requirements and the hiring and retention of key
employees in addition due to our international operations we are subject to
translation risk associated with currency fluctuations exchange controls and
similar risks discussed in our management discussion and analysis at pages 5 to
12 of this report for financial information on our operations by geographic
area see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements at page f12 of this
report

      our revenue is dependent upon marketing and corporate communication
requirements of our clients and tends to be highest in the second and fourth
quarters of the calendar year see our management discussion and analysis
beginning on page 5 of this report for a discussion of the effect of market
conditions september 11th and other factors on our 2001 results of operations

      government agencies and consumer groups have from time to time directly or
indirectly affected or attempted to affect the scope content and manner of
presentation of advertising and other marketing communications we believe the
total volume of advertising and marketing communications will not be materially
affected by future legislation or regulation although the scope content and
manner of presentation will likely continue to change

2 properties

including our principal corporate offices in new york city substantially all of
our office space is leased certain of our leases are subject to rent reviews
under various escalation clauses and certain of our leases require our payment

77a managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
      operations critical accounting policies and quantitative and qualitative
      information about market risk

financial results from operations 2001 compared with 2000

      revenue our consolidated worldwide revenue for 2001 increased 119 to
68894 million from 61542 million in 2000 this is a result of growth in
our domestic operations of 141 to 37170 million from 32582 million in
2000 and growth in our international operations of 95 to 31724 million
from 28960 million in 2000

      foreign exchange impacts reduced our international revenue by 1740
million during the year reducing our international growth by 60 and our
overall growth by 28 the most significant impacts came from the euro and the
british pound as these markets represented 700 of our international
operations the effect of acquisitions net of divestitures increased our
worldwide revenue by 63 domestic revenue by 68 and international revenue by
57 the balance of the increase in revenue represents net new business wins
and additional revenue from expanding the scope of services provided to existing
clients

      in addition to expanding our client base expanding the scope of services
and the extension of additional services to clients several market trends
continued to affect our business these trends include clients increasingly
expanding the focus of their brand strategies from a national market to the
global market and in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness
from their marketing dollars clients are increasingly requiring greater
coordination of their traditional advertising and marketing activities and
tending to concentrate these activities with a smaller number of service
providers

      due to a variety of factors including the trends mentioned above in the
normal course of business our agencies both gain and lose clients each year
the net result in 2001 and historically each year for omnicom as a whole was an
overall gain in new business due to our multiple independent agency structure
and the breadth of our service offerings and geographic reach our agencies have
more than 5000 active client relationships in the aggregate our single largest
client in 2001 represented 54 of worldwide revenue and no other client
represented more than 25 our 10 largest and 200 largest clients represented
170 and 480 of our worldwide revenue respectively

      revenue from our domestic operations increased in 2001 by 141 over 2000
excluding foreign exchange impacts revenue from our international operations
increased by 155 over 2000 primarily the result of the strong performance of
our agencies in the eu and other international markets and several
acquisitions in asia additional geographic information relating to our business
is contained in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements at page f12 of
this report

      driven by clients continuous demand for more effective and efficient
branding activities we strive to provide through various client centric agency
networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives an extensive
range of marketing and corporate communications services these services include
advertising brand consultancy crisis communications custom publishing
database management digital and interactive marketing direct marketing
directory and businesstobusiness advertising employee communications
environmental design field marketing healthcare communications marketing
research media planning and buying multicultural marketing nonprofit
marketing promotional marketing public affairs public relations recruitment
communications sports and event marketing and other specialty communications
in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand
the scope of our services to key clients we monitor revenue by marketing
discipline and group them into the following four categories traditional media
advertising customer relationship management crm public relations and
specialty communications

      traditional media advertising revenue represented 436 or 30063
million of our worldwide revenue during 2001 as compared to 442 or 27189
million in 2000 the remainder of our revenue 564 or 38831 million in
2001 and 558 or 34354 million in 2000 was related to our other marketing
and corporate communication services the breakdown of this revenue was 308
crm 143 public relations and 113 specialty communications revenue for
these services in 2001 increased when compared to 2000 by 165 for crm 43
for public relations and 159 for specialty communications

      september 11th and market conditions the tragic events of september 11th
adversely impacted our business we experienced disruptions in client spending
patterns related to the cancellation and postponement of activities as a
result operating margins deteriorated during the third quarter this decline
occurred primarily


                                       5
page

because we had only a limited ability to adjust our cost structure in response
to the sudden reduction in revenues

      we do not believe september 11th permanently impacted any of our agencies
while the specific effects of september 11th began to dissipate over the
remainder of 2001 overall economic conditions remained weak we believe that
the diversity of our clients across industries the broad range of services our
agencies provide the diversity of our geographic locations and the flexibility
of certain elements of our cost structure mitigated much of the economic impact
on our business as a whole

      operating expenses our 2001 worldwide operating expense increased 122
to 59212 million from 52761 million in 2000

      the most significant component of our cost structure is salary and related
costs which increased by 3162 million to 39496 million in 2001 from
36334 the prior year these expenses function as a semivariable component of
our cost structure due to our ability to adjust workforce levels and incentive
compensation to mitigate fluctuations in the performance of our individual
agencies accordingly to compensate for the impact of september 11th and weak
economic conditions in 2001 we reduced these costs as a percentage of revenue
to 573 from 590 in 2000

      our remaining operating expenses which primarily consist of occupancy
costs depreciation amortization and client service costs increased by 3289
million to 19716 million in 2001 from 16427 the prior year these costs
are generally less variable and are adjusted in response to business trends over
time as a result these expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to 286
in 2001 from 267 in 2000

      in the first quarter of 2001 we recorded a 29 million after tax charge
49 million pretax for the cumulative effect of adopting effective january
1 2001 a new accounting principle applicable to financial instruments
statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities sfas no 133 the charge resulted from
our accounting for a hedge of our net yen investments we utilized cross
currency interest rate swap contracts to hedge our net yen investments
consistent with our policy with respect to derivative instruments and hedging
activities and in accordance with sfas no 133 when the spot rate is declared
as the underlying hedge of a net investment any ineffectiveness is recorded in
operating income or expense during the first quarter of 2001 the company
replaced the contract with a floating rate cross currency swap contract as a
result minimal ineffectiveness will result for the remaining term of up to five
years

      operating margin our operating margin declined for the year to 141 from
143 in 2000 exclusive of a gain of 1100 million pretax and 638 million
aftertax on a portion of our investment in razorfish inc the reduction was
primarily the result of the effects of september 11th and subsequent further
weakening of economic conditions including the razorfish gain in 2000 our
operating margin was 161

      net interest expense our net interest expense for 2001 decreased to 728
million from 765 million in 2000 this decrease resulted from the conversion
of our 4 14 convertible subordinated debentures at the end of 2000 and the
general lowering of shortterm interest rates as the year progressed these
benefits were partially offset by increased borrowings used to fund acquisitions
and stock repurchases completed during the year in 2002 we expect the
conversion of our 2 14 convertible subordinated debentures which occurred at
the end of 2001 to further reduce reported interest expense

      income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was 393 in 2001
as compared to 403 in 2000 exclusive of the tax impact of the razorfish
gain the decrease was primarily attributable to the implementation of various
planning and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce the tax inefficiency
of our holding company structure as well as the lowering of statutory rates in
several international markets including the razorfish gain in 2000 our
consolidated effective income tax rate was 405

      equity in affiliates and minority interests in 2001 our equity in
affiliates increased by 156 to 126 million from 109 million in 2000 the
increase resulted from new acquisitions of affiliated companies and increased
ownership of existing affiliated companies partially offset by increased
ownership in certain affiliates that resulted in their consolidation during the
year and lower earnings of certain affiliates

      in 2001 minority interests decreased by 33 to 528 million from 546
million in 2000 the decrease was primarily due to lower earnings of certain
subsidiaries partially offset by our taking increased ownership


                                       6
page

positions in certain affiliates that resulted in their subsequent consolidation
and the related recognition of their minority interests

      earnings per share eps our net income for 2001 increased by 157 to
5031 million from 4350 million in 2000 exclusive of the razorfish gain and
our diluted eps increased by 125 to 270 from 240 while our net income in
2001 was positively impacted by the conversion of the 4 14 convertible
subordinated debentures at the end of 2000 the shares associated with the
conversion of these debentures were included in computing diluted eps for both
2001 and 2000 foreign exchange impacts had the effect of reducing diluted eps
in 2001 versus 2000 by 006 including the razorfish gain our net income
increased by 10 to 5031 million from 4988 million in 2000 and our diluted
eps decreased by 11 to 270 from 273 in 2000

financial results from operations 2000 compared with 1999

      revenue our consolidated worldwide revenue for 2000 increased 200 to
61542 million from 51305 million in 1999 this was a result of growth in
domestic operations of 286 to 32582 million from 25329 million in 1999
and growth in international operations of 115 to 28960 million from
25976 million in 1999

      foreign exchange impacts reduced our international revenue by 2855
million during the year reducing our international growth by 110  and overall
growth by 56 the most significant impacts came from the euro and the british
pound as these markets represented 72 of our international business the effect
of acquisitions net of divestitures increased our worldwide revenue by 89
our domestic revenue by 108 and our international revenue by 71 the balance
of the increase represents net new business wins and additional revenue from
expanding the scope of services to existing clients

      revenue from our domestic operations increased in 2000 by 286 over 1999
excluding foreign exchange impacts revenue from our international operations
increased by 225 over 1999 primarily the result of the strong performance by
our agencies based in the eu and several acquisitions in the united kingdom
and france additional geographic information relating to our business is
contained in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements at page f12 of
this report

      traditional media advertising revenue represented 442 or 27189
million of our worldwide revenue during 2000 as compared to 467 or 23965
million in 1999 the remainder of our revenue 558 or 34354 million in
2000 and 533 or 27341 million in 1999 was related to our other marketing
and corporate communication services the breakdown of this revenue was 296
crm 153 public relations and 109 specialty communications revenue for
these services in 2000 increased when compared to 1999 by 283 for crm 246
for public relations and 204 specialty communications

      operating expenses our 2000 worldwide operating expenses increased 197
to 52761 million from 44064 million in 1999 the most significant
component of our cost structure was salary and related costs which increased by
5794 million to 36334 million in 2000 from 30540 in 1999 salary and
related costs represented about 590 of our total revenue in each of 2000 and
1999 the remaining operating expenses primarily consisting of occupancy costs
depreciation amortization and client service costs increased to 267 of our
total revenue to 16427 in 2000 from 264 in 1999

      net interest expense our net interest expense for 2000 increased to 765
million from 504 million in 1999 this increase was due to an increase in
interest rates and higher average borrowings during 2000 the higher average
borrowings were the result of acquisition payments and share repurchases during
the year

      operating margin our operating margin increased to 143 exclusive of a
gain of 1100 million pretax and 638 million aftertax on a portion of our
investment in razorfish as compared to 141 in 1999 we were able to improve
our operating margin in 2000 by enhancing our operating leverage and through our
continued emphasis on cost control and corporate purchasing efficiencies
including the razorfish gain in 2000 operating margins were 161

      income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was 403 in 2000
excluding the tax impact of the razorfish gain as compared to 406 in 1999
the decrease was primarily attributable to the implementation of various
planning and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce the tax inefficiency
of our

page

holding company structure as well as the lowering of statutory rates in several
international markets including the tax impact of the razorfish gain our
consolidated effective income tax rate was 405

      equity in affiliates and minority interests in 2000 our equity in
affiliates decreased by 292 to 109 million from 154 million in 1999 this
decrease resulted from our taking an increased ownership position in certain
affiliates that resulted in the subsequent consolidation of their income in our
2000 financial statements and noncash losses from restructuring actions taken
by one of our affiliated companies

      in 2000 minority interests increased by 31 to 546 million from 529
million in 1999 the increase was primarily due to acquisitions including
increased ownership positions in some of our affiliates that resulted in their
subsequent consolidation and higher earnings at subsidiaries where minority
interests are held by third parties

      earnings per share eps our net income for 2000 increased by 199 from
3629 million in 1999 excluding the razorfish gain and diluted eps increased
by 194 to 240 excluding the razorfish gain from 201 foreign exchange
impacts reduced eps by 010 including the razorfish gain our consolidated net
income increased by 375 to 4988 million in 2000 from 3629 million in 1999
and our diluted eps increased to 273 from 201 in 1999

critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements

      we are a holding company our business is conducted through more than
1500 subsidiary agencies operating in more than 100 countries our agencies
provide a broad range of marketing and corporate communications services to more
than 5000 clients representing nearly every industry sector

      we have prepared the following supplemental summary of accounting policies
to assist in better understanding our financial statements and the related
management discussion and analysis readers are encouraged to consider this
supplement together with our consolidated financial statements and the related
notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more complete understanding
of accounting policies discussed below

      estimates readers are reminded that the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or
gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates
and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a
reporting period actual results can differ from those estimates and it is
possible that the differences could be material

      revenue a small portion of our contractual arrangements with clients
includes performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our
revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals
this revenue has historically been less than 20 of our annual consolidated
revenue we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative
goals are achieved or when our performance against qualitative goals is
determined by our clients additional information about revenue appears in note
1 to our consolidated financial statements on pages f7 to f10 of this report

      acquisitions we have historically made and expect to continue to make
acquisitions in making these acquisitions the price we pay is determined by
various factors including our prior experience and judgement the amount we
paid for acquisitions including cash stock and assumption of net liabilities
totaled 8447 million in 2001 and 8498 million in 2000 these acquisitions
were accounted for as purchases

      most of our acquisitions have been relatively small transactions made
consistent with our strategy of building our various agency brands through the
extension of their service capabilities and geographic reach the intangibles
that result from these acquisitions principally result from the purchased
companies knowhow reputation experience and geographic location these
intangibles have been amortized on a straightline basis over a period not to
exceed 40 years and have been written down if and to the extent they have been
determined to be impaired

      additional information about acquisitions appears in notes 1 and 2 to our
consolidated financial statements on pages f7 to f10 of this report and
information about changes in gaap relative to accounting for acquisitions is
described in new accounting pronouncements on pages f21 to f22 of this report

      other investments management continually monitors the value of its
investments to determine whether an other than temporary impairment has
occurred a variety of factors are considered when making this determination
including the current market value of the investment and the financial condition
and prospects of the investee

      in may 2001 the company received a nonvoting nonparticipating preferred
stock interest in a newly formed company seneca investments llc in exchange
for its contribution of communicade the companys subsidiary that conducted its
eservices industry investment activities the common shareholder of seneca who
owns all the common stock is an established private equity investment firm we
did not recognize a gain or loss on senecas formation and management believes
that the carrying value of our seneca investment approximated its fair value at
december 31 2001 additional information about seneca is contained in note 6 to
our consolidated financial statements at pages f13 to f14 of this report

      new accounting pronouncements in june 2001 the fasb issued statement of
financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations sfas 141 and
statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets sfas 142 the fasb also issued statement of financial
accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas
143 in june 2001 and statement of financial accounting standards no 144
accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas 144 in
august 2001

      sfas 141 requires all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001
to be accounted for under the purchase method sfas 141 superseded accounting
pronouncement bulletin apb opinion no 16 business combinations and
statement of financial accounting standards no 38 accounting for
preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises and is effective for all
business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 given that all of our
acquisitions in 2000 and 2001 were accounted for under the purchase method the
adoption of sfas 141 on july 1 2001 and the cessation of goodwill amortization
on post july 1 2001 acquisitions as required by sfas 142 as discussed below
was not material to our 2001 consolidated results of operations or financial
position

      sfas 142 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 supersedes apb opinion no 17
intangible assets effective january 1 2002 companies are no longer required
to amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives but
these assets will be subject to periodic testing for impairment additionally
goodwill acquired in a business combination for which the acquisition date was
after june 30 2001 is no longer required to be amortized had the cessation of
goodwill amortization expense been in effect on january 1 2001 diluted eps
would have been increased by an amount estimated at 042 to 047

      we expect to complete the required impairment testing by the end of the
second quarter of 2002 and are currently evaluating the effect that such
adoption may have on our future consolidated results of operations and financial
position however at this time we do not expect that the results of the
impairment testing will be material to our 2002 consolidated results of
operations or financial position

      sfas 143 establishes accounting standards for the recognition and
measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset
retirement cost it also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets sfas 143 is
effective in fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 and we plan to adopt
sfas 143 effective january 1 2003 the impact of sfas 143 on our financial
statements will depend on a variety of factors including interpretative
guidance from the fasb however we do not expect that the adoption will have a
material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

      sfas 144 establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets including discontinued operations sfas 144
superseded statement of financial accounting standards no 121 accounting for
the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of
and apb opinion no 30 reporting the results of operationsreporting the
effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and
infrequently occurring events and transactions the provisions of sfas 144 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 and we intend to
adopt sfas 144 effective january 1 2002 we do not expect that the adoption
will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or
financial position

also economic risks associated with intercompany cash movements when we move
money across different currency markets while our agencies operate in more than
100 countries and invoice clients in more than 70 different currencies our
major international markets are the eu the united kingdom japan brazil and
canada

      we periodically purchase derivative financial instruments as part of
managing our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations derivative financial
instruments are also subject to counterparty risk counterparty risk arises from
the inability of a counterparty to meet its obligations to mitigate
counterparty risk we enter into derivative contracts with major wellknown
banks and financial institutions that have credit ratings at least equal to our
own generally we use forward exchange contracts with maturities ranging up to
90 days to hedge our foreign currency assets and liabilities to a lesser extent
to hedge our net yen investments we have in place several currency and interest
rate swaps with various maturity dates ranging up to five years

      our derivative activities are limited in volume and confined to risk
management activities related to our international operations we have
established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in
interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks we
periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a
valueatrisk computation valueatrisk analysis is a statistical model that
utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the
potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative
financial instruments the valueatrisk analysis we performed on our december
31 2001 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk
of loss was immaterial this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate
remedial action if appropriate

      at december 31 2001 we had numerous forward foreign exchange contracts
outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of 387 million most of which
were denominated in our major international market currencies these contracts
predominantly hedged certain intercompany cash movements which were not recorded
in the respective companys functional currency the terms of these contracts
were generally 90 days or less additionally at december 31 2001 we had
several cross currency interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notational
principal amount of 16300 million yen with maturities up to five years see
note 12 to our consolidated financial statements at pages f20 to f21 of this
report for information about the fair value of each type of derivative

liquidity and capital resources

      liquidity we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 4722 million and
5168 million at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively net cash provided by
our operating activities was 7756 million in 2001 compared to 6859 million
in 2000 our operating cash flows in 2001 which are impacted by our clients
spending patterns reflected revenue and net income growth and an increase in
the cash provided resulting from a decrease in accounts receivable partially
offset by a decrease in cash provided resulting from decreases in accounts
payable and decreases in accrued taxes advance billings and other liabilities
which include accruals for incentive compensation at december 31 2001 and
2000 our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by 14100 million
and 12582 million respectively this occurs primarily because we generally
require payment from our clients before paying vendors for media and other
passthrough expenditures

      net cash flows used in our investing activities in 2001 were 9479
million including 8188 million used for acquisitions net of cash acquired
and 1494 million used for capital expenditures of the 8188 million used for
acquisitions and investments 1568 million related to acquisitions completed
in prior years

      net cash flows from our financing activities in 2001 were 1708 million
including net borrowings of 3547 million and proceeds from option exercise
payments and employee stock purchase plan contributions of 654 million offset
by dividends paid to shareholders of 1357 million repayments of deposits
received from affiliates of 535 million and payments to repurchase stock of
601 million

      capital resources we maintain two revolving credit facilities with two
consortia of banks in the second quarter 2001 we extended our 364day 10
billion revolving credit facility this facility which primarily supports our
issuance of commercial paper was renewed under substantially the same terms as
had previously been in effect including a provision which allows us to convert
all amounts outstanding at its expiration on april 25 2002 into a oneyear term
loan during 2001 we issued 453 billion of commercial paper and we redeemed
459 billion the average term of the commercial paper issued was eight days
at december 31 2001 2696 million of our commercial paper was outstanding at
interest rates ranging from 22 to 27 under the 1 billion credit facility
we also have a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility which expires on
june 30 2003 no borrowings were outstanding under this revolving credit
facility at december 31 2001

      we had shortterm bank loans of 1691 million at december 31 2001
primarily comprised of bank overdrafts by our international subsidiaries which
are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the subsidiaries bank agreements

      in february 2001 we issued 8500 million aggregate principal amount of
zerocoupon notes due 2031 these notes are senior unsecured zerocoupon
securities that are convertible into 77 million common shares implying a
conversion price of 11001 per common share subject to normal antidilution
adjustments these notes are convertible at the specified ratio only upon the
occurrence of certain events including if our common shares trade above certain
levels if we effect extraordinary transactions or if our longterm debt ratings
are downgraded by least three notches from their current level to baa3 or lower
by moodys investors services inc or bbb or lower by standard  poors ratings
services these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number
of shares issuable upon conversion holders of the notes due 2031 have the right
to put the notes back to us for at our election cash stock or a combination
of both in february of each year and we have the right to redeem the notes for
cash beginning in 2006 there are no events that accelerate the noteholders put
rights beginning in february 2006 if the market price of our common shares
exceeds certain thresholds we may be required to pay contingent cash interest
on the notes equal to the amount of dividends that would be paid on the common
shares into which the notes are contingently convertible

      in march 2002 we issued 9000 million aggregate principal amount of
zerocoupon notes due 2032 the notes are senior unsecured zerocoupon
securities that are convertible into 82 million common shares implying a
conversion price of 11001 per common share subject to normal antidilution
adjustments these notes are convertible at the specified ratio only upon the
occurrence of certain events including if our common shares trade above certain
levels if we effect extraordinary transactions or if our longterm debt ratings
are downgraded at least three notches from their current level to baa3 or lower
by moodys investors services inc or bbb or lower by standard  poors ratings
services these events would not however result in an adjustment of the number
of shares issuable upon conversion holders of the notes due 2032 have the right
to put the notes back to us for at our election cash stock or a combination
of both in july of each year beginning in july 2003 and we have the right to
redeem the notes for cash beginning in 2007 there are no events that accelerate
the noteholders put rights beginning in august 2007 if the market price of
our common shares exceeds certain thresholds we may be required to pay
contingent cash interest on the notes equal to the amount of dividends that
would be paid on the common shares into which the notes are contingently
convertible

      on december 31 2001 we redeemed our 2 14 convertibled subordinate
debentures which had a scheduled maturity in 2013 the debentures were
convertible into 46 million common shares prior to redemption substantially
all of the bondholders exercised their conversion rights these debentures were
issued in 1998

      we believe that our operating cash flow combined with our available lines
of credit and our access to the capital markets are sufficient to support our
foreseeable cash requirements including working capital capital expenditures
acquisitions and dividends

      in the normal course of business our agencies enter into various media
commitments on behalf of our clients these commitments are included in our
accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the providers
historically we have not experienced significant losses for media commitments
entered into on behalf of our clients and we believe that we do not have any
substantial exposure to potential losses of this nature in the future

      in addition we have various commitments related to acquisitions completed
in the current and prior years that may require additional future purchase price
payments that would result in additional intangible assets on our balance sheet
these payments are contingent upon the businesses achieving minimum
predetermined performance goals formulas for these contingent future payments
vary from acquisition to acquisition these commitments are not reflected on the
balance sheet because they are highly contingent upon future events the
payments made in 2001 2000 and 1999 for acquisitions completed in prior years
were 1568 million 1839 million and 1370 million respectively

report of independent public accountants

to the board of directors and
  shareholders of omnicom group inc

     we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of omnicom
group inc a new york corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31 2001 and
2000 and the related consolidated statements of income shareholders equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31
2001 these financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the
responsibility of the companys management our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits

     we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the united states those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement an audit includes examining on a test basis
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements an
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion

     in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly
in all material respects the financial position of omnicom group inc and
subsidiaries as of december 31 2001 and 2000 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
december 31 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the united states

     our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole the schedule on page s1 is presented for
purposes of complying with the securities and exchange commissions rules and is
not part of the basic financial statements this schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
and in our opinion fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole

     concentration of credit risk the company provides marketing and corporate
communications services to over 5000 clients who operate in nearly every
industry sector and in more than 100 countries the company grants credit to
qualified clients in the ordinary course of business due to the diversified
nature of the companys client base the company does not believe that we are
exposed to a concentration of credit risk

     derivative financial instruments the company adopted statement financial
accounting standard sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities on january 1 2001 sfas no 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value

     derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through the
consolidated statement of income if the derivative is a hedge depending on the
nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be
offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or
firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of the
change in fair value of a derivative used as a hedge is required to be
immediately recognized in the statement of income

     the companys derivative financial instruments consist principally of
forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate and crosscurrency swaps
for derivative financial instruments to qualify for hedge accounting


                                      f9

                       omnicom group inc and subsidiaries
             notes to consolidated financial statements continued

the following criteria must be met 1 the hedging instrument must be
designated as a hedge 2 the hedged exposure must be specifically identifiable
and expose the company to risk and 3 it must be highly probable that a change
in fair value of the derivative financial instrument and an opposite change in
the fair value of the hedged exposure will have a high degree of correlation

     the majority of the companys derivative activity relates to forward
foreign economic exchange contracts the company executes these contracts in the
same currency as the hedged exposure whereby 100 correlation is achieved based
on spot rates gains and losses on derivative financial instruments which are
hedges of foreign currency assets or liabilities are recorded at market value
and changes in market value are recognized in the statement of income in the
current period gains and losses on derivative financial instruments which are
hedges of net investments are recorded to accumulated comprehensive income as
translation adjustments to the extent of change in the spot exchange rate the
remaining difference is recorded in the statement of income in the current
period derivative financial instruments which do not qualify as hedges are
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and are revalued
to the current market rate and any gains or losses are recorded in the statement
of income in the current period

     use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

     reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the 2001 presentation

2 acquisitions

     during 2001 the company made 39 acquisitions whose aggregate cost in cash
or by issuance of the companys common stock and the assumption of net
liabilities totaled 8447 million including intangible assets of 8391
million valuations of these companies were based on a number of factors
including geographic coverage service offerings competitive position and
reputation

     most of our acquisitions have been relatively small transactions made
consistent with our strategy of building our various agency brands through the
extension of their service capabilities and geographic reach the intangibles
that result from these acquisitions principally result from the purchased
companies knowhow reputation experience and geographic coverage these
intangibles have been amortized on a straightline basis over a period not to
exceed 40 years

     certain acquisitions completed in 2001 and prior years require payments in
future years contingent upon the future performance of the acquired businesses
and their ability to achieve certain predetermined goals formulas for these
contingent future payments vary from acquisition to acquisition included in the
aggregate cost of 8447 million are payments of 1568 million made in 2001
related to acquisitions completed in prior years

      the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value

shortterm investments

      shortterm investments which consist primarily of shortterm investments
and investments in shortterm interest bearing instruments with original
maturity dates between three months and one year are carried at cost which
approximates fair value

other investments

      other investments are carried at cost which approximates fair value the
companys investment in seneca represents 2800 million of the balance at
december 31 2001 refer to note 6 for additional information about this
investment

longterm debt and convertible debentures

      a portion of the companys longterm debt includes floating rate debt the
carrying value of which approximates fair value the companys longterm debt
also includes convertible debentures and fixed rate senior debt the fair value
of these instruments was determined by reference to quotations available in
markets where these issues were traded

financial commitments

      the estimated fair values of derivative positions are based upon
quotations received from independent third party banks and represent the net
amount required to terminate the positions taking into consideration market
rates and counterparty credit risk the fair values of guarantees and letters of
credit are based upon the face value of the underlying instruments

12 financial instruments and market risk

      the company adopted statement financial accounting standard sfas no
133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities on january
1 2001 sfas no 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring
that derivative instruments which meet the sfas 133 definition of a derivative
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value

      derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
earnings if the derivative is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge
changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the
change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments
through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of the change in fair
value of a derivative used as a hedge is required to be immediately recognized
in the companys statement of income

      in the first quarter of 2001 the company recorded a 29 million after
tax charge in earnings 49 million pretax for the cumulative effect of
adopting sfas no 133 the charge resulted from the companys accounting for a
hedge of its net yen investments the company utilized cross currency interest
rate swap contracts to hedge its net yen investments consistent with the
companys policy with respect to derivative instruments and hedging activities
and in accordance with sfas no 133 the company designated the change in yen
spot rates as the hedged risk in its net yen investments since the contract was
a hedge of the yen net investments the change in the fair value of the contract
attributable to changes in spot rates which was the effective portion of the
hedge was recorded as an offset in the cumulative translation account the same
account in which translation gains and losses on the net yen investment are
recorded all other changes in the fair value of the contract were recorded
currently in operating income or expense as ineffectiveness during the first
quarter of 2001 the company replaced the contract with a floating rate cross
currency swap contract as a result minimal ineffectiveness will result for the
remaining term

      the companys derivative activities are limited in volume and confined to
risk management activities related to our international operations the company
has established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of
changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market
risks the company periodically determines the potential loss from market risk
by performing a valueatrisk computation valueatrisk analysis is a
statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate
data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of the companys
existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments the valueatrisk
analysis the company performed on the companys december 31 2001 portfolio of
derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial
counterparty risk arises from the inability of

a counterparty to meet its obligations to mitigate counterparty risk the
company enters into derivative contracts with major wellknown banks and
financial institutions that have credit ratings at least equal to that of the
company this system is designed to enable the company to initiate remedial
action if appropriate

      at december 31 2001 and 2000 the company had japanese yen 16300 million
aggregate notional principal amount of cross currency interest rate swaps with
maturities of up to five years the swaps effectively hedge the companys net
investment in japanese yen denominated assets

      the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to
hedge intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different
currency markets changes in market value of the forward contracts are included
in the income statement and are offset by the corresponding change in value of
the underlying asset or liability being hedged the terms of these contracts are
generally ninety days or less at december 31 2001 and 2000 the aggregate
amount of intercompany receivables and payables subject to this hedge program
was 387 million and 254 million respectively the table below summarizes by
major currency the notional principal amounts of the companys forward foreign
exchange contracts outstanding at december 31 2001 and 2000 the buy amounts
represent the us dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase the respective
currency and the sell amounts represent the us dollar equivalent of
commitments to sell the respective currency refer to note 11 for a discussion

      risks we face risks typical of marketing and corporate communications
services companies and other services businesses generally including risks
arising out of changes in general economic conditions competitive factors
client communication requirements the hiring and retention of human resources
and other factors in addition our international operations are subject to the
risk of currency fluctuations exchange controls and similar risks discussed in
item 7 on page 5 for financial information on our operations by geographic
area see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements at pages f13 to f14
of this report revenue is dependent upon marketing and corporate communication
requirements of clients and tends to be highest in the second and fourth
quarters of the calendar year

      government agencies and consumer groups have directly or indirectly
affected or attempted to affect the scope content and manner of presentation of
advertising we presently believe the total volume of advertising in general
media will not be materially affected by future legislation or regulation
although the scope content and manner of presentation of advertising will
continue to be affected

77a managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
      operations quantitative and qualitative information about market risk

results of operations

      revenue in 2000 our consolidated worldwide revenue increased 200 to
61542 million from 51305 million in 1999 reflecting the growth in both
domestic and international operations described below in 1999 our consolidated
worldwide revenue increased 196 to 51305 million from 42909 million in
1998 these increases reflecting the growth in both our domestic and
international operations described below

      our 2000 domestic revenue increased 286 to 32582 million from
25329 million in 1999 the effect of acquisitions net of divestitures
accounted for a 107 increase the remaining 179 increase was due to net new
business wins and higher net revenue from existing clients our 1999 domestic
revenue increased 207 as compared to 1998 the effect of acquisitions net of
divestitures accounted for 61 increase the remaining 146 increase was due
to net new business wins and higher net revenue from existing clients

      our 2000 international revenue increased 115 to 28960 million from
25976 million in 1999 the effect of acquisitions net of divestitures
accounted for a 71 increase changes in translation of foreign currencies to
the us dollar decreased international revenue by 110 as compared to 1999
driven primarily by decreases in the value of the euro and the british pound
relative to the us dollar the remaining 154 increase was due to net new
business wins and higher net revenue from existing clients our 1999
international revenue increased 184 as compared to 1998 the effect of
acquisitions net of divestitures accounted for a 109 increase in
international revenue changes in the translation of foreign currencies to the
us dollar decreased international revenue by 60 as compared to 1998 the
remaining 135 increase was due to net new business wins and higher net revenue
from existing clients

      operating expenses and net interest expense our 2000 worldwide operating
expenses increased 197 to 52761 million from 44064 million in 1999
primarily as a result of increased operating costs in support of our increased
revenue base net interest expense increased to 765 million from 504 million
in 1999 due principally to increased interest rates and higher average
borrowings as compared to 1999 higher average borrowings related primarily to
acquisitions and share repurchases during the year changes in translation of
foreign currencies to the us dollar decreased worldwide expenses including net
interest expense by 56 as compared to 1999

      our 1999 worldwide operating expenses increased 182 to 44064 million
from 37287 million in 1998 primarily as a result of increased operating
expenses our net interest expense in 1999 increased to 504 million from 404
million in 1998 this increase primarily reflects higher average borrowings
during the year and higher interest rates changes in the translation of foreign
currencies to the us dollar decreased worldwide expenses including net
interest expense by 28 as compared to 1998

      income before income taxes pretax margin and operating margin
operating margin which excludes net interest expense improved to 143 as
compared to 141 in 1999 reflecting improved operating leverage and continued
emphasis on cost controls and corporate purchasing efficiencies additionally
we sold a portion of our investment in razorfish inc in the first quarter of
2000 resulting in a 1100 million pretax gain 638 million after tax
excluding the razorfish gain our pretax margin for the year 2000 was 130
compared to 131 in 1999

      our operating margin increased to 141 in 1999 from 131 in 1998
primarily as a result of improved operating leverage in addition 1998 included
transaction costs incurred by amv our 1999 pretax margin was 131 compared to
122 in 1998

      income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was 405 in 2000
as compared to 406 in 1999 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower
effective tax rates at our international operations partially offset by an
increase in our domestic effective tax rate resulting from a higher marginal tax
rate on the sale of razorfish shares our 1999 consolidated effective tax rate
decreased to 406 from 420 in 1998 the decrease reflects lower international
effective tax rates

      equity in affiliates and minority interests in 2000 equity in affiliates
decreased to 109 million from 154 million in 1999 the decrease resulted
from increased ownership positions in some of our affiliates that resulted in
the subsequent consolidation of their income in our 2000 financial statements
and noncash losses from restructuring actions taken by one of our affiliated
companies


                                       4
page

      in 1999 equity in affiliates decreased to 154 million from 205
million in 1998 primarily as a result of increased ownership positions in some
of our affiliates that resulted in their subsequent consolidation in our 1999
financial statements lower aggregate profits by the remaining affiliate
companies accounted for by the equity method also contributed to the decrease

      the increase in minority interest of 16 million in 2000 and 86 million
in 1999 was primarily due to acquisitions including increased ownership
positions in some of our affiliates that resulted in their subsequent
consolidation and greater earnings by subsidiaries where minority interests are
held by third parties

      earnings per share eps including the gain on sale of razorfish shares
our consolidated net income increased 375 to 4988 million from 3629
million in 1999 and our diluted earnings per share increased 358 to 273
excluding the razorfish gain our net income increased 199 to 435 million and
our diluted eps increased 194 to 240 the effect of translation of foreign
currency to the us dollar on diluted eps was a decrease of 010 per share

      our 1999 consolidated net income increased 301 to 3629 million from
2788 million in 1998 diluted eps increased 280 to 201 from 157 in 1998
the effect of translation of foreign currency to the us dollar on diluted eps
was a decrease of 006 per share

      changes in the translation of foreign currencies to the us dollar
decreased our consolidated net income including razorfish by 37 and 32 in
2000 and 1999 respectively

      quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk our
results of operations are subject to the risk of currency exchange rate
fluctuations related to our international operations this economic risk is
generally limited to the net income of the operations as the revenue and
expenses of the operations are generally denominated in the same currency our
major international markets are the united kingdom euro currency countries
brazil canada and japan we are also subject to interest rate risk on our
commercial paper borrowings in some cases we enter into hedging transactions to
mitigate the risk of adverse currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations

      we periodically purchase derivative financial instruments as part of
managing exposures to currency exchange and market interest rates derivative
financial instruments are subject to market and counterparty risk market risk
is the potential for loss resulting from changes in market conditions we
periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a
valueatrisk computation valueatrisk analysis is a statistical model that
utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the
potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative
financial instruments the valueatrisk analysis we performed on our december
31 2000 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk
of loss was immaterial counterparty risk arises from the inability of a
counterparty to meet its obligations to mitigate counterparty risk we enter
into derivative contracts with major financial institutions that have credit
ratings at least equal to our own

      our derivative activities are limited in volume and confined to risk
management activities related to our worldwide operations we have established a
reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency
exchange rates and other relevant market risks this system is designed to
enable us to initiate remedial action if appropriate and results are
periodically reviewed with our audit committee see note 12 to the consolidated
financial statements on pages f20 to f21 of this report for disclosure of the
fair value of each type of derivative

      at december 31 2000 we had forward foreign exchange contracts
outstanding with an aggregate notional principal amount of 254 million most of
which were denominated in our major international market currencies these
contracts predominantly hedge certain intercompany receivables and payables
which are not recorded in the respective companys functional currency the
terms of these contracts are generally three months or less at december 31
2000 we had japanese yen 163 billion aggregate notional principal amount of
cross currency interest rate swaps the swaps hedge our net investment in
japanese yen denominated assets at december 31 2000 we had no other
derivative contracts outstanding

capital resources and liquidity

      we had cash and cash equivalents totalling 5168 million and 5764
million at december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively net cash provided by our
operating activities was 6859 million in 2000 compared to 9726 million in
1999 reflecting revenue and net income growth offset by a decline in the
increase to accounts

payable and an increase in prepaid expenses related primarily to an increase in
current deferred tax assets our operating cash flows are impacted by the
spending patterns of clients

      cash flows used in our investing activities in 2000 were 10346 million
and included 8843 million used for acquisitions and investments net of cash
acquired and proceeds from sales of investments and 1503 million used for
capital expenditures

      cash flows from our financing activities in 2000 were 2821 million and
included net borrowings of 7315 million and proceeds from employee stock plans
of 500 million offset by dividends paid to shareholders and net loans to
affiliates and minority interests totalling 2623 million and payments to
repurchase stock totalling 2371 million

      in february 2001 we completed the issuance of 850 million aggregate
principal amount of liquid yield option notes lyons due february 7 2031
the net proceeds from the lyons offering were 8302 million the lyons are
unsecured unsubordinated zerocoupon securities that may be converted into our
common shares subject to specified conditions relating to the price of our
common shares the initial conversion price is 11001 per share subject to
antidilutive adjustment we may be required to purchase the lyons after february
7 2002 using at our election cash or common stock or a combination of both
and we have the option of redeeming the lyons after february 7 2006 for cash
in addition we may be obligated to pay contingent cash interest after february
7 2006 if our stock price reaches specified thresholds equal to the amount of
dividends we pay to common shareholders during specified sixmonth periods

      in the fourth quarter of 2000 we redeemed our 4 14 convertible
subordinate debentures which had a scheduled maturity in 2007 the debentures
were convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of 3150 per
share subject to adjustments in certain events prior to redemption
substantially all of the bondholders exercised the conversion rights and 69
million of our common shares were issued the conversion had no impact to
diluted earnings per share for the year these debentures were issued in 1997

      we maintain two revolving credit facilities with consortiums of banks one
facility for 500 million expires june 30 2003 and the other for 1 billion
expires april 26 2001 we have the option at maturity to extend and convert the
1 billion facility to a oneyear term loan we intend to renew this facility
for an additional year and we have notified the banks of our request which we
believe will be accepted under the terms of these facilities we may either
borrow directly or issue commercial paper during 2000 we issued 134 billion
of commercial paper and we redeemed 126 billion of commercial paper the
average term of the commercial paper was 21 days at december 31 2000 8315
million of commercial paper was outstanding at interest rates ranging from 665
to 680

      from time to time we have completed other financings when we have felt
that conditions in the capital markets were favorable information about our
other debt is included in notes 3 and 7 of our notes to consolidated financial
statements at pages f11 and f16 to f17 of this report last year we
increased the amount of securities registered under shelf registration
statements with the sec to 1 billion in the aggregate the shelf filings
provide for the issuance of debt or equity securities from time to time either
directly or in acquisitions

      we believe that our operating cash flow combined with our access to the
capital markets and available lines of credit are sufficient to support our
foreseeable cash requirements including dividends capital expenditures
acquisitions and working capital

                    report of independent public accountants

to the board of directors and
  shareholders of omnicom group inc

      we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of omnicom
group inc a new york corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31 2000 and
1999 and related consolidated statements of income shareholders equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2000
these consolidated financial statements and the schedule referred to below are
the responsibility of the companys management our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our
audits

      we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the united states those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement an audit includes examining on a test basis
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements an
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion

      in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly
in all material respects the financial position of omnicom group inc and
subsidiaries as of december 31 2000 and 1999 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
december 31 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the united states

      our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole the schedule on page s1 is presented for
purposes of complying with the securities and exchange commissions rules and is
not part of the basic financial statements this schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
and in our opinion fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole

arising from swap agreements which qualify as hedges are recognized in income
when the interest is receivable or payable derivative financial instruments
which do not qualify as hedges are revalued to the current market rate and any
gains or losses are recorded in income in the current period

      use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

      the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value

shortterm investments

      shortterm investments which consist primarily of shortterm investments
and investments in shortterm interest bearing instruments with original
maturity dates between three months and one year are carried at cost which
approximates fair value

longterm investments

      longterm investments consist of availableforsale securities primarily
in the companys holdings in marketing and corporate communications companies
that are publicly traded the investments are carried at market value and the
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in shareholders
equity

other investments

      included in deferred charges and other assets are other longterm
investments carried at cost which approximates estimated fair value

longterm debt

      a portion of the companys longterm debt included floating rate debt the
carrying value of which approximates fair value the companys longterm debt
also included convertible subordinated debentures and fixed rate senior debt
the fair value of these instruments was determined by reference to quotations
available in markets where these issues were traded the quotations for the
subordinated debentures primarily reflected the conversion value of the
debentures into the companys common stock

financial commitments

      the estimated fair values of derivative positions are based upon
quotations received from independent third party banks and represent the net
amount required to terminate the position taking into consideration market
rates and counterparty credit risk the fair values of guarantees and letters of
credit were based upon the face value of the underlying instruments

12 financial instruments and market risk

      the company utilizes derivative financial instruments predominantly to
reduce certain market risks to which the company is exposed these market risks
primarily consist of the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on assets
and liabilities of nonus operations and the impact of changes in interest
rates on debt the companys derivative activities are limited in volume and
confined to risk management activities senior management at the company
actively participates in the quantification monitoring and control of all
significant risks a reporting system is in place which evaluates the impact on
the companys earnings resulting from changes in interest rates currency
exchange rates and other relevant market risks this system is structured to
enable senior management to initiate prompt remedial action if appropriate
additionally senior management reports periodically to the audit committee of
the board of directors concerning derivative activities in 1993 the audit
committee established limitations on derivative activities which are reviewed
annually

      at december 31 2000 and 1999 the company had japanese yen 163 billion

that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met special accounting for
qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related
results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires that a company
must formally document designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions
that receive hedge accounting sfas no 133 must be applied to 1 derivative
instruments and 2 certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts
