megatrends strategic growth themes and additional business drivers 

 

during 2021 we unveiled our new “powering a smarter world” strategic plan which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made and will continue to make to capitalize on the longterm growth prospects of generac our enterprise strategy is based on the combination of several key megatrends that we believe will drive several significant strategic growth themes for our business

 

key megatrends 

 

       

strategic growth themes 

 

power quality issues continue to increase  power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness for backup power and have historically influenced demand for generators both in the united states and internationally increased frequency and duration of major power outage events that have a broader impact beyond a localized level increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major outage event for standby generators energy storage systems offer similar resiliency advantages to consumers and can benefit from these same awareness drivers at least for short duration power outages the optional standby market for ci power generation is also driven by power quality issues and the related need for back up power baseline outage activity in each of the past five years has been above the longterm average as climate change has driven an increase in severe weather activity while an aging and underinvested electrical grid infrastructure remains highly vulnerable to such activity additionally rapid growth in renewable power sources such as solar and wind is resulting in increased intermittency of supply further impairing the reliable supply of electricity at a time when demand is starting to increase meaningfully with the electrification of a wide range of consumer and commercial products including transportation hvac systems and other major appliances further in california public safety power shutoff events are taking place whereby public utilities are turning off power supply to their customers under certain circumstances to prevent their transmission equipment from starting wildfires taken together we expect these factors to continue driving increased awareness of the need for backup power and demand for generac’s products within multiple categories

 

 

home standby penetration opportunity is significant  many potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions with only approximately 55 penetration of the addressable market of homes in the united states which we define as singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 125000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2019 american housing survey for the united states we believe there are significant opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market both domestically and internationally we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product lines and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our home standby generators additionally smart grid ready capabilities have the potential to turn an asset previously utilized only in emergency power outage situations into a source of recurring revenue for the homeowner and a contributor to grid stability for utilities and grid operators therefore driving incremental interest in the product category

 

solar storage and monitoring markets developing quickly  during 2019 we entered the rapidly developing energy storage monitoring and management markets with the introduction of pwrcell™ and pwrview™ in 2021 we expanded our capabilities in the residential solar market with the introduction of the pwrmicro a gridinteractive microinverter which is expected to be available in 2022 in addition we believe ecobee’s technologies combined with generac’s product offering will allow us to create a clean efficient and reliable home energy ecosystem and platform that will save homeowners money and help grid operators meet the challenges of an electrical grid under increasing stress by providing solutions to better balance supply and demand we believe the electric utility landscape will undergo significant changes in the decade ahead due to rising utility rates grid instability and power quality issues environmental concerns and the continuing performance and cost improvements in renewable energy and batteries onsite power generation from renewable sources such as solar and wind and cleanerburning natural gas generators is projected to become more prevalent as will the need to monitor manage and store this power – potentially developing into a significant market opportunity we expect to further advance our growing capabilities in clean energy by increasing our product development sourcing distribution and marketing efforts as we leverage our significant competencies in the residential standby generator market to accelerate our market position in the emerging residential solar storage monitoring and management markets

 

grid services and energyasaservice open new revenue streams  we expect the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model toward decarbonized digitized and decentralized solutions will continue to drive the need for grid operators to access and control distributed energy resources ders this will require highly intelligent software platforms that are able to optimize an increasingly complex supply and demand equation such as our concerto software platform as the grid services market matures generac will continue to explore new opportunities beyond the traditional softwareasaservice subscription model including but not limited to the aggregation and sale of power from a fleet of ders in performancebased contracts wholesale power market participation turnkey solutions that combine hardware and software with services and other monitoring and management services additionally growing interest in our products across a variety of residential and ci “beyond standby” applications is driving an increase in demand for subscriptionlike models for end customers in which generac will partner with third parties to deliver peace of mind and resiliency solutions while also enabling contributions to grid stability with minimal upfront capital outlays the significant advancements made in recent years in the connectivity of our products is core to these newer capabilities which play a key role in the evolution of generac into an energy technology solutions company

 

natural gas generators driving strong growth  natural gas will continue to be an important and cleaner transition fuel of the future as the world continues to shift towards lower emission power generation sources demand for natural gas generators continues to represent an increasing portion of the overall ci market which we believe will continue to grow at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators we also continue to explore and expand our capabilities within new gaseous generator market opportunities including continuousduty prime rated distributed generation demand response microgrids and overall use as a distributed energy resource in areas where grid stability is needed many of these applications are made possible by our natural gas generators having smart grid ready capabilities which allows for end users to participate in grid services programs helping to offset the purchase price of the equipment over the product’s lifespan expanding our natural gas product offering into larger power nodes is also a part of this growth theme in taking advantage of the continuing shift from diesel to natural gas generators

 

rollout of 5g will require improved network quality  as the number of “connected” devices continues to rapidly increase and wireless networks are now being considered critical infrastructure in the united states network reliability and uptime are necessary for our increasingly connected society this will require highly resilient cell tower sites across the network and therefore necessitates the need for backup power sources on site at these cell towers generac is the leading supplier of backup power to the telecommunications market in the united states where approximately half of all existing tower sites have yet to be hardened with backup power as more missioncritical data is transmitted over wireless networks we believe this penetration rate must increase considerably to maintain a higher level of reliability across the network increased adoption of highspeed wireless networks around the globe may lead to similar demand trends internationally as growing cell tower density and the need for onsite backup power expand the market opportunity for our international telecom operations we have relationships with key tier 1 carriers and tower companies globally in addition to having the distribution partners to support the global market from a service standpoint we believe these factors coupled with generac’s ability to customize solutions to each customer’s need help us to maintain our strength within the global telecommunications market

 

 

other business drivers 

 

impact of residential investment cycle the market for a number of our residential products is affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income the value of their home and overall net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators and energy storage systems trends in the new housing market highlighted by residential housing starts can also impact demand for these products demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors as well as weather patterns finally the existence of renewable energy mandates investment tax credits and other subsidies can also have an impact on the demand for solar and energy storage systems 

 

impact of business capital investment and other economic cycles   the global market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by different capital investment cycles which can vary across the numerous regions around the world in which we participate these cycles include nonresidential building construction durable goods and infrastructure spending as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil  gas as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends and market conditions can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial retail office telecommunications industrial data centers healthcare construction oil  gas and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions in the countries where we serve as well as credit availability in those regions

 

enterprise strategy 

 

the megatrends and strategic growth themes that we have identified help to inform our new enterprise strategy “powering a smarter world” and our purpose statement “leading the evolution to more resilient efficient and sustainable energy solutions” as we continue to execute our strategic plan into the future we are focused on building out residential and ci ecosystems of connected energy solutions to help address a growing electricity supplydemand imbalance problem by focusing on three key objectives i improve energy resilience and independence ii optimize energy efficiency and consumption and iii protect and build critical infrastructure these objectives are further explained as follows

 

improve energy resilience and independence increase power reliability through onsite generation and storage solutions that provide resiliency for homes businesses and communities

 

homes businesses and communities are experiencing a deterioration in the reliable supply of electricity due to a number of factors including climate change impacts driving more severe and volatile weather leading to increased power outages a legacy power infrastructure that’s still predominantly a oneway system that is capacity constrained given heavy reliance on fossil fuels the power infrastructure still being impaired by underinvestment making it more susceptible to power outages and regulatory and legislative actions implementing penalties for carbon intensity coupled with incentives for adoption of more intermittent renewable power sources our residential and ci product offering begins with power generation and storage products including home standby generators energy storage systems gridinteractive microinverters and natural gas ci generators these onsite generation and storage solutions provide peace of mind and protection against rising power quality issues by delivering energy resilience and independence for end users and their communities in fact our new pwrgenerator that was launched in 2021 is a dc generator that is purpose built to charge our pwrcell energy storage system with this capability an end user could conceivably be completely independent from the grid by using sustainable solar energy to power their home with the pwrgenerator used to recharge the pwrcell should the battery be depleted at certain points of the day importantly many of these onsite solutions come standard as “smart grid ready” capable of participating in grid services programs which provide additional return on investment opportunities for end users while at the same time helping to support grid reliability resiliency and sustainability

 

 

optimize energy efficiency and consumption enable sustainable and more efficient power generation and consumption through monitoring management and lowercarbon solutions

 

coinciding with electricity supply reliability issues are a number of factors expected to drive increasing demand for electricity over the next several years the “electrification of everything” broadly encompasses this global trend including the electrification of transportation via both electric vehicle adoption and expanding charging infrastructure the electrification of the home including hvac systems and other appliances and the electrification of commercial and industrial systems these global electrification trends will require utilities and energy retailers to meaningfully increase their supply and quality of electricity while at the same time working to achieve carbonreduction goals which is expected to contribute to a further supplydemand imbalance and additional power quality issues as part of our expanding ecosystems of energy technology solutions we continue to build out our residential monitoring and management capabilities which improve energy efficiency and optimize consumption by end users this includes recently adding ecobee’s smart home energy management devices apricity’s water heater controllers and tank utility’s propane tank monitoring solutions along with the introduction of our secondgeneration load control device called pwrmanager in the future we expect to simplify and integrate our residential product offering into a single ecosystem leveraging our software development capabilities and the substantial resources brought by the ecobee acquisition this singular systemlevel platform is intended to serve as the user interface for consumers to monitor and manage all of their ders thereby empowering the user to optimize energy efficiency and consumption within our global ci product category we are developing bidirectional natural gas generators and systemlevel microgrid controls that provide the user interface platform for businesses to better optimize their energy efficiency and consumption

 

protect and build critical infrastructure offering innovative solutions that enable and protect nextgeneration power communications transportation and other critical infrastructure

 

the critical power infrastructure around the world is becoming more sensitive to the growing electricity supplydemand imbalance generac’s suite of solutions can be connected and synchronized within the concerto distributed energy resource management system providing utilities and energy retailers the flexibility to access and control these ders in realtime to better manage the escalating complexities of their electrical grids when utilized in these applications our residential and ci ecosystems of ders essentially provide backup power to utilities and energy retailers enabling the adoption of renewable energy sources by helping solve the intermittency challenges presented by renewable power generation we believe the next generation of critical power infrastructure will be decarbonized digitized and decentralized and we view the implementation aggregation and management of distributed energy resources as an important aspect to creating the future “grid 20” additionally the rollout of 5g networks globally and the growing consideration of these wireless networks as critical infrastructure makes our backup power solutions for telecommunications applications essential elements of a wireless network that cannot afford to experience power failure finally our broad offering of global mobile solutions including mobile power products mobile energy storage systems and hybrid generators play a key role in the completion of infrastructure construction projects such as roads highways bridges and airports

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report

  

 

risk factors related to covid19 

  

the duration and scope of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic are uncertain and may continue to adversely affect our operations supply chain distribution and demand for certain of our products and services 

 

the global outbreak of covid19 and related variants has created significant uncertainty within the global markets that we serve we have operations customers and suppliers in countries significantly impacted by covid19 governmental authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of covid19 including travel bans or restrictions increased border controls or closures quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns and such authorities may impose additional restrictions in the future we have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of covid19 within our business there can be no assurance that the measures implemented by governmental authorities or our own actions will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion 

 

the impact of covid19 has resulted in disruptions to our manufacturing operations and supply chain and may continue to do so which could negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand our forwardlooking statements assume that our production facilities supply chain and distribution partners continue to operate during the pandemic to date we have been able to operate the majority of our facilities if we were to encounter a significant work stoppage disruption or outbreak due to covid19 at one or more of our locations or suppliers we may not be able to satisfy customer demand for a period of time

 

furthermore the impact of covid19 on the economy demand for our products and impacts to our operations including the measures taken by governmental authorities to address it may precipitate or exacerbate other risks andor uncertainties including specifically many of the risk factors set forth in this annual report including inflationary costs disruptions due to labor shortages supply chain disruptions and risks related to the fair market value of intangible assets that could lead to an impairment which may have a significant impact on the companys operating results and financial condition although we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time 

 

risk factors related to our business and industry 

 

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials  key components and labor we use to make our products could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum as well as batteries and advanced electronic components we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand commodity prices currencies transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control in fact we have recently seen such trends significantly impact our business resulting in higher costs and shortages in materials components and labor and such impacts may continue for the foreseeable future we typically do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices in the short term we have been unable to fully mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions and if our mitigation efforts continue to not be fully effective in the short or long term our profitability could be adversely affected we have implemented multiple rounds of price increases in 2021 to combat rising input costs however these price increases will be fully realized throughout 2022 as the higher pricing works through backlog also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components it has been challenging to consistently obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of certain required raw materials and components or sufficient labor resources while we ramp up production to meet higher levels of demand and if this trend continues we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose additional sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation

 

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we consider our intellectual property rights to be important assets and seek to protect them through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to resolve and we might not ultimately prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights we currently are and have previously been subject to such third party infringement claims and may continue to be in the future any such claim even if it is believed to be without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements

 

 

we may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to current and future product liability claims alleging to arise from the use of our products and that may purportedly result in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability

 

demand for the majority of our products is significantl y affected by unpredictable power outage activity that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for the majority of our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts public safety power shutoffs and other power grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location frequency and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead and in the past have led to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result and have previously resulted in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the lack of major power outage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of power outage activity are part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have and previously have had an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products

  

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses  and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards have previously led and could lead again to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending has previously had and could again have a material impact on our business we currently do not have any material contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products at the same level if at all if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results including increases in interest rates which could negatively affect overall growth and impact sales of our products additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets also the availability of renewable energy mandates and investment tax credits and other subsidies can have an impact on the demand for energy storage systems our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate such risks or events may disrupt our supply chain and not enable us to produce products to meet customer demand

 

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies which have substantially greater financial resources than we do some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for further information see “item 1—business—competition”

 

our industry is subject to te chnological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

 

new products or refinements and improvements to our existing products may have technical failures delayed introductions higher than expected production costs or may not be well accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected

  

 

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label national  retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

 

we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely on our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large national retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors with whom we do business offer competitors’ products and services impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform including increasing the number of energy storage distributors and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts for further information see “item 1—business—distribution channels and customers”

 

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes or mix of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products the different accounting systems utilized and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume or mix changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales

  

policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

 

changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for example we are experiencing increased tariffs on certain of our products and product components however these tariffs have not ultimately had a material adverse effect on our results due to the implementation of various mitigation efforts in conjunction with our supply chain and end market partners

 

risk factors related to our operations 

  

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the energy products and solutions industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations if we needed to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business if we do not have effective succession plans in place

  

disruptions caused by labor dis putes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position a work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

  

 

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including

 

     

in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius of each other we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations

 

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

 

we singlesource certain types of parts in our product designs delays in our suppliers deliveries have impaired and may continue to impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit logistical challenges labor or material shortages trade restrictions weather events political instability wars terrorism civil unrest disease or natural disasters

 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the integration of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations

  

in addition the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others

 

               

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot be assured that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction

 

 

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include

 

          

these factors have had in the past and are currently having an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition we are experiencing higher logistics costs due to the current challenging supply chain environment

 

risk factors related to legal and regulatory matters 

 

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice s act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows

 

costs associated with lawsuits investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks we currently face risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations and may continue to face such risks in the future we are currently and may in the future be involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design safety manufacture and performance liability contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights tax securities regulatory compliance and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators and we are subject to and may continue to be subject to such investigations and claims including by the cpsc and epa which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period 

 

the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty may arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings or investigations may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims

 

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions noise labeling transport product content product safety and data privacy including standards imposed by the epa carb cpsc and other regulatory agencies around the world also as we increase our connectivity with our products and customers we may be required to comply with additional data privacy and cybersecurity regulations these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent for example recent carb regulations that will prohibit future sales in california of certain small offroad engines may negatively affect the longterm sales of certain products we sell today in that state in addition some cities or municipalities have imposed or are considering limiting natural gas connections to new buildings or imposing additional permitting restrictions which could adversely affect the sales of certain products we sell in such jurisdictions changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign or recall our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions and carbon monoxide typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market we have also recently been and continue to be subject to product recall actions and related applicable regulatory compliance inquiries by regulatory authorities the failure to comply with existing and future regulatory standards or requirements could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve our reputation business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period

 

 

risk factors related to cybersecurity 

  

failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business  

  

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products and services for customers and in our it systems used to run our business further we collect and store sensitive information in our cloudbased data centers and on our networks government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting confidential information and all types of it systems these actors may engage in fraudulent activities theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage or ransomware

 

our it systems our connected products and our confidential information may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs the risk of such attacks may increase as we integrate newly acquired companies or develop new connected products and related software these attacks pose a risk to the security of our products systems and networks and those of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers as well as to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks through board oversight controls due diligence employee training and communication third party intrusion testing system hardening email and web filters regular patching multifactor authentication surveillance encryption and other measures we remain vulnerable to information security threats

 

we have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our thirdparty providers and we have experienced viruses and attacks targeting our it systems and networks such prior events to date have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity despite the precautions we take we have had and could have again an intrusion or infection of our systems or connected products while such intrusions or infections to date have not resulted in the significant disruption of our business or a loss of proprietary or confidential information we cannot guarantee the same for future intrusions or infections similarly an attack on our it systems or connected products could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property a breach of confidential customer or employee information or product failure or misuse any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns as the threats evolve and become more potent we may incur additional costs to secure the products that we sell as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices

 

risk factors related to our capital structure 

  

we hav e indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 2021 we had total indebtedness of 9801 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate based on libor or other base rate in connection with our term loan amendment in december 2019 language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate selected by the administrative agent and the borrower as a replacement to libor the company has worked with its lenders to amend other libor based debt agreements to add a replacement rate if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do our term loan matures on december 13 2026 and our abl facility expires on may 27 2026

  

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

  

our credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including limitations on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests these restrictions set limitations on among other things our ability to

 

          

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants

 

 

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit ou r ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies in the future if we are unable to refinance our credit facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected

“part i item 1 business” of this annual report contains information regarding business drivers including key megatrends and strategic growth themes under the subheading “megatrends strategic growth themes and additional business drivers” 

 

  f actors affecting results of o perations 

 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing cost control and hedging certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following

 

impact of the covid19 pandemic     as the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve we continue to work to ensure employee safety monitor customer demand proactively address supply chain or production challenges and support our communities during this challenging time we manufacture and provide essential products and services to a variety of critical infrastructure customers around the globe and as a result substantially all of our operations and production activities have been operational during the pandemic we have implemented changes in our work practices maintaining a safe working environment for production and office employees at our facilities while enabling other employees to productively work from home

 

the covid19 pandemic has influenced various trends we are currently experiencing involving supply chain and operations constraints while we are deemed an essential critical infrastructure business and our facilities currently remain operational this continues to be a fluid process and subject to change we have experienced and may continue to experience labor shortages and increased employee absences at our production facilities if we were to encounter a significant work stoppage disruption or covid19 outbreak at one or more of our locations or suppliers we may not be able to satisfy customer demand for a period of time additionally the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain and logistics network and we are continually monitoring scheduled material receipts to mitigate any delays to date we have not experienced significant interruptions to our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic but this could be subject to change if one or more of our suppliers can no longer operate in this environment we have maintained business continuity by utilizing safety stock inventory levels and executing air freight strategies we have experienced inbound and outbound logistics delays and increased costs resulting in longer lead times and higher prices to our customers

 

we continue to experience a broadbased increase in demand for residential products specifically home standby generators created by a significant increase in the awareness importance and need for backup power security as people are working learning shopping entertaining and spending more time at home additionally as economic activity continues to recover across the globe we are experiencing a return to growth for our domestic and international ci products

 

the further extent of the impact of covid19 on our business is dependent on future developments including the duration of the pandemic our ability to continue to operate during the pandemic actions taken by domestic and foreign governments to contain the spread of the virus and the related length of its impact on the global economy and our customers refer to the covid19 related risk factor disclosed in item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k

 

effect of commodity currency   component price fluctuations and resource availability industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum along with other components we use in our products as well as changes in labor costs required to produce our products can have a material impact on our results of operations acquisitions in recent years have increased our use of advanced electronics components and battery cells as well as further expanded our commercial and operational presence outside of the united states these international acquisitions along with our existing global supply chain expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and regulatory tariffs that can also have a material impact on our results of operations additionally specifically in 2021 there continue to be significant raw material and other cost pressures ongoing logistics challenges and various supply chain constraints which are resulting in higher input costs and delays for certain of our products that are reducing our margins in 2021 we have implemented multiple price increases throughout the year to help mitigate the impact of rising costs however the full impact of these price increases will not be realized until 2022 as the higher pricing works through backlog

 

we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of any inflationary pressures through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us

 

 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past five years approximately 19 to 22 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 22 to 25 in the second quarter 25 to 28 in the third quarter and 27 to 31 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending primarily on the occurrence timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period the seasonality experienced during a major power outage and for the subsequent quarters following the event will vary relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred 

 

elevated power outage activity and the emergence of the home as a sanctuary trend driven by the covid19 pandemic led to a significant increase in demand for home standby generators this increased demand has resulted in extended lead times for these products as of december 31 2021 and as a result our net sales during 2022 are expected to experience an increasing trend on a quarterly basis as we increase our production capacity for home standby generators throughout the year 

 

factors influencing interest expense  interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements repayments or borrowings of indebtedness and amendments to our credit agreements in connection with our term loan amendment in december 2019 language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate selected by the administrative agent and the borrower as a replacement to libor that would take affect at the time libor ceases additionally as part of our abl facility amendment in may 2021 language was added to the abl facility agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate selected by the administrative agent and the borrower as a replacement to libor that would take affect at the time libor ceases interest expense slightly decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower libor rates partially offset by increased borrowings on our abl facility refer to note 12 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information

 

factors influencing provision for income taxes and cash income taxes paid   on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act which significantly changed how the us taxes corporations since enactment the us treasury department treasury issued several new regulations and other guidance which we have incorporated into our final tax calculations 

 

as of december 31 2021 the taxdeductible goodwill and intangible assets amortization from our acquisition by ccmp capital advisors llc in 2006 were fully amortized as a result beginning in 2022 this tax amortization will no longer exist resulting in a higher cash tax obligation on a goforward basis

the principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process that are sourced are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions we are also impacted by foreign currency fluctuations given our global supply chain there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold

 

in 2021 we have seen a significant increase in commodity costs we have implemented multiple price increases throughout 2021 to help mitigate the impact of these rising commodity costs however the full impact of these price increases will not be realized until 2022 as the higher pricing works through backlog

 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities insurance support personnel depreciation general supplies and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales

the following table sets forth our net sales by product class for the periods indicated

 

  

net sales    the increase in domestic segment sales for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily driven by strong growth in shipments of residential products highlighted by home standby generators in addition pwrcell tm energy storage systems experienced very robust growth as the company continues to expand in the clean energy market this was supplemented by a return to growth for ci products which was led by a substantial increase in shipments for telecom national account customers and ci mobile products compared to the prior year

 

the increase in international segment sales for the year ended december 31 2021 was due to a broadbased increase in market activity primarily in the european and latin american regions that are seeing a sharp increase in demand as end markets recover from the impact of the covid19 pandemic in addition the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency added 685 million of revenue growth

gross profit   gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2021 was 364 compared to 385 for the year ended december 31 2020 the gross profit margin decrease was primarily driven by higher input costs due to rising commodity prices labor logistics and plant startup costs which were partially offset by the early benefits of pricing actions implemented throughout the year and favorable sales mix from higher shipments of home standby generators

 

operating expenses   operating expenses increased 1604 million or 335 as compared to the prior year the increase was primarily driven by additional variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volumes higher employee and marketing costs and the impact of acquisitions and related transaction costs

provision for i ncome tax es  the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were 195 and 222 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to larger deductions related to net stock compensation and net deductible acquisition transaction expenses partially offset by a discrete tax item created by a legislative tax rate change in a foreign jurisdiction which revalued certain deferred tax liabilities 

 

net income attributable to generac holdings inc   net income attributable to generac holdings inc was 5505 million as compared to 3506 million in the prior year period the increase was primarily driven by increased sales volumes and other items noted above

year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 

 

the following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented

 

  

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increased working capital investment and higher income taxes paid in the current year partially offset by higher sales volumes and resulting higher operating earnings in the current year the higher working capital investment was primarily driven by further elevated inventory levels at the end of the year resulting from extended logistics intransit times ongoing supply chain constraints increasing production rates and continued investments in the ramping of our new manufacturing facility in trenton sc

critical accounting policies 

 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect our supplemental information disclosures including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise we make routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property and equipment prepaid expenses product warranties and other reserves management believes our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment business combinations and purchase accounting and income taxes

 

business c ombinations and p urchase a ccounting 

 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions while the ultimate responsibility resides with management for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities including intangible assets tangible longlived assets and contingent consideration acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions the most significant being projected revenue growth rates profit margins forecasted cash flows discount rates and terminal growth rates the initial measurement of contingent consideration and the corresponding liability is evaluated using the monte carlo method for this valuation method management develops projections during the earnout period utilizing various potential payout scenarios probabilities are applied to each potential scenario and the resulting values are discounted using a rate that considers weighted average cost of capital as well as a specific risk premium associated with the riskiness of the earnout itself the related projections and the overall business refer to note 1 “description of business” and note 3 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s business acquisitions

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived i ntangible a ssets 

 

refer to note 2 “summary of accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for the fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 and found no impairment

 

when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing

 

in our october 31 2021 impairment test calculation the latin america reporting unit had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 23 

 

the carrying value of the latin america goodwill was 457 million key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the reporting unit include revenue growth levels that reflect the impact of increasing telecom production for the us market improving profit margins a 3 terminal growth rate and an 114 discount rate the reporting unit’s fair value would approximate its carrying value with a 175 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 150 basis point reduction in the average earnings margin and 100 basis point reduction in the terminal growth rate 

 

as noted above a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include

 

           

if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors the estimate of the fair values may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition

 

 

income t axes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known

 

in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the taxable income in prior carryback years scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment

  

refer to note 15 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s income taxes and income tax positions

 

new accounting standards

nongaap measures 

 

adjusted ebitda 

 

the computation of adjusted ebitda attributable to generac holdings inc is based on the definition of ebitda contained in our credit agreement as amended to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap we provide the computation of adjusted ebitda attributable to the company taking into account certain charges and gains that were recognized during the periods presented 

 

we view adjusted ebitda as a key measure of our performance we present adjusted ebitda not only due to its importance for purposes of our credit agreements but also because it assists us in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis as it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance our management uses adjusted ebitda

 

      

 

we believe adjusted ebitda is used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the company management believes the disclosure of adjusted ebitda offers an additional financial metric that when coupled with results prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and the reconciliation to us gaap results provides a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors for the following reasons

  

    

the adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are provided for under our term loan and abl facility and also are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by our management and board of directors these adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items that

 

    

we explain in more detail in footnotes a through f below why we believe these adjustments are useful in calculating adjusted ebitda as a measure of our operating performance

 

adjusted ebitda does not represent and should not be a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap some of the limitations are

 

       

 

furthermore as noted above one of our uses of adjusted ebitda is as a benchmark for determining elements of compensation for our senior executives at the same time some or all of these senior executives have responsibility for monitoring our financial results generally including the adjustments in calculating adjusted ebitda subject ultimately to review by our board of directors in the context of the boards review of our financial statements while many of the adjustments for example transaction costs and credit facility fees involve mathematical application of items reflected in our financial statements others involve a degree of judgment and discretion while we believe all of these adjustments are appropriate and while the calculations are subject to review by our board of directors in the context of the boards review of our financial statements and certification by our chief financial officer in a compliance certificate provided to the lenders under our term loan and abl facility this discretion may be viewed as an additional limitation on the use of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool

 

because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally

 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda attributable to generac holdings inc

 

  

a represents the following noncash adjustments gainslosses on disposals of assets and gains on certain investments unrealized marktomarket adjustments on commodity contracts and certain foreign currency and purchase accounting related adjustments we believe that adjusting net income for these noncash items is useful for the following reasons

 

    

b represents sharebased compensation expense to account for stock options restricted stock and other stock awards over their respective vesting period

 

c represents the noncash writeoff of original issue discount and deferred financing costs due to voluntary prepayments of term loan debt refer to note 12 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the losses on extinguishment of debt

 

d represents pretax settlement charges related to the termination of the company’s domestic pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2019 refer to note 16 “benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the company’s pension plans

 

e represents transaction costs incurred directly in connection with any investment including business acquisitions as defined in our credit agreement equity issuance or debt issuance or refinancing together with certain fees relating to our senior secured credit facilities such as administrative agent fees and credit facility commitment fees under our term loan and abl facility which we believe to be akin to or associated with interest expense and whose inclusion in adjusted ebitda is therefore similar to the inclusion of interest expense in that calculation

 

f for the yearended december 31 2020 represents severance noncash asset writedowns and other charges to address the impact of the covid19 pandemic and decline in oil prices on demand for ci products these charges represent expenses that are nonrecurring and do not reflect our ongoing operations

 

 

adjusted net income 

 

to further supplement our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap we provide the computation of adjusted net income attributable to the company which is defined as net income before noncontrolling interest and provision for income taxes adjusted for the following items cash income tax expense amortization of intangible assets amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to our debt intangible impairment charges certain transaction costs and other purchase accounting adjustments losses on extinguishment of debt business optimization expenses certain other noncash gains and losses and adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as set forth in the reconciliation table below 

 

we believe adjusted net income is used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our company’s operations management believes the disclosure of adjusted net income offers an additional financial metric that when used in conjunction with us gaap results and the reconciliation to us gaap results provides a more complete understanding of our ongoing results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business

 

the adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by investors and securities analysts similar to the adjusted ebitda reconciliation these adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance or cash flows such as amortization costs transaction costs and writeoffs relating to the retirement of debt we also make adjustments to present cash taxes paid as a result of our favorable tax attributes causing our cash tax rate to be lower than our us gaap tax rate

 

similar to adjusted ebitda adjusted net income does not represent and should not be a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with us gaap adjusted net income has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap some of the limitations are

 

    

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income attributable to generac holdings inc

 

  

a represents transaction costs incurred directly in connection with any investment including business acquisitions as defined in our credit agreement equity issuance or debt issuance or refinancing and certain purchase accounting adjustments

 

b represents gains on certain investments occurring in other than ordinary course as defined in our credit agreement

 

c for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the amount is based on a cash income tax rate of 197 179 and 150 respectively cash income tax expense is based on the projected taxable income and corresponding cash taxes payable for the full year after considering the effects of current and deferred income tax items and is calculated by applying the derived cash tax rate to the period’s pretax income we expect our cash income tax rate to increase after 2021 due to the expiration of the tax shield created by the amortization of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition by ccmp capital advisors llc

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates to reduce the risk from these changes we use financial instruments from time to time we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

 

foreign currency 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as well as operating businesses and supply chains in foreign countries periodically we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with certain foreign currency purchases and sales in the normal course of business contracts typically have maturities of twelve months or less realized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the statements of comprehensive income

 

the following is a summary of the eleven foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december 31 2021 notional amount in thousands

 

   

commodity prices 

 

we are a purchaser of commodities and components manufactured from commodities including steel aluminum copper and others as a result we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process depending on the supplier these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags and calculations to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies or supply chain savings to offset increases in commodity costs

 

in 2021 we have seen a significant increase in commodity costs we have implemented multiple price increases throughout 2021 to help mitigate the impact of these rising commodity costs however the full impact of these price increases will not be realized until 2022 as the higher pricing works through backlog

 

periodically we engage in certain commodity risk management activities to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results these derivatives typically have maturities of less than eighteen months as of december 31 2021 we had no commodity forward contracts outstanding

 

interest rates 

 

as of december 31 2021 all of the outstanding debt under our term loan and abl facility was subject to floating interest rate risk as of december 31 2021 we had the following interest rate swap contracts outstanding notional amount in thousands of us dollars

 

  

in conjunction with the december 2019 amendment to our term loan we also amended the interest swaps to remove the libor floor which resulted in minor reductions to our future dated swap rates at december 31 2021 the fair value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of 21 million even after giving effect to these swaps we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our term loan and abl facility that is not covered by the swaps a hypothetical change in the libor interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed annual cash interest expense by approximately 38 million or without the swaps in place 88 million in 2021

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report

  

 

risk factors related to covid19 

  

the duration and scope of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic are uncertain and may continue to adversely affect our operations supply chain distribution and demand for certain of our products and services 

 

the global outbreak of covid19 has created significant uncertainty within the global markets that we serve we have operations customers and suppliers in countries significantly impacted by covid19 governmental authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of covid19 including travel bans or restrictions increased border controls or closures quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns and such authorities may impose additional restrictions in the future we have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of covid19 within our business there can be no assurance that the measures implemented by governmental authorities or our own actions will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion 

 

the impact of covid19 on the global economy and our customers as well as recent volatility in oil prices has negatively impacted demand for certain of our products and is expected to continue to do so in the future its effects could also result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations and supply chain which could negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand our forwardlooking statements assume that our production facilities supply chain and distribution partners continue to operate during the pandemic to date we have been able to operate the majority of our facilities given our status as an essential operation if we were to encounter a significant work stoppage disruption or outbreak due to covid19 at one or more of our locations or suppliers we may not be able to satisfy customer demand for a period of time

 

furthermore the impact of covid19 on the economy demand for our products and impacts to our operations including the measures taken by governmental authorities to address it may precipitate or exacerbate other risks andor uncertainties including specifically many of the risk factors set forth in this annual report including risks related to the fair market value of intangible assets that could lead to an impairment which may have a significant impact on the companys operating results and financial condition although we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time 

 

risk factors related to our business and industry 

 

demand for the majority of our products is significantl y affected by unpredictable power outage activity that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for the majority of our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts public safety power shutoffs and other power grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location frequency and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the lack of major power outage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of power outage activity are part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products

  

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses  and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products at the same level if at all if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets also the availability of renewable energy mandates and investment tax credits and other subsidies can have an impact on the demand for energy storage systems

  

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials  key components and labor we use to make our products could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand commodity prices currencies transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components or sufficient labor resources while we ramp up production to meet higher levels of demand we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation

 

 

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies which have substantially greater financial resources than we do some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for further information see “item 1—business—competition”

 

our industry is subject to te chnological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

 

new products or refinements and improvements to our existing products may have technical failures delayed introductions higher than expected production costs or may not be well accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected

  

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label national  retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large national retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors with whom we do business offer competitors’ products and services impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform including increasing the number of energy storage distributors and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts for further information see “item 1—business—distribution channels and customers”

  

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we consider our intellectual property rights to be important assets and seek to protect them through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to resolve and we might not ultimately prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements

 

w e may incur costs and liabilities as a result o f product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability

  

 

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes or mix of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products the different accounting systems utilized and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume or mix changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales

  

policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

 

changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for example starting in 2018 and continuing we are experiencing increased tariffs on many of our products and product components although these tariffs did not ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results due to the implementation of various mitigation efforts and temporary exclusions in conjunction with our supply chain and end market partners

 

additionally the united kingdom’s exit from european union eu membership has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations

 

risk factors related to our operations 

  

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business

  

disruptions caused by labor dis putes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position a work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

  

 

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including

 

     

in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius of each other we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations

 

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

 

we singlesource certain types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit logistical challenges trade restrictions weather events disease or natural disasters

 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the integration of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations

  

in addition the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others

 

               

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction

 

 

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include

 

           

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations

 

risk factors related to legal and regulatory matters 

 

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice s act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs we could also be subject to a recall action by regulatory authorities violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims

 

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions noise labeling transport product content and data privacy including standards imposed by the epa carb and other regulatory agencies around the world also as we increase our connectivity with our products and customers we may be required to comply with additional data privacy and cybersecurity regulations these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions and carbon monoxide typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines and requirements failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve

 

 

 

risk factors related to cybersecurity 

  

failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business  

  

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products and services for customers and in our it systems used to run our business further we collect and store sensitive information in our data centers and on our networks government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting confidential information and all types of it systems these actors may engage in fraudulent activities theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage or ransomware

 

our it systems our connected products and our confidential information may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs the risk of such attacks may increase as we integrate newly acquired companies or develop new connected products and related software these attacks pose a risk to the security of our products systems and networks and those of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers as well as to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks through board oversight controls due diligence employee training and communication third party intrusion testing system hardening email and web filters regular patching surveillance encryption and other measures we remain vulnerable to information security threats

 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of our systems or connected products could result in the disruption of our business or a loss of proprietary or confidential information similarly an attack on our it systems or connected products could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property a breach of confidential customer or employee information or product failure or misuse any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns as the threats evolve and become more potent we may incur additional costs to secure the products that we sell as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices

 

risk factors related to our capital structure 

  

we hav e indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 2020 we had total indebtedness of 8852 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate based on libor or other base rate in connection with our term loan amendment in december 2019 language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate selected by the administrative agent and the borrower as a replacement to libor that would take affect at the time libor ceases the company plans to work with its lenders in the near future to amend other libor based debt agreements to add a replacement rate should the use of libor cease if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do

  

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

  

our credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including limitations on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests these restrictions set limitations on among other things our ability to

 

          

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants

 

 

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit ou r ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies in the future if we are unable to refinance our credit facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected

 

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired our net income could be materially adversely affected 

 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain tradenames at december 31 2020 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 9836 million we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of comprehensive income future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances including any of the risk factors noted above a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements refer to the critical accounting policies in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the company’s process for evaluating its goodwill for impairment

the global outbreak of covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 and has negatively affected the global economy disrupted global supply chains and created significant market volatility and uncertainty our management team has been very proactive in addressing the impact of covid19 on our business the situation continues to evolve and we are working to ensure employee safety monitor customer demand proactively address supply chain or production challenges and support our communities during this challenging time we manufacture and provide essential products and services to a variety of critical infrastructure customers around the globe and as a result substantially all of our operations and production activities have todate been operational we have implemented changes in our work practices maintaining a safe working environment for production and office employees at our facilities while enabling other employees to productively work from home

 

the further extent of the impact of covid19 on our business is dependent on future developments including the duration of the pandemic our ability to operate during the pandemic actions taken by domestic and foreign governments to contain the spread of the virus and the related length of its impact on the global economy and our customers

 

demand 

 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty within various global markets that we serve several areas of our business have been and may continue to be negatively impacted in particular our commercial and industrial ci products around the world the decline in oil prices has impacted our ci mobile products demand significantly as national rental customers are deferring their capital spending ci stationary product shipments through our north american distributor channel and our telecom customers have slowed during 2020 due to declines in quoting activity additionally the covid19 pandemic has caused a broadbased sharp drop in global demand for our ci products in our international segment which magnified the slower economic growth and geopolitical headwinds that were already being experienced by our international business given the magnitude of the downturn in demand for ci products we initiated a number of meaningful costcutting actions for this part of our business during the second quarter of 2020 to better align our cost structure with customer demand we are continuing to monitor these negative impacts on our ci product demand closely and may implement additional measures in response

 

with regard to our residential products historical experience and our current year results have shown that demand for residential products can decouple from broader economic trends as these products are largely driven by power outages the aging and underinvested electrical grid in the us continues to be more vulnerable to elevated power outages across the country as the vast majority of us citizens are spending much more time at home due to the pandemic it is becoming more essential to have a backup power strategy especially as homeowners are doing more critical activities like working and learning from home in addition with california emerging as a major market for backup power and our entrance into clean energy these incremental growth drivers have helped to more than offset the impact of lower consumer spending due to covid19

 

supply chain and operations 

 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limits on gatherings quarantines and business shutdowns while we are deemed an essential critical infrastructure business and our facilities currently remain operational this continues to be a fluid process and subject to change we have experienced and may continue to experience increased employee absences at several of our production facilities if we were to encounter a significant work stoppage disruption or covid19 outbreak at one or more of our locations or suppliers we may not be able to satisfy customer demand for a period of time

 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain and we are continually monitoring scheduled material receipts to mitigate any delays to date we have not experienced significant impacts or interruptions to our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic but this could be subject to change if one or more of our suppliers can no longer operate in this environment we have maintained business continuity by utilizing safety stock inventory levels and executing air freight strategies the covid19 pandemic has also impacted the global logistics network although we have experienced inbound and outbound logistics delays and increased costs in moving shipments across several regions the impact to our business thus far has not been significant this could change if freight carriers are delayed or not able to operate

 

liquidity 

 

although the covid19 outbreak has created uncertain market conditions we believe our business model current cash balance projected cash flow generation and availability under our abl credit facility provide us with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position this financial strength allows us notwithstanding unforeseen impacts of the current covid19 pandemic to remain focused on our strategic plan and provides the flexibility to continue to invest in future growth opportunities

 

 

business drivers and operational factors 

 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of business drivers and trends as well as operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations

  

business drivers and t rends 

 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power generation products energy storage systems grid services solutions and other power products by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important drivers and trends affecting our industry including the following

 

key megatrends there are some important megatrends that we believe represent major themes that will drive significant secular growth opportunities across our business over the long term “grid 20” which is the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model includes the decentralization and decarbonization of the grid and a migration toward distributed energy resources that is expected to drive demand for a variety of clean energy and grid services solutions going forward attitudes around global warming and climate change are shifting which includes the expectation of more severe weather driving increased power outage activity natural gas is expected to be a key fuel of the future with the abundance of supply globally leading to increasing demand for natural gas generators in applications beyond standby power the legacy infrastructure is in need of a major investment cycle to rebuild and upgrade aging networks and systems including transportation water and power the wireless telecommunications infrastructure is shifting to the next generation “5g” architecture which will enable new technologies requiring significant improvement in network uptime through backup power solutions 

 

the onset of the covid19 pandemic in early 2020 has led to a new and emerging megatrend that we refer to as “home as a sanctuary” where millions of people are working learning shopping entertaining and in general spending more time at home as working adults spend much more time working from home and schoolage children learning from home they become more sensitive to power outages due to lost productivity these trends combined with ongoing elevated power outage activity has led to a significant increased awareness importance and need for backup power security as a result of spending more time at home homeowners are also investing more into home improvement projects and outdoor project activity which is leading to increased and broadbased demand for home standby generators as well as chore products used in a variety of property maintenance applications

 

increasing penetration opportunity many potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for home standby generators are still only approximately 50 of the addressable market of homes in the united states the decision to purchase backup power for many lightcommercial buildings such as convenience stores restaurants and gas stations is more returnoninvestment driven and as a result these applications have relatively lower penetration rates as compared to buildings used in codedriven or mission critical applications such as hospitals wastewater treatment facilities 911 call centers data centers and certain industrial locations the emergence of lower cost cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators has helped to increase the penetration of standby generators over the past decade in the lightcommercial market in addition the installed base of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure is still increasing due to a variety of factors including the impending rollout of nextgeneration 5g wireless networks enabling new technologies and the growing importance for critical communications being transmitted over wireless networks we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product lines and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators for residential commercial and industrial purposes

 

effect of large scale and baseline power disruptions power disruptions are an important driver of customer awareness for backup power and have historically influenced demand for generators both in the united states and internationally increased frequency and duration of major power outage events that have a broader impact beyond a localized level increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major power outage event for standby generators for example there have been a number of major outage events that occurred over the past decade that drove strong demand for portable and home standby generators and the increased awareness of these products contributed to strong revenue growth in both the year they occurred along with the following subsequent year major power disruptions are unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period in addition there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently across the united states that drive the baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the level of baseline power outage activity occurring across the united states can also fluctuate and may cause our financial results to fluctuate from year to year

 

energy storage and monitoring markets developing quickly   during 2019 we entered the rapidly developing energy storage monitoring and management markets with the acquisitions of pika energy and neurio technologies along with the subsequent introduction of complete energy storage systems  marketed under the names pwrcell™ and pwrview™ we believe the electric utility landscape will undergo significant changes in the decade ahead as a result of rising utility rates grid instability and power quality issues environmental concerns and the continuing performance and cost improvements in renewable energy and batteries onsite power generation from solar wind geothermal and natural gas generators is projected to become more prevalent as will the need to monitor manage and store this power – potentially developing into a significant market opportunity the capabilities provided by pika and neurio have enabled us to bring an efficient and intelligent energysavings solution to the energy storage and monitoring markets which enabled us to quickly ramp shipments for these clean energy solutions during 2020 and we believe will position generac as a key participant going forward although different from the emergency backup power space we believe this market will develop similarly as the home standby generator market has over the past two decades given both products can provide power resiliency to homeowners we expect to further advance our growing capabilities for energy storage systems including product development sourcing distribution and marketing as we leverage our significant competencies in the residential standby generator market to accelerate our market position in the emerging residential energy storage monitoring and management markets

 

california market for backup power increasing   over the past two years utilities in the state of california have executed a number of public safety power shutoff psps events in large portions of their service areas these events were proactive measures to prevent their equipment from potentially causing catastrophic wildfires during the dry and windy season of the year the occurrence of these events along with the utilities warning these actions could continue in the future as they upgrade their transmission and distribution infrastructure have resulted in significant awareness and increased demand for our generators in california where penetration rates of home standby generators still stand at only approximately 1 we have a significant focus on expanding distribution in california and are working together with local regulators inspectors and gas utilities to increase their bandwidth and sense of urgency around approving and providing the infrastructure necessary for home standby and other backup power products our efforts in this part of the country will also be helpful in developing the market for energy storage and monitoring where the installed base of solar and other renewable sources of electricity are some of the highest in the us and the regulatory environment is increasingly mandating renewable energy on new construction applications

  

 

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators and energy storage systems is also affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income the value of their home and overall net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators and energy storage systems trends in the new housing market highlighted by residential housing starts can also impact demand for these products demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors as well as weather precipitation patterns finally the existence of renewable energy mandates and investment tax credits and other subsidies can also have an impact on the demand for energy storage systems

 

impact of business capital investment and other economic cycle s    the global market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by different capital investment cycles which can vary across the numerous regions around the world in which we participate these markets include nonresidential building construction durable goods and infrastructure spending as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil  gas as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial retail office telecommunications industrial data centers healthcare construction oil  gas and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions as well as credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve

  

f actors affecting results of o perations 

 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing cost control and hedging certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following

 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum along with other components we use in our products as well as changes in labor costs required to produce our products can have a material impact on our results of operations acquisitions in recent years have further expanded our commercial and operational presence outside of the united states these international acquisitions along with our existing global supply chain expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and regulatory tariffs that can also have a material impact on our results of operations

 

we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of any inflationary pressures through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us

 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past five years approximately 19 to 21 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 22 to 25 in the second quarter 26 to 28 in the third quarter and 27 to 31 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending primarily on the occurrence timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period the seasonality experienced during a major power outage and for the subsequent quarters following the event will vary relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred 

 

during 2020 elevated power outage activity and the emergence of the home as a sanctuary trend driven by the covid19 pandemic led to a significant increase in demand for home standby generators this increased demand has resulted in extended lead times for these products as of december 31 2020 and as a result our net sales during 2021 are expected to be more levelloaded throughout the year relative to historical seasonal patterns 

 

factors influencing interest expense  interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements repayments or borrowings of indebtedness and amendments to our credit agreements in connection with our term loan amendment in december 2019 language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate selected by the administrative agent and the borrower as a replacement to libor that would take affect at the time libor ceases we plan to work with our lenders in the future to amend other libor based debt agreements to add a replacement rate should the use of libor cease interest expense decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower libor rates and lower outstanding borrowings refer to note 12 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information

 

factors influencing provision for income taxes and cash income taxes paid   on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act which significantly changed how the us taxes corporations since enactment the us treasury department treasury issued several new regulations and other guidance which we have incorporated into our final tax calculations 

 

 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 102 million of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining from our acquisition by ccmp capital advisors llc in 2006 this remaining balance will fully amortize in our 2021 tax return resulting in approximately 26 million of cash tax savings during 2021 beginning in 2022 this tax amortization will no longer exist resulting in a higher cash tax obligation on a goforward basis

 

components of net sales and expenses 

 

net s ales 

 

our net sales primarily consist of product sales to our customers this includes sales of our power generation equipment energy storage systems and other power products to the residential light commercial and industrial markets as well as service parts to our dealer network net sales also include shipping and handling charges billed to customers with the related freight costs included in cost of goods sold additionally we offer other services including extended warranties remote monitoring grid optimization installation and maintenance services however these services accounted for less than two percent of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 refer to note 2 “summary of accounting policies  revenue recognition” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our revenue streams and related revenue recognition accounting policies

 

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 6 of our sales and our top ten customers representing less than 24 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2020

 

costs of goods s old 

 

the principal elements of costs of goods sold are component parts raw materials freight factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised approximately 75 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2020 the principal component parts are engines alternators and batteries we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our generators up to 24kw along with certain liquidcooled natural gas engines we source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our diesel products for certain natural gas engines we source the base engine block and then add a significant amount of value engineering subsystems and other content to the point that we are recognized as the original equipment manufacturer oem of those engines we design and manufacture many of the alternators for our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable high quality suppliers in some cases these relationships are proprietary

 

the principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process that are sourced are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions we are also impacted by foreign currency fluctuations given our global supply chain there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold

 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities insurance support personnel depreciation general supplies support and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales

results of operations 

 

a detailed discussion of the yearoveryear changes from the companys fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 can be found in the managements discussion and analysis section of the companys fiscal 2019 annual report on form 10k filed february 25 2020 

 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated

 

  

 

the following sets forth our reportable segment information for the periods indicated

 

  

  

the following table sets forth our product class information for the periods indicated

 

  

net sales    the increase in domestic segment sales for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to strong growth in shipments of home standby generators and portable generators as elevated outage activity and nationwide stayathome orders heightened consumer awareness of power reliability concerns chore products sold directly to consumers were also strong during the current year as homeowners increased outdoor project activity in addition shipments of the pwrcell™ energy storage system had a strong impact on growth as we expanded our presence in the rapidly developing solarplusstorage market this broadbased residential products growth was partially offset by continued weakness in sales of ci mobile products due to the ongoing impacts from the covid19 pandemic as well as lower shipments of ci products to national telecom customers as compared to a strong prior year comparison

 

the decrease in international segment sales for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by a broadbased sharp drop in global demand caused by the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the ci power generation market in certain key regions of the world which magnified the slower economic growth and geopolitical headwinds already being experienced prior to the pandemic however the yearoveryear decline in the fourth quarter was at a notably lesser rate relative to recent quarters as certain regions are beginning to show signs of recovery 

 

total contribution from nonannualized recent acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2020 was 324 million

 

net income attributable to generac holdings inc   net income attributable to generac holdings inc was 3506 million as compared to 2520 million in the prior year period the current year net income includes 115 million of pretax charges taken in the second quarter of 2020 relating to business optimization restructuring and other costs to address the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the decline in oil prices on end markets for our products the cost reduction actions taken include certain headcount reductions noncash asset writedowns and other charges the charges which primarily relate to ci products consist of 63 million classified within costs of goods sold and 52 million classified within operating expenses 

 

gross profit   gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2020 was 385 compared to 362 for the year ended december 31 2019 the overall increase in gross profit margin reflected a favorable sales mix towards significantly higher shipments of residential products along with a lower mix of ci products the current year period includes the impact of the aforementioned 63 million of charges classified within costs of goods sold 

 

operating expenses   operating expenses increased 530 million or 124 as compared to the prior year the current year period includes the impact of the aforementioned 52 million of charges classified within operating expenses in addition the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volume incremental spend related to clean energy products and the impact of acquisitions higher employee costs and additional intangible amortization these increases were partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses as a result of the restructuring actions initiated in the second quarter of 2020 and an overall reduction in controllable operating expenses

  

other expense the decrease in other expense net was driven by a reduction in interest expense due to lower libor rates and lower outstanding borrowings in the current year as well as a 109 million pretax settlement charge related to the termination of the company’s domestic pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2019 

 

provision for i ncome tax es  the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were 222 and 211 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in the prior year us state income tax expense which did not repeat in the current year as well as higher earnings in the current year which dilute the impact of discrete tax benefits

 

adjusted ebitda   adjusted ebitda is defined in and there is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda attributable to the company in nongaap measures  adjusted ebitda included below in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k adjusted ebitda margins for the domestic segment for the year ended december 31 2020 were 270 of net sales as compared to 246 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 adjusted ebitda margin in the current year benefited from favorable sales mix and higher operating leverage from the significant revenue growth partially offset by the aforementioned higher operating expense investments 

 

adjusted ebitda margins for the international segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2020 were 51 of net sales as compared to 55 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased operating leverage on lower sales volumes was the primary contributor to the margin decline partially offset by lower operating expenses as a result of the restructuring activities initiated in the second quarter of 2020

  

adjusted net income    adjusted net income is defined in and there is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income attributable to the company in nongaap measures  adjusted net income included below in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k adjusted net income of 4122 million for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 297 from 3178 million for the year ended december 31 2019 due to the factors outlined above together with an increase in the cash income tax rate from 150 in 2019 to 179 in 2020

 

 

liquidity and financial position 

 

our primary cash requirements include payment for our raw material and component supplies salaries  benefits facility and lease costs operating expenses interest and principal payments on our debt and capital expenditures we finance our operations primarily through cash flow generated from operations and if necessary borrowings under our abl credit facility abl facility

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect our supplemental information disclosures including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise we make routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property and equipment prepaid expenses product warranties and other reserves management believes our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment business combinations and purchase accounting and income taxes

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived i ntangible a ssets 

 

refer to note 2 “summary of accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for the fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 and found no impairment

 

when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing

 

in our october 31 2020 impairment test calculation the latin america reporting unit and the generac mobile products reporting unit each had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 

 

the carrying value of the latin america goodwill was 436 million key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the reporting unit include revenue growth levels that reflect the impact of the covid19 pandemic with an eventual return to normalized revenue growth patterns and profitability from recovering end markets improving profit margins a 3 terminal growth rate and an 117 discount rate the reporting unit’s fair value would approximate its carrying value with a 70 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 75 basis point reduction in the sales continuous annual growth rate and terminal growth rate 

 

the carrying value of the generac mobile products goodwill was 486 million key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the reporting unit include revenue growth levels that reflect the impact of the covid19 pandemic as well as the impact of a decline in oil prices on end markets with an eventual return to normalized revenue growth levels from recovering end markets improving profit margins a 3 terminal growth rate and a 146 discount rate the reporting unit’s fair value would approximate its carrying value with a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 100 basis point reduction in the sales continuous annual growth rate and terminal growth rate 

 

as noted above a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include

 

           

if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors the estimate of the fair values may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition

 

 

business c ombinations and p urchase a ccounting 

 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions while the ultimate responsibility resides with management for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities including intangible assets and tangible longlived assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions the most significant being projected revenue growth rates profit margins forecasted cash flows discount rates and terminal growth rates refer to note 1 “description of business” and note 3 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s business acquisitions

 

income t axes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known

 

in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the taxable income in prior carryback years scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment

  

refer to note 15 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s income taxes

 

new accounting standards 

  

for information with respect to new accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 2 “summary of accounting policies  new accounting pronouncements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 

nongaap measures 

 

adjusted ebitda 

 

the computation of adjusted ebitda attributable to generac holdings inc is based on the definition of ebitda contained in our credit agreement as amended to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap we provide the computation of adjusted ebitda attributable to the company taking into account certain charges and gains that were recognized during the periods presented 

 

we view adjusted ebitda as a key measure of our performance we present adjusted ebitda not only due to its importance for purposes of our credit agreements but also because it assists us in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis as it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance our management uses adjusted ebitda

 

      

 

we believe adjusted ebitda is used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the company management believes the disclosure of adjusted ebitda offers an additional financial metric that when coupled with results prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and the reconciliation to us gaap results provides a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors for the following reasons

  

    

the adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are provided for under our term loan and abl facility and also are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by our management and board of directors these adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items that

 

    

we explain in more detail in footnotes a through g below why we believe these adjustments are useful in calculating adjusted ebitda as a measure of our operating performance

 

adjusted ebitda does not represent and should not be a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap some of the limitations are

 

       

 

furthermore as noted above one of our uses of adjusted ebitda is as a benchmark for determining elements of compensation for our senior executives at the same time some or all of these senior executives have responsibility for monitoring our financial results generally including the adjustments in calculating adjusted ebitda subject ultimately to review by our board of directors in the context of the boards review of our financial statements while many of the adjustments for example transaction costs and credit facility fees involve mathematical application of items reflected in our financial statements others involve a degree of judgment and discretion while we believe all of these adjustments are appropriate and while the calculations are subject to review by our board of directors in the context of the boards review of our financial statements and certification by our chief financial officer in a compliance certificate provided to the lenders under our term loan and abl facility this discretion may be viewed as an additional limitation on the use of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool

 

because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally

 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda attributable to generac holdings inc

 

  

a includes the noncontrolling interests’ share of expenses related to pramac purchase accounting including intangible amortization of 43 million 42 million and 46 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

 

b represents the following noncash adjustments gainslosses on disposal of assets unrealized marktomarket adjustments on commodity contracts transactional foreign currency gainslosses and certain purchase accounting related adjustments we believe that adjusting net income for these noncash items is useful for the following reasons

 

    

c represents sharebased compensation expense to account for stock options restricted stock and other stock awards over their respective vesting period

 

d represents the noncash writeoff of original issue discount and deferred financing costs due to voluntary prepayments of term loan debt refer to note 12 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the losses on extinguishment of debt

 

e represents pretax settlement charges related to the termination of the company’s domestic pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2019 refer to note 16 “benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the company’s pension plans

 

f represents transaction costs incurred directly in connection with any investment as defined in our credit agreement equity issuance or debt issuance or refinancing together with certain fees relating to our senior secured credit facilities such as administrative agent fees and credit facility commitment fees under our term loan and abl facility which we believe to be akin to or associated with interest expense and whose inclusion in adjusted ebitda is therefore similar to the inclusion of interest expense in that calculation

 

g typically represents severance and nonrecurring plant consolidation costs for the yearended december 31 2020 represents severance noncash asset writedowns and other charges to address the impact of the covid19 pandemic and decline in oil prices on demand for ci products these charges represent expenses that are nonrecurring and do not reflect our ongoing operations

 

 

adjusted net income 

 

to further supplement our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap we provide the computation of adjusted net income attributable to the company which is defined as net income before noncontrolling interest and provision for income taxes adjusted for the following items cash income tax expense amortization of intangible assets amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to our debt intangible impairment charges certain transaction costs and other purchase accounting adjustments losses on extinguishment of debt business optimization expenses certain other noncash gains and losses and adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as set forth in the reconciliation table below 

 

we believe adjusted net income is used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our company’s operations management believes the disclosure of adjusted net income offers an additional financial metric that when used in conjunction with us gaap results and the reconciliation to us gaap results provides a more complete understanding of our ongoing results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business

 

the adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by investors and securities analysts similar to the adjusted ebitda reconciliation these adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance or cash flows such as amortization costs transaction costs and writeoffs relating to the retirement of debt we also make adjustments to present cash taxes paid as a result of our favorable tax attributes causing our cash tax rate to be lower than our us gaap tax rate

 

similar to adjusted ebitda adjusted net income does not represent and should not be a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with us gaap adjusted net income has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap some of the limitations are

 

    

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income attributable to generac holdings inc

 

  

a represents transaction costs incurred directly in connection with any investment as defined in our credit agreement equity issuance or debt issuance or refinancing and certain purchase accounting adjustments

 

b for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the amount is based on a cash income tax rate of 179 150 and 151 respectively cash income tax expense is based on the projected taxable income and corresponding cash taxes payable for the full year after considering the effects of current and deferred income tax items and is calculated by applying the derived cash tax rate to the period’s pretax income 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates to reduce the risk from these changes we use financial instruments from time to time we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

business strategy 

we have been executing on our strategic plan which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made to capitalize on the longterm growth prospects of generac our strategic plan centers around a number of key megatrends that we believe will drive significant secular growth opportunities for our business significant changes in the energy landscape climate change the abundance of natural gas globally an aging infrastructure and 5g telecommunications are all major themes that we believe will drive future longterm growth as we continue to move our strategic plan into the future we are focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the following four key objectives which are called “powering our future”

 

growing the residential standby generator market as the leader in the home standby generator market it is incumbent upon us to continue to drive growth and increase the penetration rate of these products in households across the world central to this strategy is to increase the awareness availability and affordability of home standby generators ongoing power outage activity due to more severe weather and an aging electrical grid combined with expanding and developing our residentiallight commercial dealer base and overall distribution in affected regions are key drivers in elevating the awareness of home standby generators over the long term we intend to continue to supplement these key growth drivers by focusing on a variety of strategic initiatives targeted toward generating more sales leads improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of a home standby system in addition we intend to continue to focus on innovation in this growing product category and introduce new products and solutions into the marketplace with only approximately 475 penetration of the addressable market of homes in the united states which we define as singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 125000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2017 american housing survey for the united states we believe there are opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market both domestically and internationally as the energy landscape continues to change and favor onsite renewable power we intend to leverage our significant experience and competencies developed over the past two decades in growing the residential standby generator market to accelerate our recent entrance into the emerging residential energy storage and monitoring markets

 

gaining market share and entering new markets  we continue to put a strong focus on improving our share of the power equipment markets in which we participate around the world by emphasizing our innovation and continually expanding our product lines and services we design and build a wide range of products from portable stationary and mobile generators light towers mobile heaters pumps brush mowers and trimmers and other engine powered equipment we have many advantages over our competitors with strengths in our engineering sourcing and operations capabilities as well as a global distribution network that we believe can be leveraged further for continued market share gains in the markets we serve around the world we are also focused on expanding our addressable market opportunities by entering new markets be it with new products or new geographies around the world

 

lead with natural gas power generation products we will attempt to gain incremental market share within commercial and industrial markets through our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fueled standby power solutions while still a smaller portion of the overall ci market we believe demand for these products continues to increase at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators as a result of their lower capital investment and operating costs given the abundance of natural gas as a global source for baseload power we also intend to explore new gaseous generator related market opportunities including increasing our product capabilities for applications beyond standby generation including continuousduty prime rated distributed generation demand response and combined heat and power we plan to do this by leveraging our deep technical capabilities for gaseousfueled products leading position for natural gas standby generators and growing market acceptance for these products as part of this strategy we plan to continue to expand our natural gas product offering into larger power nodes to take advantage of the continuing shift from diesel to natural gas generators

 

connect with customers partners and product we will work to diversify our business model from solely “equipment centric” to a systems and services provider through connectivity solutions and subscription based applications deployed enterprise wide this includes an important emphasis on improving the enduser experience and helping customers to lower utility costs the initial focus is increasing connection with our products to unlock opportunities and revenue streams we have developed tools and programs that add value to dealers and endusers that will result in recurring revenue from subscriptions and parts we will leverage data obtained from connected devices by developing predictive analytics that result in continuously improving product quality sales processes and tools energy optimization aftermarket penetration customer experience and alignment with dealers finally we will build or acquire energy management capabilities to monetize an ecosystem of devices that relate to energy use storage generation control and optimization

 

expansion globally is a core piece to the success of each of our strategic objectives the recent acquisitions that now comprise our international segment have significantly increased our global presence by adding product manufacturing and distribution capabilities that serve local markets around the world and have resulted in us becoming a leading global player in the markets for backup power and mobile power equipment as we look forward we intend to leverage our increased international footprint attained from these acquisitions to serve the significant global markets for power generation and power storage outside the us and canada

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report

  

 

risk factors related to our business and industry 

  

demand for the majority of our products is significantl y affected by unpredictable power outage activity that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for the majority of our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts public safety power shutoffs and other power grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location frequency and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the lack of major power outage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of power outage activity are part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products

  

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses  and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products at the same level if at all if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets also the availability of renewable energy mandates and investment tax credits and other subsidies can have an impact on the demand for energy storage systems

  

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials  key components and labor we use could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand commodity prices currencies transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components including diesel engines if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components or sufficient labor resources we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation for example in december 2019 a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan china resulting in temporary closures or production delays at certain of our suppliers at this point the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain

  

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies which have substantially greater financial resources than we do some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for further information see “item 1—business—competition”

  

 

our industry is subject to te chnological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

 

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures delayed introductions higher than expected production costs or may not be well accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected

  

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label national  retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large national retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors with whom we do business offer competitors’ products and services impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform including increasing the number of energy storage distributors and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts for further information see “item 1—business—distribution channels and customers”

  

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we consider our intellectual property rights to be important assets and seek to protect them through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to resolve and we might not ultimately prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs we could also be subject to a recall action by regulatory authorities violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims

  

 

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions noise labeling transport product content and data privacy including standards imposed by the epa carb and other regulatory agencies around the world also as we increase our connectivity with our products and customers we may be required to comply with additional data privacy and cybersecurity regulations these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions and carbon monoxide typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines and requirements failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve

  

w e may incur costs and liabilities as a result o f product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability

  

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business

  

disruptions caused by labor dis putes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position a work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

  

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including

 

     

 

in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius of each other we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations

 

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include

 

           

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations

 

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

 

we singlesource certain types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit logistical challenges weather events or natural disasters

  

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice s act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows

  

policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

 

changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for example starting in 2018 and continuing through 2019 we experienced increased tariffs on many of our products and product components although these tariffs did not ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results due to the implementation of various mitigation efforts in conjunction with our supply chain and end market partners

 

additionally the united kingdom’s exit from eu membership and discussions regarding its exit from the eu have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations

  

 

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired our net income could be materially adversely affected 

 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain tradenames at december 31 2019 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 9336 million we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of comprehensive income future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements refer to the critical accounting policies in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the company’s process for evaluating its goodwill for impairment

  

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes or mix of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products the different accounting systems utilized and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume or mix changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the integration of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations

  

in addition the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others

 

                

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction

  

we may encounter difficulties in operating or implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system across our subsidiaries  which may adversely affect our operations and financial reporting 

 

over the past four years we have implemented a new erp system for a majority of our business as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and strengthen our operational and financial processes and our reporting systems we expect to implement the new erp system at our other locations in future years the erp system may not provide the benefits anticipated could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and may impact our ability to process transactions efficiently all of which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations

  

failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business  

  

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products and services for customers and in our it systems further we collect and store sensitive information in our data centers and on our networks government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting confidential information and all types of it systems these actors may engage in fraudulent activities theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage

 

our it systems our connected products and our confidential information may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs the risk of such attacks may increase as we integrate newly acquired companies or develop new connected products and related software these attacks pose a risk to the security of our products systems and networks and those of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers as well as to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks through board oversight controls due diligence employee training and communication third party intrusion testing system hardening email and web filters regular patching surveillance encryption and other measures we remain vulnerable to information security threats

 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of our systems or connected products could result in the disruption of our business or a loss of proprietary or confidential information similarly an attack on our it systems or connected products could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property a breach of confidential customer or employee information or product failure or misuse any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns as the threats evolve and become more potent we may incur additional costs to secure the products that we sell as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices

 

certain current favorable tax attributes may no longer be realized in the future resulting in less cash on hand available to invest in other business activities 

 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 225 million of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining from our acquisition by ccmp capital advisors llc in 2006 that we expect to generate aggregate cash tax savings of approximately 57 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability of our us business and a combined federal and state tax rate of 253 the recognition of the tax benefit associated with these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually in 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 31 million in 2020 and 26 million in 2021 based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2021 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes after which our cash tax obligation will increase other domestic acquisitions have resulted in additional tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets that will generate tax savings but are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements

 

risks related to our common stock 

  

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material

  

 

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws

 

     

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

  

we do not have plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

  

we currently do not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock we intend to use future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business as well as for repayment of outstanding debt acquisitions and for share repurchases in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future while we may change this policy at some point in the future we cannot assure you that we will make such a change

  

risks related to our capital structure 

  

we hav e indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 2019 we had total indebtedness of 8989 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate based on libor or other base rate in connection with our term loan amendment in december 2019 language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate selected by the administrative agent and the borrower as a replacement to libor that would take affect at the time libor ceases the company plans to work with its lenders in the near future to amend other libor based debt agreements to add a replacement rate should the use of libor cease if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do

  

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants

  

 

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit ou r ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies in the future if we are unable to refinance our credit facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected

overview 

 

we are a leading global designer and manufacturer of a wide range of energy technology solutions the company provides power generation equipment energy storage systems and other power products serving the residential light commercial and industrial markets power generation is a key focus which differentiates us from our main competitors that also have broad operations outside of the power equipment market as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the power equipment market in north america and an expanding presence internationally we believe we have one of the widest ranges of products in the marketplace including residential commercial and industrial standby generators as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications a key strategic focus for the company in recent years has been leveraging our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fueled generators to expand into applications beyond standby power we have also been focused on “connecting” the equipment we manufacture to the users of that equipment helping to drive additional value to our customers and our distribution partners over the product lifecycle other power products that we design and manufacture include light towers which provide temporary lighting for various end markets commercial and industrial mobile heaters and pumps used in the oil  gas construction and other industrial markets and a broad product line of outdoor power equipment for residential and commercial use during 2019 we began providing energy storage systems as a clean energy solution for residential use that capture and store electricity from solar panels or other power sources and help reduce home energy costs while also protecting homes from brief power outages

  

 

business drivers and operational factors 

 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of business drivers and trends as well as operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations

  

business drivers and t rends 

 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power generation products energy storage systems and other power products by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important drivers and trends affecting our industry including the following

 

increasing penetration opportunity many potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for home standby generators are only approximately 475 of the addressable market of homes in the united states the decision to purchase backup power for many lightcommercial buildings such as convenience stores restaurants and gas stations is more returnoninvestment driven and as a result these applications have relatively lower penetration rates as compared to buildings used in codedriven or mission critical applications such as hospitals wastewater treatment facilities 911 call centers data centers and certain industrial locations the emergence of lower cost cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators has helped to increase the penetration of standby generators over the past decade in the lightcommercial market in addition the installed base of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure is still increasing due to a variety of factors including the impending rollout of nextgeneration 5g wireless networks enabling new technologies and the growing importance for critical communications and other uninterrupted voice and data services we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product lines and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators for residential commercial and industrial purposes

 

effect of large scale and baseline power disruptions power disruptions are an important driver of customer awareness for backup power and have historically influenced demand for generators both in the united states and internationally increased frequency and duration of major power outage events that have a broader impact beyond a localized level increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major power outage event for standby generators for example the major outage events that occurred during the second half of 2017 drove strong demand for portable and home standby generators and the increased awareness of these products contributed to strong revenue growth in both 2017 and 2018 major power disruptions are unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period in addition there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently across the united states that drive the baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the level of baseline power outage activity occurring across the united states can also fluctuate and may cause our financial results to fluctuate from year to year

 

energy storage and monitoring markets developing quickly   during 2019 we entered the rapidly developing energy storage and monitoring markets with the acquisitions of pika energy and neurio technologies we believe the electric power landscape will undergo significant changes in the decade ahead as a result of rising utility rates grid instability and power utility quality issues environmental concerns and the continuing performance and cost improvements in renewable energy and batteries onsite power generation from solar wind geothermal and natural gas generators is projected to become more prevalent as will the need to manage monitor and store this power – potentially developing into a significant market opportunity annually the capabilities provided by pika and neurio have enabled us to bring an efficient and intelligent energysavings solution to the energy storage and monitoring markets which we believe will position generac as a key participant going forward although very different from the emergency backup power space we serve today we believe this market will develop similarly as the home standby generator market has over the past two decades our efforts to develop a costeffective global supply chain omnichannel distribution targeted consumerbased marketing content and proprietary inhome sales tools have played a critical role in creating the market for home standby generators and we intend to leverage our expertise and capabilities in these areas as we work to grow the energy storage and monitoring markets

 

california market for backup power increasing during 2019 the largest utility in the state of california along with other utilities announced their intention and ultimately executed a number of public safety power shutoff psps events in large portions of their service areas these events were proactive measures to prevent their equipment from potentially causing catastrophic wildfires during the dry and windy season of the year the occurrence of these events along with the utilities warning these actions could continue in the future as they upgrade their transmission and distribution infrastructure have resulted in significant awareness and increased demand for our generators in california where penetration rates of home standby generators stand at approximately 1 we have a significant focus on expanding distribution in california and are working together with local regulators inspectors and gas utilities to increase their bandwidth and sense of urgency around approving and providing the infrastructure necessary for home standby and other backup power products our efforts in this part of the country will also be helpful in developing the market for energy storage and monitoring where the installed base of solar and other renewable sources of electricity are some of the highest in the us and the regulatory environment is mandating renewable energy on new construction starting in 2020

  

 

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators and energy storage systems is also affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income the value of their home and overall net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators and energy storage systems trends in the new housing market highlighted by residential housing starts can also impact demand for these products demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors as well as weather precipitation patterns finally the existence of renewable energy mandates and investment tax credits and other subsidies can also have an impact on the demand for energy storage systems

 

impact of business capital investment and other economic cycle s    the global market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by different capital investment cycles which can vary across the numerous regions around the world in which we participate these markets include nonresidential building construction durable goods and infrastructure spending as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil  gas as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial retail office telecommunications industrial data centers healthcare construction oil  gas and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions as well as credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve in addition we believe demand for our mobile power products will continue to benefit from a secular shift towards renting versus buying this type of equipment

  

f actors affecting results of o perations 

 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing cost control and hedging certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following

 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum along with other components we use in our products as well as changes in labor costs required to produce our products can have a material impact on our results of operations acquisitions in recent years have further expanded our commercial and operational presence outside of the united states these international acquisitions along with our existing global supply chain expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and regulatory tariffs that can also have a material impact on our results of operations

 

we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of any inflationary pressures through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us

 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past five years approximately 20 to 24 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 22 to 25 in the second quarter 26 to 28 in the third quarter and 27 to 29 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the occurrence timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period the seasonality experienced during a major power outage and for the subsequent quarters following the event will vary relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred we maintain a flexible production and supply chain infrastructure in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand

 

factors influencing interest expense and cash interest expense  interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements repayments or borrowings of indebtedness and amendments to our credit agreements in connection with our term loan amendment in december 2019 language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate selected by the administrative agent and the borrower as a replacement to libor that would take affect at the time libor ceases we plan to work with our lenders in the future to amend other libor based debt agreements to add a replacement rate should the use of libor cease interest expense increased slightly during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased borrowings by our foreign subsidiaries refer to note 12 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information

 

factors influencing provision for income taxes and cash income taxes paid   on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which significantly changed how the us taxes corporations during 2018 the us treasury department treasury issued several new regulations and other guidance which we have incorporated into our final tax calculations at december 31 2019 we consider the tax expense recorded for the impact of tax reform to be complete it is possible additional regulations or guidance could be issued by treasury or by a state which may create an additional tax expense or benefit we will update our future tax provisions based on new regulations or guidance accordingly

 

 

as a result of the tax act we recognized a onetime noncash benefit of 284 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily from the impact of the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities this noncash benefit resulted primarily from the federal rate reduction from 35 to 21

 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 225 million of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining from our acquisition by ccmp capital advisors llc in 2006 that we expect to generate aggregate cash tax savings of approximately 57 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability of our us business and a combined federal and state tax rate of 253 the recognition of the tax benefit associated with these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million in 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 31 million in 2020 and 26 million in 2021 based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2021 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes after which our cash tax obligation will increase other domestic acquisitions have resulted in additional tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets that will generate tax savings but are not material to our consolidated financial statements

 

components of net sales and expenses 

 

net s ales 

 

our net sales primarily consist of product sales to our customers this includes sales of our power generation equipment energy storage systems and other power products to the residential light commercial and industrial markets as well as service parts to our dealer network net sales also include shipping and handling charges billed to customers with the related freight costs included in cost of goods sold additionally we offer other services including extended warranties remote monitoring installation and maintenance services however these services accounted for less than three percent of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 refer to note 2 “significant accounting policies  revenue recognition” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our revenue streams and related revenue recognition accounting policies

 

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 5 of our sales and our top ten customers representing less than 19 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2019

 

costs of goods s old 

 

the principal elements of costs of goods sold are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised approximately 75 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2019 the principal component parts are engines alternators and batteries we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our generators up to 22kw along with certain liquidcooled natural gas engines we source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our diesel products for certain natural gas engines we source the base engine block and then add a significant amount of value engineering subsystems and other content to the point that we are recognized as the oem of those engines we design and manufacture many of the alternators for our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable high quality suppliers in some cases these relationships are proprietary

 

the principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process that are sourced are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions we are also impacted by foreign currency fluctuations given our global supply chain there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold

 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies support and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales

 

operating e xpenses 

 

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our sales marketing distribution service parts engineering information systems human resources accounting finance risk management legal and tax functions among others these expenses include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs taxes and sharebased compensation cost and are classified into three categories selling and service research and development and general and administrative additionally the amortization expense related to our finitelived intangible assets is included within operating expenses

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated

 

  

 

the following sets forth our reportable segment information for the periods indicated

 

  

  

the following table sets forth our product class information for the periods indicated

 

  

  

net sales    the increase in domestic segment sales for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to strong shipments of home standby generators due to increased trends of power outage activity across the us and canada inclusive of public utility power shutoffs in california in addition ci stationary generator shipments were also strong particularly for natural gas and telecom applications the pika and neurio acquisitions provided a modest contribution of sales in 2019 given their startup nature the overall domestic segment sales growth was partially offset by lower shipments of portable generators and ci mobile products

 

the slight increase in international segment sales for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to contributions from the selmec and captiva acquisitions international segment sales in 2019 were impacted by the unfavorable results of foreign currency and geopolitical headwinds that caused economic softness in certain key regions of the world in which we operate

 

total contribution from nonannualized recent acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2019 was 361 million

 

gross profit   gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2019 was 362 compared to 358 for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase reflected a favorable sales mix towards higher margin home standby generators and price increases implemented since the prior period these items were partially offset by the impact of recent acquisitions and the realization of higher input costs including regulatory tariffs logistics costs and labor rates

 

operating expenses   the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by incremental variable operating expense on the strong sales growth recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions an increase in employee headcount related to strategic initiatives higher marketing and promotional spend and higher intangible amortization expenses

  

other expense the increase in other expense net was primarily due to a 109 million pretax settlement charge related to the termination of the company’s domestic pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2019 partially offset by more favorable foreign currency adjustments compared to the prior year 

 

provision for i ncome tax es  the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were 211 and 225 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in the us state income tax expense and lower foreign earnings which are subject to higher jurisdictional tax rates

 

net income attributable to generac holdings inc the increase in net income attributable to generac holdings inc was primarily due to the factors outlined above

 

adjusted ebitda   adjusted ebitda margins for the domestic segment for the year ended december 31 2019 were 246 of net sales as compared to 248 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2018 adjusted ebitda margin in the current year benefited from favorable sales mix pricing initiatives and fixed operating cost leverage on the higher sales volumes these favorable impacts were more than offset by higher input costs including regulatory tariffs increased employee headcount higher marketing and promotional spend and recurring operating expenses from recent acquisitions

the following table sets forth our product class information for the periods indicated

 

   

net sales  the increase in domestic sales for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to strong broadbased growth in shipments of home standby generators portable generators outdoor power equipment and service parts shipments of residential products were particularly strong with demand climbing from the elevated outage environment which continued to drive awareness around the home standby category and the need for homeowners to have backup power sales of our ci mobile and stationary products were also strong during the year with rental telecom and healthcare market verticals experiencing growth

 

the increase in international sales for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to the 307 million contribution from the selmec acquisition and broadbased core growth from the pramac ottomotores and motortech businesses as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe

 

gross profit gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2018 was 358 compared to 348 for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase reflected a favorable mix of home standby generators improved leverage of fixed manufacturing costs on the increase in sales favorable pricing environment and focused initiatives to improve margins these items were partially offset by general inflationary pressures from higher commodities currencies wages and logistics costs

 

operating expenses the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in employee and incentive compensation costs higher sellingrelated variable operating expenses given the higher sales volumes and the recurring operating expenses from the selmec acquisition these items were partially offset by lower promotion marketing and intangible amortization expenses

  

other expense the decrease in other expense net was primarily due to lower interest expense and higher investment income partially offset by the 13 million loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from a 500 million voluntary prepayment of term loan debt

 

provision for income taxes   the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 were 225 and 213 respectively the reduction of the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 as a result of the tax act was more than offset by the 2017 onetime noncash 284 million benefit from revaluing our net deferred tax liabilities in accordance with the tax act

 

net income attributable to generac holdings inc the increase in net income attributable to generac holdings inc was primarily due to the factors outlined above partially offset by an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

 

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margins for the domestic segment for the year ended december 31 2018 were 248 of net sales as compared to 222 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 adjusted ebitda margin in 2018 benefitted from improved operating leverage favorable sales mix from higher shipments of home standby generators a favorable pricing environment lower promotional costs and focused margin improvement initiatives these benefits were partially offset by an increase in employee costs and general inflationary pressures

  

adjusted ebitda margins for the international segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2018 were 79 of net sales as compared to 85 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 the slight decrease in ebitda margin is due to an unfavorable sales mix as 2017 included higher shipments of portable generators following largescale outages from hurricane maria this unfavorable sales mix was partially offset by increased leverage of fixed operating costs in 2018

  

adjusted net income adjusted net income of 2922 million for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 379 from 2119 million for the year ended december 31 2017 due to the factors outlined above partially offset by an increase in cash income tax expense

 

liquidity and financial position 

 

our primary cash requirements include payment for our raw material and component supplies salaries  benefits facility and lease costs operating expenses interest and principal payments on our debt and capital expenditures we finance our operations primarily through cash flow generated from operations and if necessary borrowings under our abl facility

longterm liquidity

offbalance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies 

 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect our supplemental information disclosures including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise we make routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property and equipment prepaid expenses product warranties and other reserves management believes our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment business combinations and purchase accounting and income taxes

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived i ntangible a ssets 

 

refer to note 2 “significant accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for the fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 and found no impairment

 

when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing

 

 

in our october 31 2019 impairment test calculation the latin america reporting unit had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 the carrying value of the latin america goodwill was 481 million key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the reporting unit includes revenue growth levels that reflect recovering end markets an expanding customer and project pipeline increased sales of service parts and service contracts improving profit margins a 3 terminal growth rate and an 111 discount rate the reporting unit’s fair value would approximate its carrying value with a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 100 basis point reduction in the sales continuous annual growth rate and terminal growth rate as of the october 31 2019 impairment test date there was no other reporting unit with a carrying value that was at risk of exceeding its fair value

 

as noted above a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include

 

           

if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors the estimate of the fair values may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition

 

business c ombinations and p urchase a ccounting 

 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions while the ultimate responsibility resides with management for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities including intangible assets and tangible longlived assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions the most significant being projected revenue growth rates profit margins and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate refer to note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s business acquisitions

 

income t axes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known

 

in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the taxable income in prior carryback years scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment

  

refer to note 15 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s income taxes

  

 

new accounting standards 

  

for information with respect to new accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements refer to note 2 “significant accounting policies  new accounting pronouncements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates to reduce the risk from these changes we use financial instruments from time to time we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

 

foreign currency 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as well as operating businesses in foreign countries periodically we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with certain foreign currency purchases and sales in the normal course of business contracts typically have maturities of twelve months or less realized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the statements of comprehensive income

 

the following is a summary of the fortythree foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december 31 2019 notional amount in thousands

 

   

commodity prices 

 

we are a purchaser of commodities and components manufactured from commodities including steel aluminum copper and others as a result we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process depending on the supplier these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags and calculations to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies or supply chain savings to offset increases in commodity costs

 

periodically we engage in certain commodity risk management activities to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results these derivatives typically have maturities of less than eighteen months as of december 31 2019 we had no commodity forward contracts outstanding

  

interest rates 

 

as of december 31 2019 all of the outstanding debt under our term loan and abl facility was subject to floating interest rate risk as of december 31 2019 we had the following interest rate swap contracts outstanding notional amount in thousands of us dollars

 

  

in conjunction with the december amendment to our term loan we also amended the interest swaps to remove the libor floor which resulted in minor reductions to our future dated swap rates at december 31 2019 the fair value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of 106 million even after giving effect to these swaps we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our term loan and abl facility that is not covered by the swaps a hypothetical change in the libor interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed annual cash interest expense by approximately 40 million or without the swaps in place 90 million in 2019

business strategy 

 

we have been executing on our strategic plan which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made to capitalize on the longterm growth prospects of generac as we continue to move our strategic plan into the future we are focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the following four key objectives which are now called “powering our future”

 

growing the residential standby generator market  as the leader in the home standby generator market it is incumbent upon us to continue to drive growth and increase the penetration rate of these products in households across the world central to this strategy is to increase the awareness availability and affordability of home standby generators ongoing power outage activity combined with expanding our residentiallight commercial dealer base and overall distribution in affected regions are key drivers in elevating the awareness of home standby generators over the long term we intend to continue to supplement these key growth drivers by focusing on a variety of strategic initiatives targeted toward generating more sales leads improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of a home standby system in addition we intend to continue to focus on innovation in this growing product category and introduce new products into the marketplace with only approximately 45 penetration of the addressable market of homes in the united states which we define as singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2017 american housing survey for the united states we believe there are opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market both domestically and internationally

 

 

gaining market share  we continue to put a strong focus on improving our share of the power equipment markets in which we participate around the world by emphasizing our innovation and continually expanding our product lines and services we design and build a wide range of products from portable stationary and mobile generators power washers light towers mobile heaters pumps brush mowers and trimmers and other engine powered equipment being number one or number two in all of these categories globally is our goal we have many advantages over our competitors with strengths in our engineering and operations capabilities as well as a global distribution network that we believe can be leveraged further for continued market share gains in the markets we serve around the world

 

lead with gas power generation products  we will attempt to gain incremental market share within commercial and industrial markets through our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fueled standby power solutions while still a smaller portion of the overall ci market we believe demand for these products continues to increase at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators as a result of their lower capital investment and operating costs we also intend to explore new gaseous generator related market opportunities including increasing our product capabilities for continuousduty and prime rated applications by leveraging our deep technical capabilities for gaseousfueled products leading position for natural gas standby generators and growing market acceptance for these products as part of this strategy we plan to continue to expand our natural gas product offering into larger power nodes to take advantage of the continuing shift from diesel to natural gas generators

 

connect with customers partners and product we will work to diversify our business model from solely “equipment centric” to a systems and services provider through connectivity solutions and subscription based applications deployed enterprise wide the first step is increasing connection with our products to unlock opportunities and revenue streams we will develop tools and programs that add value to dealers and endusers that will result in recurring revenue from subscriptions and parts we will leverage data obtained from connected devices by developing predictive analytics that result in continuously improving product quality sales processes and tools energy optimization aftermarket penetration customer experience and alignment with dealers finally we will build or acquire energy management capabilities to monetize an ecosystem of devices that relate to energy use storage generation control and optimization

 

while expansion globally is no longer one of the four key objectives in the powering our future strategic plan it becomes a core piece to the success of each of the objectives the recent acquisitions that now comprise our international segment have significantly increased our global presence by adding product manufacturing and distribution capabilities that serve local markets around the world and have resulted in us becoming a leading global player in the markets for backup power and mobile power equipment as we look forward we intend to leverage our increased international footprint attained from these acquisitions to serve the over 13 billion annual market for power generation equipment outside the us and canada through each of the key objectives discussed above

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report

  

risk factors related to our business and industry 

  

demand for the majority of our products is significantl y affected by unpredictable poweroutage activity that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for the majority of our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts and other power grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location frequency and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the lack of major poweroutage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of poweroutage activity are part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products

  

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses  and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products at the same level if at all if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets

  

 

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials key components and labor we use could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand commodity prices currencies transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components or sufficient labor resources we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation

  

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies which have substantially greater financial resources than we do some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for further information see “item 1—business—competition”

  

our industry is subject to te chnological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

 

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures delayed introductions higher than expected production costs or may not be well accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected

  

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label national  retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large national retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors with whom we do business offer competitors’ products and services impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts for further information see “item 1—business—distribution channels and customers”

  

  

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we consider our intellectual property rights to be important assets and seek to protect them through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to resolve and we might not ultimately prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs we could also be subject to a recall action by regulatory authorities violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims

  

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions noise and product content including standards imposed by the epa carb and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions and carbon monoxide typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines and requirements failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve

  

w e may incur costs and liabilities as a result o f product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability

  

 

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business

  

disruptions caused by labor dis putes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position a work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

  

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including

 

     

in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius of each other we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations

 

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include

 

           

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations

 

 

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

 

we singlesource certain types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit logistical challenges weather events or natural disasters

  

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice s act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows

  

policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

 

changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 

additionally the united kingdom’s status on eu membership and discussions regarding its exit from the eu has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations

  

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired net income could be materially adversely affected 

 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain tradenames at december 31 2018 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 8918 million we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of comprehensive income future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements

  

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes or mix of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products the different accounting systems utilized and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume or mix changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the integration of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations

  

 

in addition the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others

 

                

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction

  

we may encounter difficulties in operating or implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system across our subsidiaries  which may adversely affect our operations and financial reporting 

 

over the past three years we have implemented a new erp system for a majority of our business as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and strengthen our operational and financial processes and our reporting systems we expect to implement the new erp system at our other locations in future years the erp system may not provide the benefits anticipated could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and may impact our ability to process transactions efficiently all of which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations

  

failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business  

  

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products and services for customers and in our it systems further we collect and store sensitive information in our data centers and on our networks government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting confidential information and all types of it systems these actors may engage in fraudulent activities theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage

 

our it systems and our confidential information may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs the risk of such attacks may increase as we integrate newly acquired companies these attacks pose a risk to the security of the products systems and networks of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers as well as to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks through board oversight controls due diligence employee training and communication third party intrusion testing system hardening email and web filters regular patching surveillance and other measures we remain vulnerable to information security threats

 

 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of our systems could result in the disruption of our business or a loss of proprietary or confidential information similarly an attack on our it systems could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns as the threats evolve and become more potent we may incur additional costs to secure the products that we sell as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices

  

risks related to our common stock 

  

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material

  

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws

 

     

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

  

we do not have plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

  

we currently do not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock we intend to use future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business as well as for repayment of outstanding debt acquisitions and for share repurchases in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future while we may change this policy at some point in the future we cannot assure that we will make such a change

  

risks related to our capital structure 

  

we hav e indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 2018 we had total indebtedness of 9240 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate once above a certain libor floor if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do

  

  

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

  

our credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests these restrictions include among other things our ability to

 

          

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants

  

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit ou r ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies in the future if we are unable to refinance our credit facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected

overview 

 

we are a leading global designer and manufacturer of a wide range of power generation equipment and other power products serving the residential light commercial and industrial markets power generation is our primary focus which differentiates us from our main competitors that also have broad operations outside of the power equipment market as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the power equipment market in north america and an expanding presence internationally we believe we have one of the widest ranges of products in the marketplace including residential commercial and industrial standby generators as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications other power products that we design and manufacture include light towers which provide temporary lighting for various end markets commercial and industrial mobile heaters and pumps used in the oil  gas construction and other industrial markets and a broad product line of outdoor power equipment for residential and commercial use

  

business drivers and operational factors 

 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of business drivers and trends as well as operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations

  

  

business drivers and t rends 

 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power generation products mobile product solutions and other power products by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important drivers and trends affecting our industry including the following

 

increasing penetration opportunity many potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for home standby generators are only approximately 45 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2017 american housing survey for the united states the decision to purchase backup power for many lightcommercial buildings such as convenience stores restaurants and gas stations is more returnoninvestment driven and as a result these applications have relatively lower penetration rates as compared to buildings used in codedriven or mission critical applications such as hospitals wastewater treatment facilities 911 call centers data centers and certain industrial locations the emergence of lower cost cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators has helped to increase the penetration of standby generators over the past decade in the lightcommercial market in addition the installed base of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure is still increasing due to the growing importance for uninterrupted voice and data services we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators for residential commercial and industrial purposes

 

effect of large scale and baseline power disruptions power disruptions are an important driver of customer awareness for backup power and have historically influenced demand for generators both in the united states and internationally increased frequency and duration of major power outage events that have a broader impact beyond a localized level increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major power outage event for standby generators for example the major outage events that occurred during the second half of 2017 drove strong demand for portable and home standby generators and the increased awareness of these products contributed to strong revenue growth in both 2017 and 2018 major power disruptions are unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period in addition there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently across the united states that drive the baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the level of baseline power outage activity occurring across the united states can also fluctuate and may cause our financial results to fluctuate from year to year

  

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators is also affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income the value of their home and overall net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators trends in the new housing market highlighted by residential housing starts can also impact demand for our residential generators demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors as well as weather precipitation patterns

 

impact of business capital investment cycle s  the global market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by different capital investment cycles which can vary across the numerous regions around the world in which we participate these markets include nonresidential building construction durable goods and infrastructure spending as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil  gas as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial retail office telecommunications industrial data centers healthcare construction oil  gas and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions as well as credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve in addition we believe demand for our mobile power products will continue to benefit from a secular shift towards renting versus buying this type of equipment we believe the passage of the tax act in 2017 will continue to have a favorable impact on future demand within many of the end markets that we serve as the improved cash flow liquidity and business sentiment may lead to further investments in equipment facilities and infrastructure in the united states

  

f actors affecting results of o perations 

 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing cost control and hedging certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following

 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum along with other components we use in our products as well as changes in labor costs required to produce our products can have a material impact on our results of operations also acquisitions in recent years have further expanded our commercial and operational presence outside of the united states these international acquisitions along with our existing global supply chain expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and regulatory tariffs that can have a material impact on our results of operations

 

 

we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of any inflationary pressures through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us

 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past five years approximately 20 to 24 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 22 to 25 in the second quarter 24 to 28 in the third quarter and 27 to 29 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the occurrence timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period the seasonality experienced during a major power outage and for the subsequent quarters following the event will vary relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred we maintain a flexible production and supply chain infrastructure in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand

 

factors influencing interest expense and cash interest expense  interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements repayments or borrowings of indebtedness and amendments to our credit agreements interest expense decreased during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to lower interest rate spreads resulting from term loan and abl facility amendments new interest rate swaps beginning in 2018 and the repayments of term loan and abl facility borrowings these factors are partially offset by an increase in the market libor rate refer to note 10 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information

 

factors influencing provision for income taxes and cash income taxes paid on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which significantly changes how the us taxes corporations during 2018 the us treasury department treasury issued several new regulations and other guidance which we have incorporated into our final tax calculations at december 31 2018 we consider the tax expense recorded for tax reform to be complete it is possible additional regulations or guidance could be issued by treasury or by a state which may create an additional tax expense or benefit we will update our future tax provisions based on new regulations or guidance accordingly

 

as a result of the tax act we recognized a onetime noncash benefit of 284 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily from the impact of the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities this noncash benefit resulted primarily from the federal rate reduction from 35 to 21

 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 347 million of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining from our acquisition by ccmp capital advisors llc in 2006 that we expect to generate aggregate cash tax savings of approximately 90 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability of our us business and a combined federal and state tax rate of 26 the recognition of the tax benefit associated with these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 32 million through 2020 and 26 million in 2021 based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2021 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes after which our cash tax obligation will increase other domestic acquisitions have resulted in additional tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets that will generate tax savings but are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements

 

acquisitions  over the years we have executed a number of acquisitions that supported our strategic plan a summary of the recent acquisitions can be found in note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 

components of net sales and expenses 

 

net s ales 

 

our net sales primarily consist of product sales to our customers this includes sales of our power generation equipment and other power products to the residential light commercial and industrial markets as well as service parts to our dealer network net sales also include shipping and handling charges billed to customers with the related freight costs included in cost of goods sold additionally we offer other services including extended warranties remote monitoring installation and maintenance services however these services accounted for less than two percent of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2018 refer to note 2 “significant accounting policies  revenue recognition” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our revenue streams and related revenue recognition accounting policies

 

 

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 6 of our sales and our top ten customers representing less than 22 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2018

 

costs of goods s old 

 

the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised approximately 77 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2018 the principal component parts are engines and alternators we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our generators up to 22kw along with certain liquidcooled engines we source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our diesel products for certain natural gas engines we source the base engine block and then add a significant amount of value engineering subsystems and other content to the point that we are recognized as the oem of those engines we design many of the alternators for our units and either manufacture or source alternators for certain of our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable high quality suppliers in some cases these relationships are proprietary

 

the principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process that are sourced are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions we are also impacted by foreign currency fluctuations there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold

 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies support and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales

 

operating e xpenses 

 

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our sales marketing distribution service parts engineering information systems human resources accounting finance risk management legal and tax functions among others these expenses include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs and taxes and are classified into three categories selling and service research and development and general and administrative additionally the amortization expense related to our finitelived intangible assets is included within operating expenses

research and development our research and development expenses support numerous projects covering all of our product lines we operate engineering facilities with extensive capabilities at many locations globally and employ over 400 personnel with focus on new product development existing product improvement and cost containment we are committed to research and development and rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights our research and development costs are expensed as incurred

 

general and administrative our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for general and administrative employees accounting legal and professional services fees information technology costs insurance travel and entertainment expense and other corporate expenses

 

amortization of intangibles our amortization of intangibles expense includes the straightline amortization of finitelived tradenames customer lists patents and other intangibles assets

  

 

other expense income

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated

 

  

the following sets forth our reportable segment information for the periods indicated

 

  

  

 

the following table sets forth our product class information for the periods indicated

 

  

  

net sales    the increase in domestic sales for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to strong broadbased growth in shipments of home standby generators portable generators outdoor power equipment and service parts shipments of residential products were particularly strong with demand climbing from the recent elevated outage environment which continued to drive awareness around the home standby category and the need for homeowners to have backup power sales of our ci mobile and stationary products were also strong during the year with rental telecom and healthcare market verticals experiencing growth

 

the increase in international sales for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to the 307 million contribution from the selmec acquisition and broadbased core growth from the pramac ottomotores and motortech businesses as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe

 

gross profit   gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2018 was 358 compared to 348 for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase reflected a favorable mix of home standby generators better leverage of fixed manufacturing costs on the increase in sales a favorable pricing environment and focused initiatives to improve margins these items were partially offset by general inflationary pressures from higher commodities currencies wages and logistics costs

 

operating expenses   the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in employee and incentive compensation costs higher sellingrelated variable operating expenses given the higher sales volumes and the recurring operating expenses from the selmec acquisition these items were partially offset by lower promotion marketing and intangible amortization expenses

  

other expense the decrease in other expense net was primarily due to lower interest expense and higher investment income partially offset by the 13 million loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from a 500 million voluntary prepayment of term loan debt

 

provision for i ncome tax es    the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 were 225 and 213 respectively the reduction of the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 as a result of the tax act was more than offset by the prior year onetime noncash benefit of 284 million that was recorded primarily to revalue our net deferred tax liabilities in accordance with the tax act

 

net income attributable to generac holdings inc the increase in net income attributable to generac holdings inc was primarily due to the factors outlined above partially offset by an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

 

adjusted ebitda   adjusted ebitda margins for the domestic segment for the year ended december 31 2018 were 246 of net sales as compared to 223 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 adjusted ebitda margin in the current year benefitted from improved operating leverage favorable sales mix from higher shipments of home standby generators a favorable pricing environment lower promotional costs and focused margin improvement initiatives these benefits were partially offset by an increase in employee costs and general inflationary pressures

  

adjusted ebitda margins for the international segment before deducting for noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2018 were 81 of net sales as compared to 72 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 the improvement was primarily due to increased leverage of fixed operating costs on the higher organic sales and favorable mix

  

adjusted net income   adjusted net income of 2922 million for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 379 from 2119 million for the year ended december 31 2017 due to the factors outlined above partially offset by an increase in cash income tax expense

the following table sets forth our product class information for the periods indicated

 

  

net sales  the increase in domestic sales for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to strong growth in shipments of home standby and portable generators driven by increased power outage activity along with strong growth for mobile products due to recovery in the general rental and oil  gas markets given the continued replacement cycle by our rental customers

 

the increase in international sales for the year ended december 31 2017 was due to the contribution from the recent acquisitions of pramac and motortech the growth was also due to increased organic shipments of both ci and residential products within the european and latin america regions

 

the total contribution from nonannualized recent acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2017 was 697 million

 

 

gross profit   gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2017 was 348 compared to 354 for the year ended december 31 2016 which included 27 million of business optimization and restructuring costs classified within cost of goods sold to address the significant and extended downturn for capital spending within the oil  gas industry as well as 42 million of expense relating to the purchase accounting adjustment for the stepup in value of inventories relating to the pramac acquisition the year ended december 31 2017 included 20 million of business optimization and nonrecurring plant consolidation costs excluding the impact of these charges proforma gross margins were 349 and 359 in 2017 and 2016 respectively the proforma decrease in gross margins was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix attributable to higher organic sales within the international segment and of mobile products relative to 2016 which carry lower gross margins relative to the consolidated average additionally the mix impact from the pramac and motortech acquisitions and higher commodity prices negatively impacted gross margin these impacts were partially offset by improved leverage of fixed manufacturing costs on the higher organic sales volumes and net favorable pricing impacts

 

operating expenses   the 2016 operating expenses included 44 million of business optimization and restructuring costs classified within operating expenses to address the downturn for capital spending within the oil  gas industry excluding the impact of these charges operating expenses increased 289 million or 95 as compared to 2016 the increase was primarily due to the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the pramac and motortech acquisitions and an increase in personnel costs including higher incentive compensation accrued during 2017 partially offset by a decline in amortization of intangibles

  

other expense the decrease in other expense was primarily due to a 2016 30 million noncash loss on change in contractual interest rate not repeating in 2017 and a 2016 06 million loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from a 250 million voluntary prepayment of term loan debt additionally interest expense decreased in 2017 due to the 250 million term loan prepayment in november 2016 term loan repricings in may and december 2017 and decreased borrowings at other subsidiaries these impacts were partially offset by an increase in libor rates and foreign currency transactional losses

 

provision for income taxes the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 were 217 and 368 respectively the decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the provisional favorable effect of the tax act including a onetime noncash benefit of 284 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation

 

net income attributable to generac holdings inc the increase in net income attributable to generac holdings inc was primarily due to the factors outlined above partially offset by an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

 

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margins for the domestic segment for the year ended december 31 2017 were 223 of net sales as compared to 221 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was primarily due to improved overall leverage of fixed operating expenses on the organic increase in sales and the net favorable impact of pricing these impacts were partially offset by higher commodity prices and an increase in personnel costs including higher incentive compensation accrued during 2017

  

adjusted ebitda margins for the international segment for the year ended december 31 2017 were 72 of net sales as compared to 63 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to improved overall leverage of fixed manufacturing and operating expenses on the organic increase in sales the addition of the motortech acquisition and cost reduction actions these impacts were partially offset by higher commodity prices and increased operating expenses associated with the expansion of certain branch operations

  

adjusted net income adjusted net income of 2119 million for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 83 from 1956 million for the year ended december 31 2016 due to the factors outlined above partially offset by an increase in cash income tax expense

the following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented

 

  

the 67 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an overall increase in operating earnings partially offset by a lesser benefit from working capital reductions during 2017 which was primarily due to replenishing inventory levels in the first quarter of 2017 following hurricane matthew and ramping up production in the second half of 2017 in response to hurricanes harvey irma and maria

critical accounting policies 

 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect our supplemental information disclosures including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise we make routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property and equipment prepaid expenses product warranties and other reserves management believes our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment business combinations and purchase accounting defined benefit pension obligations and income taxes

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived i ntangible a ssets 

 

refer to note 2 “significant accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets

 

the company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for the fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 and found no impairment there were no reporting units with a carrying value atrisk of exceeding fair value as of the october 31 2018 impairment test date

 

 

when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing

 

as noted above a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include

 

           

if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors the estimate of the fair values may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition

 

business c ombinations and p urchase a ccounting 

 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions while the ultimate responsibility resides with management for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities including intangible assets and tangible longlived assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions the most significant being projected revenue growth rates earnings margins and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate refer to note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s business acquisitions

  

defined benefit p ension o bligations 

 

the company’s pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets such rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering factors including market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2018 used a discount rate of 424 our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of “aa” or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant

 

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service no compensation increase is assumed in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation as the plans were frozen effective december 31 2008 further information regarding the funded status of our pension plans can be found in note 14 “benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 

 

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations there is no minimum required contribution due to our pension plan in 2019

 

income t axes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known

 

in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the taxable income in prior carryback years scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment

  

refer to note 13 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s income taxes

business strategy 

we have been executing on our “powering ahead” strategic plan which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made to capitalize on the longterm growth prospects of generac as we continue to move the powering ahead plan into the future we are focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the same four key objectives   

 

growing the residential standby generator market as the leader in the home standby generator market it is incumbent upon us to continue to drive growth and increase the penetration rate of these products in households across the united states and canada central to this strategy is to increase the awareness availability and affordability of home standby generators ongoing power outage activity combined with expanding our residentiallight commercial dealer base and overall distribution in affected regions are key drivers in elevating the awareness of home standby generators over the long term we intend to continue to supplement these key growth drivers by focusing on a variety of strategic initiatives targeted toward generating more sales leads improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of a home standby system in addition we intend to continue to focus on innovation in this growing product category and introduce new products into the marketplace with only approximately 40 penetration of the addressable market of homes in the united states which we define as singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2015 american housing survey for the united states we believe there are opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market 

 

 

gaining commercial and industrial market share our growth strategy for commercial and industrial power generation products is focused on incremental market share gains key to this objective are efforts to leverage our expanding platform of diesel and natural gas offerings by better optimizing our industrial distribution partners’ capabilities to market  sell and support these products specifically we continue to pursue certain initiatives to expand our distributors’ interactions with engineering firms and electrical contractors responsible for specifying and selecting our products within ci power generation applications we are also committed to a number of sales process initiatives and gotomarket strategies to increase market visibility and improve the overall specification rates for our products which should increase quoting activity and close rates for our industrial distributors 

 

lead with gas power generation products  we will attempt to gain incremental market share within commercial and industrial markets through our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fueled standby power solutions while still a smaller portion of the overall ci market we believe demand for these products continues to increase at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators as a result of their lower capital investment and operating costs we also intend to explore new gaseous generator related market opportunities including increasing our product capabilities for continuousduty and prime rated applications by leveraging our deep technical capabilities for gaseousfueled products leading position for natural gas standby generators and growing market acceptance for these products as part of this strategy we plan to continue to expand our natural gas product offering into larger power nodes to take advantage of the continuing shift from diesel to natural gas generators 

 

expanding global presence  we have increased our revenues shipped outside the us and canada in recent years with sales outside this region accounting for approximately 22 of our revenues during 2017 as compared to approximately 2 0 and 10 in 2016 and 2015 respectively this increase is largely the result of acquisitions made that comprise our international segment – ottomotores tower light pramac and motortech  these businesses have significantly increased our global presence by adding product manufacturing and distribution capabilities that serve local markets around the world and have resulted in us becoming a leading global player in the markets for backup power and mobile power equipment as we look forward we intend to leverage our increased international footprint attained from these acquisitions to serve the over 13 billion annual market for power generation equipment outside the us and canada we also intend to improve the profit margins of our international segment by executing on several revenue and cost synergies and driving organic growth in existing markets with additional investment and focus including the expanding opportunity for global gaseousfueled products we will continue to evaluate other opportunities to expand into additional regions of the world through both organic initiatives and potential acquisitions  

 

we believe t he investments we have made to date due in part to our powering ahead strategy have helped to capitalize on the macro secular growth drivers for our business and are an important part of our efforts to diversify and globalize our business see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – business drivers and trends” for additional drivers that influence demand for our products and other trends affecting the markets that we serve

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operation s or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report 

  

risk factors r elated to our business and industry 

  

demand for the majority of our products is significantl y affected by unpredictable poweroutage activity that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for the majority of our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts and other power grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location frequency and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the lack of major poweroutage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of poweroutage activity are part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products 

  

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses  and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products at the same level if at all if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets 

  

 

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 

  

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies which have substantially greater financial resources than we do some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for further information see “item 1—business—competition” 

  

our industry is subject to te chnological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

 

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures delayed introductions higher than expected production costs or may not be well accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label national  retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and c onstruction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large national retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors with whom we do business offer competitors’ products and services impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts for further information see “item 1—business—distribution channels and customers” 

 

 

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we consider our intellectual property rights to be important assets and seek to protect them through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to resolve and we might not ultimately prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention  andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements 

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs we could also be subject to a recall action by regulatory authorities violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

  

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa carb and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions and carbon monoxide typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines and requirements failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 

  

w e may incur costs and liabilities as a result o f product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability 

  

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business

  

  

disruptions caused by labor dis putes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position a work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

     

in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius of each other we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 

 

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include

 

           

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations

 

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

 

we singlesource certain types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit weather events or natural disasters 

  

 

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice s act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

  

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired net income could be materially adversely affected 

 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain t radenames at december 31 2017 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 8498 million we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of comprehensive income future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

  

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes or mix of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products the different accounting systems utilized and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume or mix changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the integration of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

in addition the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others

 

                

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of t he full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

  

we may encounter difficulties in operating or implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system across our subsidiaries  which may adversely affect our operations and financial reporting 

 

over the past two years we have implemented a new erp system for a majority of our business as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and strengthen our operational and financial processes and our reporting systems we expect to implement the new erp system at our other locations in future years the erp system may not provide the benefits anticipated could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and may impact our ability to process transactions efficiently all of which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

  

failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business  

  

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products and services for customers and in our it systems further we collect and store sensitive information in our data centers and on our networks government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting confidential information and all types of it systems these actors may engage in fraudulent activities theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage 

 

our it systems and our confidential information may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs these attacks pose a risk to the security of the products systems and networks of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers as well as to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks through controls due diligence training surveillance and other measures we remain vulnerable to information security threats 

 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of our systems could result in the disruption of our business or a loss of proprietary or confidential information similarly an attack on our it systems could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns as the threats evolve and become more potent we may incur additional costs to secure the products that we sell as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices 

 

recently enacted us tax legislation as well as future us tax legislation may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

 

on december 22 2017 the president signed into law public law no 11597 a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that makes significant changes to us federal income tax laws we have performed a preliminary assessment of the impact of the tax act however as the tax act is complex and farreaching there could be future effects of the tax act that we have not identified and that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

  

  

risks related to our common stock 

  

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material

  

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws

 

     

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

  

we do not have plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

  

we currently do not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock we intend to use future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business as well as for repayment of outstanding debt acquisitions and for share repurchases in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future while we may change this policy at some point in the future we cannot assure that we will make such a change 

  

risks related to our capital structure 

  

we hav e indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 201 7 we had total indebtedness of 9287 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our indebtedness combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences for example it could 

 

      

 

any of the abovelisted factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate once above a certain libor floor if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do

  

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

  

our credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests these restrictions include among other things our ability to

 

          

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants 

  

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit ou r ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies in the future if we are unable to refinance our credit facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected

overview 

 

we are a leading global designer and manufacturer of a wide range of power generation equipment and other engine powered products serving the residential light commercial and industrial markets power generation is our primary focus which differentiates us from our main competitors that also have broad operations outside of the power equipment market as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the power equipment market in north america and an expanding presence internationally we believe we have one of the widest ranges of products in the marketplace including residential commercial and industrial standby generators as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications other engine powered products that we design and manufacture include light towers which provide temporary lighting for various end markets commercial and industrial mobile heaters and pumps used in the oil  gas construction and other industrial markets and a broad product line of outdoor power equipment for residential and commercial use 

 

recent developments 

 

on february 13 2018 we signed a purchase agreement to acquire selmec equipos industriales sa de cv selmec which is headquartered in mexico city mexico selmec which has approximately 300 employees is a designer and manufacturer of industrial generators ranging from 10 kw to 2750 kw selmec offers a marketleading service platform and specialized engineering capabilities together with robust integration project management and remote monitoring services 

  

 

business d rivers and operational factors 

 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of business drivers and trends as well as operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 

 

business drivers and t rends 

 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power generation products mobile product solutions and other engine powered products by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important drivers and trends affecting our industry including the following 

 

increasing penetration opportunity many potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for home standby generators are only approximately 40 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2015 american housing survey for the united states the decision to purchase backup power for many lightcommercial buildings such as convenience stores restaurants and gas stations is more returnoninvestment driven and as a result these applications have relatively lower penetration rates as compared to buildings used in codedriven or mission critical applications such as hospitals wastewater treatment facilities 911 call centers data centers and certain industrial locations the emergence of lower cost cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators has helped to increase the penetration of standby generators over the past decade in the lightcommercial market in addition the installed base of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure is still increasing due to the growing importance for uninterrupted voice and data services we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators for residential commercial and industrial purposes 

 

effect of large scale and baseline power disruptions   power disruptions are an important driver of customer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators both in the united states and internationally increased frequency and duration of major power outage events that have a broader impact beyond a localized level increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major power outage event for standby generators for example the major outage events that occurred during the second half of 2017 drove strong demand for portable and home standby generators and the increased awareness of these products contributed to strong revenue growth in 2017 major power disruptions are unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period in addition there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently across the united states that drive the baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the level of baseline power outage activity occurring across the united states can also fluctuate and may cause our financial results to fluctuate from year to year 

  

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators is also affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income the value of their home and overall net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators trends in the new housing market highlighted by residential housing starts can also impact demand for our residential generators demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors as well as weather precipitation patterns 

 

impact of business capital investment cycle s  the global market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by different capital investment cycles which can vary across the numerous regions around the world in which we participate these markets include nonresidential building construction durable goods and infrastructure spending as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil  gas as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial retail telecommunications industrial data centers healthcare construction oil  gas and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions as well as credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve in addition we believe demand for our mobile power products will continue to benefit from a secular shift towards renting versus buying this type of equipment we believe the passage of the tax act in late 2017 could have a favorable impact on future demand within many of the end markets that we serve as the improved cash flow liquidity and business sentiment may lead to further investments in equipment facilities and infrastructure in the united states 

  

 

f actors affecting results of o perations 

 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development ex panded distribution pricing cost control and hedging certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following 

 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum along with other components we use in our products can have a material impact on our results of operations also acquisitions in recent years have further expanded our commercial and operational presence outside of the united states these acquisitions along with our existing international presence exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that can have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of rising commodity currency and component prices through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 

 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past five years approximately 20 to 27 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 22 to 25 in the second quarter 24 to 27 in the third quarter and 25 to 29 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the occurrence timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period the seasonality experienced during a major power outage and for the subsequent quarters following the event will vary relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred we maintain a flexible production and supply chain infrastructure in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand 

 

factors influencing interest expense and cash interest expense  interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements and repayments or borrowings of indebtedness cash interest expense decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the 25 million voluntary prepayment of term loan debt in november 2016 the may and december 2017 term loan refinancings the repayment of 100 million of abl facility borrowings and decreased borrowings at other subsidiaries partially offset by an increase in the libor rate refer to note 10 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

 

factors influencing provision for income taxes and cash income taxes paid on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which significantly changes how the us taxes corporations the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act and significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation 

 

as a result of the tax act we recognized a onetime noncash benefit of 284 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily from the impact of the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities while the company continues to assess the full impact of the tax act the preliminary analysis suggests a meaningful benefit from the legislation specifically for 2018 the combined federal and state effective tax rate is expected to decline to between 25 to 26 resulting in lower cash income taxes as we complete our analysis of the tax act collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made refer to note 13 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the tax act and its impact 

 

further w e had approximately 470 million of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december 31 2017 related to our acquisition by ccmp capital advisors llc in 2006 that we expect to generate aggregate cash tax savings of approximately 122 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability and a 26 combined federal and state tax rate the aggregate cash tax savings reflects a decrease of 61 million due to a reduction in the assumed tax rate from 39 to 26 as a result of the tax act the recognition of the tax benefit associated with these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 32 million through 2020 and 26 million in 2021 assuming profitability and a 26 combined federal and state tax rate as a result of the asset acquisition of the magnum business in the fourth quarter of 2011 we had approximately 34 million of incremental tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets remaining as of december 31 2017 we expect these assets to generate aggregate cash tax savings of 90 million through 2026 assuming continued profitability and a 26 combined federal and state tax rate the aggregate cash tax savings reflects a decrease of 45 million due to a reduction in the assumed tax rate from 39 to 26 as a result of the tax act the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 38 million annually through 2025 and 28 million in 2026 which generates an additional annual cash tax savings of 10 million through 2025 and 07 million in 2026 assuming profitability and a 26 combined federal and state tax rate based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2026 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes other domestic acquisitions have resulted in additional tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets that will generate tax savings but are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

acquisitions over the years we have executed a number of acquisitions that supported our strategic plan a summary of the recent acquisitions can be found in note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

components of net sales and e xpenses 

 

net s ales 

 

substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our power generation equipment and other engine powered products to the residential light commercial and industrial markets we also sell service parts to our dealer network net sales which include shipping and handling charges billed to customers are generally recognized upon shipment of products to our customers related freight costs are included in cost of sales 

 

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 6 of our sales and our top ten customers representing less than 22 of our total sales for the year ended december 31 2017 

 

costs of goods s old 

 

the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised approximately 77 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2017 the principal component parts are engines and alternators we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our generators up to 22kw along with certain liquidcooled engines we source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our diesel products for certain natural gas engines we source the base engine block and then add a significant amount of value engineering subsystems and other content to the point that we are recognized as the oem of those engines we design many of the alternators for our units and either manufacture or source alternators for certain of our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable high quality suppliers in some cases these relationships are proprietary 

 

the principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process that are sourced are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 

 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies support and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales 

 

operating e xpenses 

 

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our sales marketing distribution service parts engineering information systems human resources finance risk management legal and tax functions among others these expenses include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs and taxes and are classified into three categories selling and service research and development and general and administrative additionally the amortization expense related to our finitelived intangible assets is included within operating expenses 

 

selling and service our selling and service expenses consist primarily of personnel expense marketing expense warranty expense and other sales expenses our personnel expense recorded in selling and services expenses includes the expense of our sales force responsible for our broad customer base and other personnel involved in the marketing sales and service of our products warranty expense which is recorded at the time of sale is estimated based on historical trends our marketing expenses include direct mail costs printed material costs product display costs market research expenses trade show expenses media advertising promotional expenses and coop advertising costs marketing expenses are generally related to the launch of new product offerings participation in trade shows and other events and opportunities to create market awareness for home standby generators in areas impacted by heightened power outage activity 

 

research and development our research and development expenses support numerous projects covering all of our product lines we operate engineering facilities at many locations globally and employ over 350 personnel with focus on new product development existing product improvement and cost containment we are committed to research and development and rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 

 

general and administrative our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for general and administrative employees accounting legal and professional services fees information technology costs insurance travel and entertainment expense and other corporate expenses 

 

 

amortization of intangibles our amortization of intangibles expense includes the straightline amortization of finitelived tradenames customer lists patents and other intangibles assets 

 

other expense income 

 

other expense income includes the interest expense on our outstanding borrowings amortization of debt financing costs and original issue discount and expenses related to interest rate swap agreements other expense income also includes other financial items such as losses on extinguishment of debt gains losses on change in contractual interest rate interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and costs related to acquisitions

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated

 

  

the following sets forth our reportable segment information for the periods indicated

 

  

  

 

the following table sets forth our product class information for the periods indicated

 

  

net sales    the increase in domestic sales for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to strong growth in shipments of home standby and portable generators driven by increased power outage activity along with strong growth for mobile products due to recovery in the general rental and oil  gas markets given the continued replacement cycle by our rental customers

the 30 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an overall increase in operating earnings partially offset by a lesser benefit from working capital reductions during the current year which was primarily due to replenishing inventory levels in the first quarter of 2017 following hurricane matthew and ramping up production in the second half of 2017 in response to hurricanes harvey irma and maria

capital e xpenditures 

 

our operations require capital expenditures for technology tooling equipment capacity expansion  systems and upgrades capital expenditures were 333 million 305 million and 307 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively and were funded through cash from operations

critical accounting p olicies 

 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company including information about contingencies risk and financial condition the company believes given current facts and circumstances that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property and equipment prepaid expenses product warranties and other reserves management believes the company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment business combinations and purchase accounting defined benefit pension obligations and income taxes 

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived i ntangible a ssets 

 

refer to note 2 “significant accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

the company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for the fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 and found no impairment following the 2017 and 2016 tests there were no reporting units with a carrying value atrisk of exceeding fair value as of the october 31 2017 impairment test date 

 

 

after performing the impairment tests for fiscal year 2015 the company determined that the fair value of the ottomotores reporting unit was less than its carrying value resulting in a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 46 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 the fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis which utilizes key estimates and assumptions as discussed below additionally in the fourth quarter of 2015 the company’s board of directors approved a plan to strategically transition and consolidate certain of the company’s brands acquired through acquisitions to the generac® tradename this brand strategy change resulted in a reclassification to a two year remaining useful life for the impacted tradenames causing the fair value to be less than the carrying value using the relieffromroyalty approach in a discounted cash flow analysis as such a 361 million noncash impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 to writedown the impacted tradenames to net realizable value see note 2 “significant accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the impairment charges recorded in 2015 

 

when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing 

 

as noted above a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 

           

if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors the estimate of the fair values may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

 

business c ombinations and p urchase a ccounting 

 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions while the ultimate responsibility resides with management for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities including intangible assets and tangible longlived assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions the most significant being projected revenue growth rates earnings margins and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate refer to note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s business acquisitions 

  

 

defined benefit p ension o bligations 

 

t he company’s pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets such rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering factors including market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2017 used a discount rate of 360 for the salaried pension plan and 362 for the hourly pension plan our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of “aa” or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 

 

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service  no compensation increase is assumed in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation as the plans were frozen effective december 31 2008 further information regarding the funded status of our pension plans can be found in note 14 “benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations given this policy we expect to make 03 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2018 at a minimum 

 

income t axes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740  income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 

 

in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the taxable income in prior carryback years scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment

business strategy 

 

we have been executing on our “ powering ahead” strategic plan which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made to capitalize on the longterm growth prospects of generac as we continue to move the powering ahead plan into the future we are focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the same four key objectives 

 

growing the residential standby generator market as the leader in the home standby generator market it is incumbent upon us to continue to drive growth and increase the penetration rate of these products in households across the united states and canada central to this strategy is to increase the awareness availability and affordability of home standby generators ongoing power outage activity combined with expanding our residentiallight commercial dealer base and overall distribution in affected regions are key drivers in elevating the awareness of home standby generators over the long term we intend to continue to supplement these key growth drivers by focusing on a variety of strategic initiatives targeted toward generating more sales leads improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of a home standby system in addition we intend to continue to focus on innovation in this growing product category and introduce new products into the marketplace with only approximately 40 penetration of the addressable market of homes in the united states which we define as singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2015 american housing survey for the united states we believe there are opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market 

 

gaining commercial and industrial market share our growth strategy for commercial and industrial power generation products is focused on incremental market share gains key to this objective are efforts to leverage our expanding platform of diesel and natural gas offerings by better optimizing our industrial distribution partners’ capabilities to market  sell and support these products specifically we continue to pursue certain initiatives to expand our distributors’ interactions with engineering firms and electrical contractors responsible for specifying and selecting our products within ci power generation applications we are also committed to a number of sales process initiatives to improve the overall specification rates for our products which should increase quoting activity and close rates for our industrial distributors 

 

lead with gas power generation products  we will attempt to gain incremental market share within commercial and industrial markets through our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fueled standby power solutions while still a much smaller portion of the overall ci market we believe demand for these products continues to increase at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators as a result of their lower capital investment and operating costs we also intend to explore new gaseous generator related market opportunities including increasing our product capabilities for continuousduty and prime rated applications by leveraging our deep technical capabilities for gaseousfueled products leading position for natural gas standby generators and growing market acceptance for these products 

 

expanding global presence we have increased our revenues shipped outside the us and canada in recent years with sales outside this region accounting for approximately 2 0 of our revenues during 2016 as compared to approximately 10 and 9 in 2015 and 2014 respectively this increase is largely the result of acquisitions made that comprise our international segment – ottomotores tower light and pramac these businesses have significantly increased our global presence by adding product manufacturing and distribution capabilities that serve local markets around the world and have resulted in us becoming a leading global player in the markets for backup power and mobile power equipment as we look forward we intend to leverage our increased international footprint attained from these acquisitions to serve the over 13 billion annual market for power generation equipment outside the us and canada we also intend to improve the profit margins of our international segment by executing on several revenue and cost synergies and driving organic growth in existing markets with additional investment and focus including the expanding opportunity for global gaseousfueled products we will continue to evaluate other opportunities to expand into additional regions of the world through both organic initiatives and potential acquisitions  

 

 

 

we believe t he investments we have made to date due in part to our powering ahead strategy have helped to capitalize on the macro secular growth drivers for our business and are an important part of our efforts to diversify and globalize our business see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – business drivers and trends” for additional drivers that influence demand for our products and other trends affecting the markets that we serve 

 

manufacturing 

 

we operate numerous manufacturing plants distribution facilities and inventory warehouses located throughout the world we maintain inventory warehouses in the united states that accommodate material storage and rapid response requirements of our customers see “item 2 – properties” for additional details regarding the locations and activities of our principal operations 

 

in recent years we have added manufacturing capacity through investments in automation improved utilization and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint through organic means as well as through acquisitions we believe we have sufficient capacity to achieve our business goals for the neartointermediate term 

  

research and d evelopment 

 

our primary focus on power generation equipment and other engine powered products drives technological innovation specialized engineering and manufacturing competencies research and development rd is a core competency and includes a staf f of over 300 engineers working on numerous projects our sponsored research and development expense was 372 million 329 million and 315 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively research and development is conducted at several of our manufacturing facilities worldwide and is focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements as well as maintaining product competitiveness by improving manufacturing costs safety characteristics reliability and performance while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards we have over 30 years of experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology in the residential and light commercial markets we have developed proprietary engines cooling packages controls fuel systems and emissions systems we believe that our expertise in engine powered equipment gives us the capability to develop new products that will allow continued diversification in our end markets

we are committed to research and development and w e rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights our patents protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems air flow electronics and controls noise reduction and aircooled engines we believe the existence of these patents and trademarks along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position we also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment 

 

suppliers of raw m aterials 

 

our primary raw material inputs are steel copper and aluminum all of which are purchased from third parties and in many cases as part of machined or manufactured components we have developed an extensive network of reliable suppliers in the united states and internationally our strategic global sourcing function continuously evaluates the quality and cost structure of our products and assesses the capabilities of our supply chain components are sourced accordingly based on this evaluation our supplier quality engineers conduct onsite audits of major supply chain partners and help to maintain the reliability of critical sourced components 

  

competition 

 

the market for power generation equipment and other engine powered products is competitive we face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers along with mobile equipment and engine powered tools providers both domestic and internationally however specifically in the generator market most of the traditional participants compete on a more specialized basis focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix we are the only significant market participant with a primary focus on power generation with a core emphasis on standby portable and mobile generators with broad capabilities across the residential lightcommercial and industrial markets we believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enables us to maintain a firstmover advantage over our competition for product innovation we also believe our broad product offering diverse distribution model and strong factory support provide additional advantages as well 

 

 

 

a summary of the primary competitors across our main product classes are as follows

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operation s or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report 

  

risk factors r elated to our business and industry 

  

demand for the majority of our products is significantl y affected by unpredictable poweroutage activity that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for the majority of our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts and other power grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location frequency and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the lack of major poweroutage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of poweroutage activity are part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products 

  

 

 

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses  and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products at the same level if at all if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets 

  

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 

  

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies which have substantially greater financial resources than we do some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for further information see “item 1—business—competition” 

  

our industry is subject to te chnological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

 

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures delayed introductions higher than expected production costs or may not be well accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

 

 

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label telecommunications retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and c onstruction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large telecommunications retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors with whom we do business offer competitors’ products and services impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts for further information see “item 1—business—distribution channels and customers” 

 

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we consider our intellectual property rights to be important assets and seek to protect them through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to resolve and we might not ultimately prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention  andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements 

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs we could also be subject to a recall action by regulatory authorities violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

  

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa carb and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines and requirements failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 

 

 

 

w e may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability 

  

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business

  

disruptions caused by labor dis putes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position a work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

     

in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius of each other we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 

 

 

 

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include

 

           

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations

 

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

 

we singlesource certain types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit weather events or natural disasters 

  

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice s act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

  

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired net income could be materially adversely affected 

 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain t radenames at december 31 2016 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 8330 million we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of operations future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

  

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the combination of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

 

 

in addition the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others

 

                

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction

  

we may encounter difficulties in implementing or operating a new enterprise resource planning erp system across our subsidiaries which may adversely affect our operations and financial reportin g 

 

in 2016 w e implemented a new erp system for a majority of our business as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and strengthen our operational and financial processes and our reporting systems and we will be implementing the new erp system at our other locations in future years the erp system may not provide the benefits anticipated could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and may impact our ability to process transactions efficiently all of which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

  

failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products and services for customers and in our it systems further we collect and store sensitive information in our data centers and on our networks government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting confidential information and all types of it systems these actors may engage in fraudulent activities theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage 

 

our it systems and our confidential information may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs these attacks pose a risk to the security of the products systems and networks of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers as well to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks through controls due diligence training surveillance and other measures we remain vulnerable to information security threats 

 

 

 

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of our systems could result in the disruption of our business loss of proprietary or confidential information or injuries to people or property similarly an attack on our it systems could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns as the threats evolve and become more potent we may incur additional costs to secure the products that we sell as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices 

  

risks related to our common stock 

  

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material

  

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws

 

     

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

  

we do not have plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

  

we currently do not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock we intend to use future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business as well as for repayment of outstanding debt and for share repurchases in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future while we may change this policy at some point in the future we cannot assure that we will make such a change 

  

risks related to our capital structure 

  

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 

  

we have a sign ificant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2016 we had total indebtedness of 10529 million our significant level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our significant indebtedness combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences for example it could 

 

       

 

 

any of the abovelisted factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate once above a certain libor floor if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do

  

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

  

our credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests these restrictions include among other things our ability to

 

          

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants 

  

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit ou r ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies in the future if we are unable to refinance our credit facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected

overview 

 

we are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of power generation equipment and other engine powered products serving the residential light commercial and industrial markets power generation is our primary focus which differentiates us from our primary competitors that also have broad operations outside of the power equipment market as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the power equipment market in north america and an expanding presence internationally we believe we have one of the widest ranges of products in the marketplace including residential commercial and industrial standby generators as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications other engine powered products that we design and manufacture include light towers which provide temporary lighting for various end markets commercial and industrial mobile heaters used in the oil  gas construction and other industrial markets and a broad product line of outdoor power equipment for residential and commercial use 

 

over the past several years we have executed a number of acquisitions that support our strategic plan a summary of these acquisitions can be found in note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

business d rivers and operational factors 

 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of business drivers and trends as well as operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 

  

business drivers and t rends 

 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power generation products mobile product solutions and other engine powered products by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important drivers and trends affecting our industry including the following 

 

increasing penetration opportunity many potential customers are not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for home standby generators are only approximately 40 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2015 american housing survey for the united states the decision to purchase backup power for many lightcommercial buildings such as convenience stores restaurants and gas stations is more returnoninvestment driven and as a result these applications have relatively lower penetration rates as compared to buildings used in codedriven or mission critical applications such as hospitals wastewater treatment facilities 911 call centers data centers and certain industrial locations the emergence of lower cost cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators has helped to increase the penetration of standby generators in the lightcommercial market in addition the installed base of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure is increasing due to the growing importance for uninterrupted voice and data services we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby and mobile generators for residential commercial and industrial purposes 

 

 

 

effect of large scale and baseline power disruptions   power disruptions are an important driver of customer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators both in the united states and internationally increased frequency and duration of major power outage events that have a broader impact beyond a localized level increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a portable or standby generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for nine to twelve months following a major power outage event for standby generators major power disruptions are unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period in addition there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently across the united states that drive the baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the level of baseline power outage activity occurring across the united states can also fluctuate and may cause our financial results to fluctuate from year to year 

  

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators is also affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income the value of their home and overall net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators trends in the new housing market highlighted by residential housing starts can also impact demand for our residential generators demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors as well as weather precipitation patterns 

 

impact of business capital investment cycle s  the global market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by different capital investment cycles which can vary across the numerous regions around the world in which we participate these markets include nonresidential building construction durable goods and infrastructure spending as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil  gas as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial retail telecommunications industrial data centers healthcare construction oil  gas and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions as well as credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve in addition we believe demand for our mobile power products benefit over the long term from a secular shift towards renting versus buying this type of equipment 

  

f actors affecting results of o perations 

 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing and cost control certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following 

 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum along with other components we use in our products can have a material impact on our results of operations also with the pramac acquisition in 2016 we have further expanded our commercial and operational presence outside of the united states this acquisition along with our existing international presence exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that can have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of rising commodity currency and component prices through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 

 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past five years approximately 23 to 27 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 20 to 25 in the second quarter 24 to 27 in the third quarter and 25 to 29 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the occurrence timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period the seasonality experienced during a major power outage and for the subsequent quarters following the event will vary relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred we maintain a flexible production and supply chain infrastructure in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand 

 

factors influencing interest expense and cash interest expense  interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements credit facility pricing grids and repayments or borrowings of indebtedness cash interest expense increased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due additional debt assumed in recent acquisitions increased borrowings at other foreign subsidiaries and an increase in the libor rate refer to note 10 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

 

 

 

factors influencing provision for income taxes and cash income taxes paid we had approximately 592 million of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december 31 2016 related to our acquisition by ccmp in 2006 that we expect to generate aggregate cash tax savings of approximately 231 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the recognition of the tax benefit associated with these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 48 million through 2020 and 40 million in 2021 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate as a result of the asset acquisition of the magnum business in the fourth quarter of 2011 we had approximately 380 million of incremental tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets remaining as of december 31 2016 we expect these assets to generate aggregate cash tax savings of 149 million through 2026 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 38 million annually through 2025 and 28 million in 2026 which generates an additional annual cash tax savings of 15 million through 2025 and 11 million in 2026 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2026 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes other domestic acquisitions have resulted in additional tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets that will generate tax savings but are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

components of net sales and e xpenses 

 

net s ales 

 

substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our power generator equipment and other engine powered products to the residential light commercial and industrial markets we also sell engines to certain customers and service parts to our dealer network net sales which include shipping and handling charges billed to customers are generally recognized upon shipment of products to our customers related freight costs are included in cost of sales 

 

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 7 of our sales and our top ten customers representing less than 22 of our total sales for the year ended december 31 2016 

 

costs of goods s old

the principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process that are sourced are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions however there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 

 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies support and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales

net sales    the decrease in domestic sales for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily due to significant declines in shipments of mobile products into oil  gas and general rental markets partially offsetting these impacts was the contribution from the chp acquisition along with increased shipments of portable and home standby generators 

 

the increase in international sales for the y ear ended december 31 2016 was due to the contribution from the pramac acquisition partially offsetting this impact were declines in organic shipments of mobile products into the european region 

 

the total contribution from nonannualized recent acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2016 was 2366 million 

 

net income attributable to generac holdings inc  net income attributable to generac holdings inc for the year ended december 31 2016 includes the impact of 71 million of nonrecurring pretax charges relating to business optimization and restructuring costs to address the impact of the significant and extended downturn for capital spending within the oil  gas industry the costreduction actions taken include the consolidation of production facilities headcount reductions certain noncash asset writedowns and other nonrecurring productrelated charges the charges consist of 27 million classified within cost of goods sold and 44 million classified within operating expenses the increase in net income attributable to generac holdings inc was primarily due to a prior year 407 million pretax noncash charge for the impairment of certain intangible assets partially offset by the business optimization charge discussed above and the other factors outlined in this section 

 

gross profit   gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2016 was 356 compared to 349 for the year ended december 31 2015 which includes the impact of the aforementioned 27 million of business optimization charges classified within cost of goods sold as well as 42 million of expense relating to the purchase accounting adjustment for the stepup in value of inventories relating to the pramac acquisition excluding the impact of these adjustments gross profit margin was 361 an improvement of 120 basis points over the prior year the increase was primarily due to the favorable impacts from lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger us dollar along with an overall favorable organic product mix in addition gross margin in the prior year was negatively impacted by temporary increases in certain costs associated with the west coast port congestion as well as other overheadrelated costs that did not repeat in the current year these factors were partially offset by the mix impact from the pramac acquisition 

 

operating expenses   excluding the impact of the aforementioned current year 44 million of business optimization charges and prior year 407 million of intangible impairment charges classified within operating expenses operating expenses increased 654 million or 273 to 3051 million for the year ended december 31 2016 from 2397 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily due to the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with recent acquisitions and increased amortization expense 

  

 

 

other expense   other expense in the prior year included a noncash 48 million loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from 1500 million of voluntary prepayments of term loan debt and a 24 million noncash loss resulting from an increase in our term loan interest rate spread of 25 basis points in the current year other expense included a 30 million noncash loss resulting from a continuation of the 25 basis point spread increase and a 06 million loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from a 250 million voluntary prepayment of term loan debt

adjusted ebitda   adjusted ebitda margins for the domestic segment for the year ended december 31 2016 were 223 of net sales as compared to 212 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2015 this increase was primarily due to overall favorable product mix lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger us dollar and the benefit of costreduction actions within domestic mobile products partially offset by increased promotional activities 

  

adjusted ebitda margins for the international segment for the year ended december 31 2016 were 63 of net sales as compared to 141 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2015 this decrease was primarily due to a large decline in mobile products margins given the reduced operating leverage on lower organic sales volume unfavorable sales mix foreign currency impacts with the weakness in the british pound and to a lesser extent the pramac acquisition sales mix

  

adjusted net income   adjusted net income of 1983 million for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased 01 from 1984 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the increased earnings outlined above were offset by an increase in cash income tax expense and adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

the following table sets forth our product class information for the periods indicated

 

  

net sales   the decrease in domestic sales for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to lower demand of home standby generators as a result of the significant decline in the power outage severity environment during 2015 and a reduction in shipments into oil  gas and general rental markets and to a lesser extent reduced shipments to telecom national account customers partially offsetting these impacts was the contribution from the chp acquisition 

 

the decrease in international sales for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation 

 

the contribution from nonannualized recent acquisitions to the year ended december 31 2015 was 628 million 

 

gross profit   gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased to 349 from 353 for the year ended december 31 2014 the decline in gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overheadrelated costs partially offset by the favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger us dollar 

 

operating expenses   operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 include a noncash 361 million impairment charge relating to tradenames as a result of a new brand strategy to transition and consolidate various brands to the generac® tradename and a noncash 46 million impairment charge relating to the writedown of the goodwill of the ottomotores reporting unit additionally operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 include a 49 million gain relating to a remeasurement of a contingent earnout obligation from the tower light acquisition excluding the impact of these items operating expenses increased 120 million primarily due to the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with the chp acquisition increased marketing and advertising expenses and a 26 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets this was partially offset by reductions in variable operating expenses on lower sales volumes 

 

other expense   the increase in other expense was primarily due to a 160 million noncash gain recorded in the year ended december 31 2014 relating to a 25 basis point reduction in borrowing costs as a result of the credit agreement leverage ratio falling below 30 times effective second quarter 2014 and remaining below 30 times based on projections at that time and a 24 million noncash loss recorded in the year ended december 31 2015 relating to a 25 basis point increase in borrowing costs as a result of our credit agreement leverage ratio rising above 30 times effective third quarter 2015 and remaining above 30 times based on projections at the time additionally 1500 million of voluntary prepayments of term loan debt were made in the year ended december 31 2015 resulting in a noncash 48 million loss on extinguishment of debt compared to voluntary prepayments of term loan debt of 870 million in the year ended december 31 2014 which resulted in a noncash 21 million loss on extinguishment of debt the debt repayments resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in interest expense of 44 million 

 

income tax expense   the effective tax rate for 2015 was 368 as compared to 324 for 2014 the increase in income tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the company’s federal domestic production activity deduction due to lower pretax income 

 

net income   as a result of the factors identified above we generated net income of 777 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 1746 million for the year ended december 31 2014 

 

adjusted ebitda   adjusted ebitda margins for the domestic segment for the year ended december 31 2015 were 212 of net sales as compared to 240 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2014 this decrease was primarily due to increased marketing and advertising expenses and reduced overall leverage of fixed operating expenses partially offset by the favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger us dollar 

  

adjusted ebitda margins for the international segment for the year ended december 31 2015 were 141 of net sales as compared to 123 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was primarily due to lower operating expenses 

  

 

 

adjusted net income   adjusted net income of 1984 million for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased 153 from 2342 million for the year ended december 31 2014 due to the factors outlined above partially offset by a decrease in cash income tax expense

critical accounting p olicies 

 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company including information about contingencies risk and financial condition the company believes given current facts and circumstances that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property and equipment and prepaid expenses management believes the company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment business combinations and purchase accounting defined benefit pension obligations estimates of product warranty and other contingencies income taxes and share based compensation 

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived i ntangible a ssets 

 

refer to note 2 “significant accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

the company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for the fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 and found no impairment following the 2016 and 2014 tests there were no reporting units with a carrying value atrisk of exceeding fair value as of the october 31 2016 impairment test date 

 

after performing the impairment tests for fiscal year 2015 the company determined that the fair value of the ottomotores reporting unit was less than its carrying value resulting in a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 46 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 the fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis which utilizes key estimates and assumptions as discussed below additionally in the fourth quarter of 2015 the company’s board of directors approved a plan to strategically transition and consolidate certain of the company’s brands acquired through acquisitions over the past several years to the generac® tradename this brand strategy change resulted in a reclassification to a two year remaining useful life for the impacted tradenames causing the fair value to be less than the carrying value using the relieffromroyalty approach in a discounted cash flow analysis as such a 361 million noncash impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 to writedown the impacted tradenames to net realizable value see note 2 “significant accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the impairment charges recorded in 2015 

 

when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing 

 

as noted above a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 

           

 

 

if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors the estimate of the fair values may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

 

business c ombinations and p urchase a ccounting 

 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values and the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions while the ultimate responsibility resides with management for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities including intangible assets and tangible longlived assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions the most significant being projected revenue growth rates earnings margins and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate see note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s business acquisitions 

  

defined benefit p ension o bligations 

 

t he company’s pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets such rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering factors including market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2016 used a discount rate of 414 for the salaried pension plan and 416 for the hourly pension plan our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of “aa” or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 

 

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service  no compensation increase is assumed in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation as the plans were frozen effective december 31 2008 further information regarding the funded status of our pension plans can be found in note 14 “benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations given this policy we expect to make 06 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2017 

 

product warranty reserves and other c ontingencies 

 

the reserves if any for product warranty  product liability litigation and customer rebates are factspecific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations historical experience and current and expected economic conditions further information on these reserves are reflected under notes 2 9 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

income t axes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740  income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 

 

 

 

in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the taxable income in prior carryback years scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment

we believe our distribution network is a competitive advantage that has strengthened over the last decade as a result of adding expanding and developing the various distribution channels through which we sell our products our network is well balanced with no customer providing more than 7 of our sales in 2015 

  

our overall dealer network which is located principally in the united states canada and latin america is the industrys largest network of factory direct independent generator contractors 

  

our residentiallight commercial dealer network sells installs and services our residential and light commercial products to end users we have increased our level of investment in recent years by focusing on a variety of initiatives to more effectively market and sell our home standby products and better align our dealer network with generac 

  

our industrial network consists of a combination of primary distributors as well as a support network of dealers serving the united states and canada the industrial distributors and dealers provide industrial and commercial end users with ongoing sales and product support our industrial distributors and dealers maintain the local relationships with commercial electrical contractors specifying engineers and national account regional buying offices in recent years we have been particularly focused on expanding our dealer network in latin america and other regions of the world in order to expand our international sales opportunities 

  

 

 

 

our retail distribution network includes thousands of locations and includes a variety of regional and national home improvement chains retailers clubs buying groups and farm supply stores these physical retail locations are supplemented by a number of catalog and ecommerce retailers this network primarily sells our residential standby portable and lightcommercial generators as well as our other engine powered tools the placement of our products at retail locations drives significant awareness for our brands and the automatic home standby product category

business strategy 

we have been executing on our “powering ahead” strategic plan which serves as the framework for the significant investments we have made to capitalize on the longterm growth prospects of generac as we continue to move the powering ahead plan into the future we are focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the same four key objectives 

  

growing the residential standby generator market as the leader in the home standby generator market it is incumbent upon us to continue to drive growth and increase the penetration rate of these products in households across the united states and canada central to this strategy is to increase the awareness availability and affordability of home standby generators ongoing power outage activity combined with expanding our residentiallight commercial dealer base and overall distribution in affected regions are key drivers in elevating the awareness of home standby generators over the long term we intend to continue to supplement these key growth drivers by focusing on a variety of strategic initiatives targeted toward generating more sales leads improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of a home standby system in addition we intend to continue to focus on innovation in this emerging product category and introduce new products into the marketplace with only approximately 35 penetration of the addressable market of homes in the united states which we define as singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2013 american housing survey for the united states we believe there are opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market 

  

gaining commercial and industrial market share our growth strategy for commercial and industrial power generation products is focused on incremental market share gains key to this objective are efforts to leverage our expanding platform of diesel and natural gas offerings by better optimizing our industrial distribution partners’ capabilities to market sell and support these products specifically we continue to pursue certain initiatives to expand our distributors interactions with engineering firms and electrical contractors responsible for specifying and selecting our products within ci power generation applications we are also committed to a number of initiatives to improve the overall specification rates for our products which should increase quoting activity and close rates for our industrial distributors in addition we will attempt to gain incremental market share through our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fueled backup power solutions while still a much smaller portion of the overall ci market we believe demand for these products continues to increase at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators as a result of their lower capital investment and operating costs 

  

diversifying end markets by expanding product offerings and services in recent years we have diversified our end markets with new product and service platforms much of this diversification has been achieved with our strategic acquisitions which gave access to several new products markets and customers as a result of these acquisitions we now have access to a broad lineup of mobile power products higheroutput generators and other engine powered tools including products that serve the oil  gas and other infrastructure power markets we are now a more balanced company relative to our residential product sales as compared to only five years ago as revenues for our ci products have expanded from 310 of total net sales in 2010 to 416 in 2015 as we continue to build upon our recent diversification efforts we intend to evaluate other products and services which we believe could further diversify our end markets either through organic initiatives or additional acquisitions 

 

 

 

  

expanding into new geographies during 2015 approximately 10 of our revenues were shipped to regions outside the us and canada given that the global market for power generation equipment is estimated to exceed 16 billion annually we believe there are growth opportunities for generac by expanding into new geographies prior to the acquisitions of ottomotores in 2012 located in latin america and tower light in 2013 located in europe these efforts had been mostly organic with the creation of a dedicated sales team and the addition of new distribution points around the globe with a focus in latin america the ottomotores and tower light acquisitions provide us with an enhanced platform and increased scale for our international growth initiatives and also accelerate our efforts to become a more global player in the markets for backup power and mobile power equipment as we look forward we intend to leverage these acquisitions while also evaluating other opportunities to expand into other regions of the world this is targeted to be accomplished through both organic initiatives and potential acquisitions and by establishing and developing additional distribution globally and building the generac brand internationally 

  

we believe the investments we have made to date due in part to our powering ahead strategy have helped to capitalize on the macro secular growth drivers for our business and are an important part of our efforts to diversify and globalize our business see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – business drivers and trends” for additional drivers that influence demand for our products and other trends affecting the markets that we serve 

  

manufacturing 

  

we operate several manufacturing plants distribution facilities and inventory warehouses located principally in the united states mexico italy and brazil totaling over three million square feet we maintain inventory warehouses in the united states that accommodate material storage and rapid response requirements of our customers 

  

in recent years we have added manufacturing capacity through investments in automation improved utilization and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint through organic means as well as through acquisitions we believe we have sufficient capacity to achieve our business goals for the neartointermediate term 

  

research and development 

  

our primary focus on power generation equipment and other engine powered products drives technological innovation specialized engineering and manufacturing competencies research and development is a core competency and includes a staf f of over 250 engineers working on numerous projects our sponsored research and development expense was 329 million 315 million and 293 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively research and development is conducted at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide and is focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements as well as maintaining product competitiveness by improving manufacturing costs safety characteristics reliability and performance while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards we have over 30 years of experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology in the residential and light commercial markets we have developed proprietary engines cooling packages controls fuel systems and emissions systems we believe that our expertise in engine powered equipment gives us the capability to develop new products that will allow continued diversification in our end markets 

  

intellectual property 

  

we are committed to research and development and we rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights our patents protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems air flow electronics and controls noise reduction and aircooled engines we believe the existence of these patents and trademarks along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position we also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment 

  

suppliers of raw materials 

  

our primary raw material inputs are steel copper and aluminum all of which are purchased from third parties and in many cases as part of machined or manufactured components we have developed an extensive network of reliable suppliers in the united states and internationally our strategic global sourcing function continuously evaluates the quality and cost structure of our products and assesses the capabilities of our supply chain components are sourced accordingly based on this evaluation our supplier quality engineers conduct onsite audits of major supply chain partners and help to maintain the reliability of critical sourced components in 2015 we sourced approximately 52 of our materials and components from outside the united states 

  

 

 

 

competition 

  

the market for power generation equipment and other engine powered products is competitive we face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers along with mobile equipment and engine powered tools providers both domestic and internationally however specifically in the generator market most of the traditional participants compete on a more specialized basis focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix we are the only significant market participant with a primary focus on power generation with a core emphasis on standby portable and mobile generators with broad capabilities across the residential light commercial industrial oil  gas and construction generator markets we believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a firstmover advantage over our competition for product innovation we also believe our broad product offering diverse distribution model and strong factory support provide additional advantages as well

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report 

  

risk factors related to our business and industry 

  

demand for the majority of our products is significantly affected by unpredictable poweroutage activity that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

  

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for the majority of our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts and other power grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location frequency and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the lack of major poweroutage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of poweroutage activity are part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products 

  

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses and other macroeconomic conditions 

  

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products at the same level if at all if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets 

  

 

 

 

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 

  

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 

  

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies which have substantially greater financial resources than we do some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for further information see “item 1—business—competition” 

  

our industry is subject to te chnological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures delayed introductions higher than expected production costs or may not be well accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label telecommunications retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

  

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large telecommunications retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors with whom we do business offer competitors’ products and services impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 

  

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

  

we consider our intellectual property rights to be important assets and seek to protect them through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to resolve and we might not ultimately prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 

  

 

 

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

  

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs we could also be subject to a recall action by regulatory authorities violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

  

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

  

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa carb and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines and requirements failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 

  

w e may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 

  

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability 

  

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

  

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

 

 

 

disruptions caused by labor dis putes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

  

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position a work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

  

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

  

      

in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius of each other we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 

  

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

  

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include 

  

            

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

  

we singlesource certain types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit weather events or natural disasters 

  

 

 

 

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries including but not limited to mexico  italy and brazil we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice s act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

  

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

  

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired net income could be materially adversely affected 

  

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names at december 31 2015 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 7980 million we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of operations a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

  

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 35020 intangibles – goodwill and other  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment and finitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances the amount of any impairment is recorded as a charge to the statement of operations we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of intangible assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” note 2 “significant accounting policies” and note 8 “goodwill and intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s impairment tests and the impairment of certain tradenames as a result of a new brand strategy and the impairment of the goodwill of the ottomotores reporting unit both recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 

  

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes of our products on our net sales 

  

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

  

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the combination of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

in addition the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others 

  

     

 

 

  

          

  

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

  

we may encounter difficulties in implementing or operating a new enterprise resource planning erp system which may adversely affect our operations and financial reportin g 

  

in january 2016 we implemented a new erp system for a majority of our business as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and strengthen our operational and financial processes and our reporting systems the erp system may not provide the benefits anticipated could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently all of which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

  

failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely heavily on information technology it both in our products and services for customers and in our it systems further we collect and store sensitive information in our data centers and on our networks government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers cybercriminals malicious insiders and other actors targeting confidential information and all types of it systems these actors may engage in fraudulent activities theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage 

 

our it systems and our confidential information may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses worms or other malicious software programs these attacks pose a risk to the security of the products systems and networks of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers as well to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks through controls due diligence training surveillance and other measures we remain vulnerable to information security threats

  

despite the precautions we take an intrusion or infection of our systems could result in the disruption of our business loss of proprietary or confidential information or injuries to people or property similarly an attack on our it systems could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property or a breach of confidential customer or employee information any such events could have an adverse impact on sales harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns as the threats evolve and become more potent we may incur additional costs to secure the products that we sell as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices 

  

 

 

 

risks related to our common stock 

  

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material 

  

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

  

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

  

      

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

we currently do not have plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

  

we currently do not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock we intend to use future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business as well as for repayment of outstanding debt and for share repurchases in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future while we may change this policy at some point in the future we cannot assure that we will make such a change 

  

risks related to our capital structure 

  

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 

  

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2015 we had total indebtedness of 10593 million our significant level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our significant indebtedness combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences for example it could 

  

          

 

 

  

any of the abovelisted factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate once above a certain libor floor if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 

  

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

  

our credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests these restrictions include among other things our ability to 

  

           

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants 

  

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit ou r ability to grow 

  

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies in the future if we are unable to refinance our credit facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “item 1 – business” “item 6  selected financial data” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those set forth under “item 1a  risk factors” 

  

overview 

  

we are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of power generation equipment and other engine powered products serving the residential light commercial industrial oil  gas and construction markets power generation is our primary focus which differentiates us from our primary competitors that also have broad operations outside of the power equipment market as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we are a market leader in the power equipment market in north america and have an expanding presence internationally we believe we have one of the widest range of products in the marketplace including residential commercial and industrial standby generators as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications other engine powered products that we design and manufacture include light towers which provide temporary lighting for various end markets commercial and industrial mobile heaters used in the oil  gas construction and other industrial markets and a broad product line of outdoor power equipment for residential and commercial use 

  

over the past several years we have executed a number of acquisitions that support our strategic plan a summary of these acquisitions can be found in note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

business drivers and operational factors 

  

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of business drivers and trends as well as operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 

  

 

 

 

business drivers and trends 

  

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power generation products mobile product solutions and other engine powered products by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important drivers and trends affecting our industry including the following 

  

increasing penetration opportunity many potential customers are not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for home standby generators are only approximately 35 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2013 american housing survey for the united states the decision to purchase backup power for many lightcommercial buildings such as convenience stores restaurants and gas stations is more returnoninvestment driven and as a result these applications have relatively lower penetration rates as compared to buildings used in codedriven or mission critical applications such as hospitals wastewater treatment facilities 911 call centers data centers and certain industrial locations the emergence of lower cost cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators has helped to increase the penetration of standby generators in the lightcommercial market in addition the importance of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure is increasing due to the growing importance for uninterrupted voice and data services also in recent years a more stringent regulatory environment around the flaring of natural gas at oil  gas drilling and production sites has been a catalyst for increased demand for natural gas fueled generators including mobile solutions we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby and mobile generators for residential commercial and industrial purposes 

  

effect of large scale and baseline power disruptions   power disruptions are an important driver of customer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators increased frequency and duration of major power outage events that have a broader impact beyond a localized level increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major power outage event for standby generators for example the multiple major outage events that occurred during the second half of both 2011 and 2012 drove strong demand for portable and home standby generators and the increased awareness of these products contributed to substantial organic revenue growth in 2012 with strong growth continuing during 2013 major power disruptions are unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period in addition there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently across the united states that drive the baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the level of baseline power outage activity occurring across the united states can also fluctuate and may cause our financial results to fluctuate from year to year 

  

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators is also affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income the value of their home and overall net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators trends in the new housing market highlighted by residential housing starts can also impact demand for our residential generators demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors as well as weather precipitation patterns 

  

impact of business capital investment cycle the market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by the overall capital investment cycle including nonresidential building construction durable goods and infrastructure spending as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil  gas as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial retail telecommunications industrial data centers healthcare construction oil  gas and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic conditions and credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve in addition we believe demand for our mobile power products will continue to benefit from a secular shift towards renting versus buying this type of equipment 

  

f actors affecting results of o perations 

  

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing and cost control certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following 

 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum and other components we use in our products together with foreign currency fluctuations can have a material impact on our results of operations we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of rising commodity currency and component prices through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 

  

 

 

 

seasonalit y  although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past three years approximately 23 to 27 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 22 to 25 in the second quarter 24 to 27 in the third quarter and 25 to 28 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the presence timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period for example there were multiple major power outage events that occurred during the second half of both 2011 and 2012 which were significant in terms of severity as a result the seasonality experienced during this time period and for the subsequent quarters following the time period varied relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred we maintain a flexible production and supply chain infrastructure in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand 

  

factors influencing interest expense and cash interest expense  interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements credit agreement pricing grids and repayments or borrowings of indebtedness cash interest expense decreased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to voluntary prepayments of term loan principal and the lower interest rate on our amended abl facility borrowings refer to note 10 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

  

factors influencing provision for income taxes and cash income taxes paid we had approximately 715 million of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december 31 2015 related to our acquisition by ccmp in 2006 that we expect to generate aggregate cash tax savings of approximately 279 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the recognition of the tax benefit associated with these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 48 million through 2020 and 40 million in 2021 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate as a result of the asset acquisition of the magnum business in the fourth quarter of 2011 we had approximately 420 million of incremental tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets remaining as of december 31 2015 we expect these assets to generate aggregate cash tax savings of 164 million through 2026 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 38 million annually through 2025 and 28 million in 2026 which generates an additional annual cash tax savings of 15 million through 2025 and 11 million in 2026 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2026 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes other domestic acquisitions have resulted in additional tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets that will generate tax savings but are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

components of net sales and expenses 

  

net s ales 

  

substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our power generator equipment and other engine powered products to the residential light commercial industrial oil  gas and construction markets we also sell engines to certain customers and service parts to our dealer network net sales which include shipping and handling charges billed to customers are generally recognized upon shipment of products to our customers related freight costs are included in cost of sales 

  

during 2015 our net sales were affected primarily by the us market as sales outside of the united states represented approximately 15 of total net sales 

  

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 7 of our sales and our top ten customers representing less than 25 of our total sales for the year ended december 31 2015 

  

costs of goods s old 

  

the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised approximately 84 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2015 the principal component parts are engines and alternators we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our generators up to 22kw we source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our diesel products for certain natural gas engines we source the base engine block and then add a significant amount of value engineering subsystems and other content to the point that we are recognized as the oem of those engines we design many of the alternators for our units and either manufacture or source alternators for certain of our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable high quality suppliers in some cases these relationships are proprietary 

  

the principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process that are sourced are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions however there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 

  

 

 

 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies support and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales 

  

operating e xpenses 

  

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our sales marketing distribution service parts engineering information systems human resources finance risk management legal and tax functions among others these expenses include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs and taxes and are classified into three categories selling and service research and development and general and administrative additionally the amortization expense related to our finitelived intangible assets is included within operating expenses

gross profit gross profit decreased 562 million or 109 to 4600 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from 5162 million for the year ended december 31 2014 gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased to 349 from 353 for the year ended december 31 2014 the decline in gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overheadrelated costs partially offset by the favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger us dollar 

  

operating expenses operating expenses increased 576 million to 2804 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from 2228 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the current year operating expenses include a noncash 361 million impairment charge relating to tradenames as a result of a new brand strategy to transition and consolidate various brands to the generac® tradename and a noncash 46 million impairment charge relating to the writedown of the goodwill of the ottomotores reporting unit additionally the prior year operating expenses include a 49 million gain relating to a remeasurement of a contingent earnout obligation from an acquisition excluding the impact of these items operating expenses increased 120 million primarily due to the addition of recurring operating expenses associated with recent acquisitions increased marketing and advertising expenses and a 26 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets this was partially offset by reductions in variable operating expenses on lower sales volumes 

  

 

 

 

other expense other expense increased 216 million or 616 to 566 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from 350 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase was primarily due to a prior year 160 million noncash gain relating to a 25 basis point reduction in borrowing costs as a result of our net debt leverage ratio falling below 30 times at march 31 2014 and a current year 24 million noncash loss relating to a 25 basis point increase in borrowing costs as a result of our net debt leverage ratio moving back above 30 times at june 30 2015 additionally 1500 million of voluntary prepayments of term loan debt were made in the current year resulting in a noncash 48 million loss on extinguishment of debt compared to voluntary prepayments of term loan debt of 870 million in the prior year which resulted in a noncash 21 million loss on extinguishment of debt the debt repayments resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in interest expense of 44 million 

  

income tax expense income tax expense decreased 385 million to 452 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from 837 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the effective tax rate for 2015 was 368 as compared to 324 for 2014 the increase in income tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the company’s federal domestic production activity deduction due to lower pretax income 

  

net income as a result of the factors identified above we generated net income of 777 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 1746 million for the year ended december 31 2014

liquidity and financial position 

  

our primary cash requirements include payment for our raw material and component supplies salaries  benefits operating expenses interest and principal payments on our debt and capital expenditures we finance our operations primarily through cash flow generated from operations and if necessary borrowings under our amended abl facility 

  

the company’s credit agreements provide for a 12 billion term loan and include a 3000 million uncommitted incremental term loan facility the term loan matures on may 31 2020 the term loan initially bore interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of 175 or adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin of 275 subject to a libor floor of 075 beginning in the second quarter of 2014 and measured each subsequent quarter thereafter the applicable margin related to base rate loans is reduced to 150 and the applicable margin related to libor rate loans is reduced to 250 to the extent that the company’s net debt leverage ratio as defined in the term loan is below 300 to 100 for that measurement period the company’s net debt leverage ratio as of december 31 2015 was above 300 to 100 as of december 31 2015 the company is in compliance with all covenants of the term loan there are no financial maintenance covenants on the term loan 

  

the company’s credit agreements also provide for the 2500 million amended abl facility the maturity date of the amended abl facility is may 29 2020 in may 2015 the company borrowed 1000 million under the amended abl facility the proceeds of which were used as a voluntary prepayment of term loan borrowings as of december 31 2015 there was 1000 million outstanding under the amended abl facility and the company is in compliance with all of its covenants 

  

 

 

  

at december 31 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1159 million and 1485 million of availability under our revolving abl credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit 

  

on august 5 2015 the company’s board of directors approved a 2000 million stock repurchase program under the program the company may repurchase up to 2000 million of its common stock over 24 months from time to time in amounts and at prices the company deems appropriate subject to market conditions and other considerations the repurchase may be executed using open market purchases privately negotiated agreements or other transactions the actual timing number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management at its direction and will depend on a number of factors including the market price of the company’s shares of common stock and general market and economic conditions applicable legal requirements and compliance with the terms of the company’s outstanding indebtedness the repurchases will be funded from cash on hand or available borrowings the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice for the year ended december 31 2015 the company repurchased 3303500 shares of its common stock for 999 million funded with cash on hand 

  

refer to note 10 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

longterm liquidity 

  

we believe that our cash flow from operations and availability under our amended abl facility combined with relatively low ongoing capital expenditure requirements and favorable tax attributes which result in a lower cash tax rate as compared to the us statutory tax rate  provide us with sufficient capital to continue to grow our business in the future we will use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on our outstanding debt as well as repurchase shares of our common stock impacting the amount available for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes as we continue to expand our business we may require additional capital to fund working capital capital expenditures or acquisitions

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company including information about contingencies risk and financial condition the company believes given current facts and circumstances that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property and equipment and prepaid expenses management believes the company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment business combinations and purchase accounting defined benefit pension obligations estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty and other contingencies income taxes and share based compensation 

  

 

 

 

goodwill and other i ntangible a ssets 

  

see note 2 “significant accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

the company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill as of october 31 2015 and determined that the fair value of the ottomotores reporting unit was less than its carrying value resulting in a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 46 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 the fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis which utilizes key estimates and assumptions as discussed below there were no other reporting units with a carrying value atrisk of exceeding fair value as of the october 31 2015 impairment test date 

  

additionally in the fourth quarter of 2015 the company’s board of directors approved a plan to strategically transition and consolidate certain of the company’s brands acquired through acquisitions over the past several years to the generac® tradename this brand strategy change resulted in a reclassification to a two year remaining useful life for the impacted tradenames causing the fair value to be less than the carrying value using the relieffromroyalty approach in a discounted cash flow analysis as such a 361 million noncash impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 to writedown the impacted tradenames to net realizable value 

  

other than the impairment charges discussed above the company found no other impairment when performing the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 see note 2 “significant accounting policies – goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 

  

when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing 

  

as noted above a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

  

            

if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors the estimate of the fair values may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

  

business c ombinations and p urchase a ccounting 

  

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values and the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions while the ultimate responsibility resides with management for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities including intangible assets and tangible longlived assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions the most significant being projected revenue growth rates earnings margins and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate see note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s business acquisitions

  

 

 

 

defined benefit p ension o bligations 

  

the company’s pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets such rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering factors including market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2015 used a discount rate of 436 for the salaried pension plan and 439 for the hourly pension plan our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of “aa” or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 

  

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service no compensation increase is assumed in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation as the plans were frozen effective december 31 2008 further information regarding the funded status of our pension plans can be found in note 14 “benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations given this policy we expect to make 07 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2016 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts excess  obsolete i nventory reserves product warranty reserves and other c ontingencies 

  

the reserves if any for customer rebates product warranty product liability litigation excess and obsolete inventory and doubtful accounts are factspecific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations historical experience and current and expected economic conditions further information on these reserves are reflected under notes 2 7 9 16 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

income t axes 

  

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 

  

our balance sheet includes significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the taxable income in prior carryback years scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 

  

generac brazil acquired in the ottomotores acquisition in december 2012 is in a threeyear cumulative net loss position due to the startup nature of the business and therefore we have not considered expected future taxable income in analyzing the realizability of its deferred tax assets as of december 31 2015 as a result a full valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets of generac brazil 

  

in performing the assessment of the realization of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2015 excluding generac brazil we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance is required 

 

see note 13 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s income taxes

  

 

 

  

share based c ompensation 

  

under the fair value recognition provisions of asc 718 compensation – stock compensation  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends and market volatility of our stock in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted see note 15 “share plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s share based compensation

we believe our growth over the last several years is due in part to the development and execution of our powering ahead” strategy since shortly after our initial public offering in 2010 this strategic plan has served as the framework for the significant investments we have made to drive the growth of generac as we continue to move the powering ahead plan into the future we are focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the same four key objectives 

  

growing the residential standby generator market as the leader in the home standby generator category it is incumbent upon us to continue to drive growth and increase the penetration rate of these products in households across the united states and canada central to this strategy is to increase the awareness availability and affordability of home standby generators ongoing power outage activity combined with expanding our residentiallight commercial dealer base and overall distribution in affected regions are key drivers in elevating the awareness of home standby generators over the long term we intend to continue to supplement these key growth drivers by further optimizing our innovative sales and marketing techniques introduced in recent years to further extend the awareness of home standby generators in addition we intend to continue to focus on innovation in this emerging product category and introduce new products into the marketplace with only approximately 35 penetration of the addressable market of us homes which we define as singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2013 american housing survey for the united states we believe there are opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market 

  

gaining commercial and industrial market share our growth strategy for commercial and industrial power generation products is focused on incremental market share gains key to this objective are our efforts to develop and improve our industrial distribution further increase our addressable market with new products and increase the rate at which our products are specified in ci power generation applications in addition we will attempt to gain incremental market share through our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fueled backup power solutions while still a much smaller portion of the overall ci market we believe demand for these products continues to increase at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators as a result of their lower capital investment and operating costs we also believe there is an opportunity to provide smaller more cost effective generators marketed aggressively towards the underpenetrated “optional” standby generator market which includes smaller footprint commercial buildings 

  

diversifying end markets by expanding product offerings and services in recent years we have diversified our end markets with new product and service platforms much of this diversification has been achieved with our strategic acquisitions over the last four years we now have access to several new products new markets and new customers through the purchase of magnum in october 2011 ottomotores in december 2012 tower light in august 2013  baldor generators in november 2013 and mac in october 2014 as a result of these acquisitions we now have access to a broader lineup of mobile power products and higheroutput generators including products that serve the oil  gas and other infrastructure power markets we are now a more balanced company relative to our residential product sales as compared to only four years ago as revenues for our ci products have expanded from 310 of total net sales in 2010 to 446 in 2014 additionally our reentry into the market for power washers in 2011 allowed us to further diversify our company with the addition of this platform as we continue to build upon our recent diversification efforts we intend to evaluate other products and services which we believe could further diversify our end markets 

  

 

 

  

expanding into new geographies during 2014 approximately 9 of our revenues were shipped to regions outside the us and canada given that the global market for power generation equipment is estimated to exceed 16 billion annually we believe there are growth opportunities for generac by expanding into new geographies prior to 2012 these efforts had been mostly organic with the creation of a dedicated sales team and the addition of new distribution points around the globe with a focus in latin america the acquisitions of ottomotores located in latin america and tower light located in europe provide us with an enhanced platform and immediate scale for our international growth initiatives and also accelerate our efforts to become a more global player in the markets for backup power and mobile power equipment as we look forward we expect to drive growth in the key markets they serve with additional investment and focus and we intend to leverage these acquisitions while also evaluating other opportunities to expand into other regions of the world this is targeted to be accomplished through both organic growth and potential acquisitions and by establishing and developing additional distribution globally and building the generac brand internationally 

  

we believe the investments we have made to date due in part to our powering ahead strategy have helped to capitalize on the macro secular growth drivers for our business and are an important part of our efforts to diversify and globalize our business see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business drivers and trends” for additional drivers that influence demand for our products and other trends affecting the markets that we serve 

  

manufacturing 

  

we operate several manufacturing plants distribution facilities and inventory warehouses located principally in the united states mexico italy and brazil totaling over three and a half million square feet we maintain inventory warehouses in the united states that accommodate material storage and rapid response requirements of our customers 

  

in recent years we have added manufacturing capacity through investments in automation improved utilization and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint through organic means as well as through acquisitions we believe we have sufficient capacity to achieve our business goals for the neartointermediate term 

  

research and development 

  

our primary focus on generators and engine powered equipment drives technological innovation specialized engineering and manufacturing competencies research and development is a core competency and includes a staf f of over 250 engineers working on numerous active projects our sponsored research and development expense was 315 million 293 million and 235 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively research and development is conducted at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide and is focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements as well as maintaining product competitiveness by improving manufacturing costs safety characteristics reliability and performance while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards we have over 30 years of experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology in the residential and light commercial markets we have developed proprietary engines cooling packages controls fuel systems and emissions systems we believe that our expertise in engine powered equipment gives us the capability to develop new products that will allow continued diversification in our end markets 

  

intellectual property 

 

we rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights our commitment to research and development has resulted in a portfolio of over 170 us and international patents and patent applications our patents expire between 2015 and 2032 and protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems air flow electronics and controls noise reduction and aircooled engines newly issued us patents generally have a life of 20 years from the date the patent application is initially filed us and international trademark registrations generally have a perpetual duration if they are properly maintained and renewed we believe the existence of these patents and trademarks along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position we also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment 

  

suppliers of raw materials 

  

our primary raw material inputs are steel copper and aluminum all of which are purchased from third parties and in many cases as part of machined or manufactured components we have developed an extensive network of reliable suppliers in the united states and abroad our strategic global sourcing function continuously evaluates the quality and cost structure of our products and assesses the capabilities of our supply chain components are sourced accordingly based on this evaluation our supplier quality engineers conduct onsite audits of major supply chain partners and help to maintain the reliability of critical sourced components in 2014 we sourced approximately 55 of our materials and components from outside the united states 

  

 

 

  

competition 

  

the market for power generation equipment and other engine powered products is competitive we face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers and mobile equipment providers both domestic and internationally however specifically in the generator market most of the traditional participants compete on a more specialized basis focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix we are the only significant market participant with a primary focus on power generation with a core emphasis on standby portable and mobile generators with broad capabilities across the residential light commercial industrial oil  gas and construction generator markets we believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a firstmover advantage over our competition for product innovation we also believe our broad product offering diverse distribution model and strong factory support provide additional advantages as well

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report 

  

risk factors related to our business and industry 

  

demand for our products is significantly affected by unpredictable poweroutage activity that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

  

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts and other power grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location frequency and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory in addition there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the lack of major poweroutage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of poweroutage activity are part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products 

  

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses and other macroeconomic conditions 

  

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets 

  

 

 

 

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 

  

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 

  

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies and have substantially greater financial resources some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for further information see “item 1—business—competition” 

  

our industry is subject to te chnological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures their introduction may be delayed they may have higher production costs than originally expected or they may not be accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label telecommunications retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

  

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large telecommunications retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors and customers with whom we do business offer products and services of our competitors impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 

  

 

 

  

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

  

we view our intellectual property rights as very important assets we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to resolve and we may not ultimately prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 

  

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements furthermore in connection with our sale of generac portable products to a private equity firm in 1998 we granted the private equity firm an exclusive perpetual license for the use of the “generac portable products” trademark in connection with the manufacture and sale of certain engine driven consumer products this perpetual license was eventually transferred to another company when the private equity firm sold that business currently this trademark is not being used in commerce and as such there is a rebuttable presumption that the trademark has been abandoned however in the event that this trademark is used in the future we could suffer competitive confusion and our business could be negatively impacted 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

  

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

  

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

  

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa carb and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example  we were required to modify our sparkignited aircooled gaseous engines to comply with the 2011 epa and carb regulations as well as the continued implementation of tier 4 nonroad diesel engine changes associated with acquisitions serving the mobile product markets typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 

  

w e may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 

  

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability 

  

 

 

 

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

  

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

disruptions caused by labor dis putes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position a work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

  

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

  

      

in addition the majority of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius of each other we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 

  

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

  

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include 

  

            

 

 

  

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

 

we singlesource certain types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit weather events or natural disasters 

  

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries including but not limited to mexico  italy and brazil we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice s act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

  

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries including but not limited to mexico italy and brazil we are subject to the regulations imposed by a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

  

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired in the future net income could be materially adversely affected 

  

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names at december 31 2014 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 8182 million most of which arose from the ccmp transaction we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of operations a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

  

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 35020 intangibles  goodwill and other  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment and definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances the amount of any impairment is recorded as a charge to the statement of operations we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of intangible assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information on the company’s impairment tests and atrisk goodwill for the ottomotores reporting unit and see note 2 “significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details 

  

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes of our products on our net sales 

  

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales 

  

 

 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

  

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the combination of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

in addition the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline 

  

the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others 

  

               

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive information in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings regulatory penalties disrupt our operations and damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business 

 

risks related to our common stock 

  

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material 

  

 

 

  

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

  

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

  

      

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

we currently do not have plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

  

while we declared a special dividend in both june 2012 and june 2013 we currently do not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock we intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of outstanding debt in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future while we may change this policy at some point in the future we cannot assure that we will make such a change 

  

risks related to our capital structure 

  

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 

  

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2014 we had total indebtedness of 10827 million our significant level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our significant indebtedness combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences for example it could 

  

        

any of the abovelisted factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate once above a certain libor floor if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 

  

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

  

our credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests these restrictions include among other things our ability to 

  

           

 

 

    

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants 

  

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit ou r ability to grow 

  

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies on may 31 2013 we amended and restated our term loan credit agreement pursuant to which we incurred 1200 million of a senior secured term loan which matures in 2020 to replace our prior 900 million term loan facility in the future if we are unable to refinance such facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected

overview 

  

we are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of power generation equipment and other engine powered products serving the residential light commercial industrial oil  gas and construction markets power generation is our primary focus which differentiates us from our primary competitors that also have broad operations outside of the generator market as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the power equipment market in north america and an expanding presence internationally we believe we have one of the widest range of products in the marketplace including residential commercial and industrial standby generators as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications other engine powered products that we design and manufacture include light towers which provide temporary lighting for various end markets commercial and industrial mobile heaters used in the oil  gas construction and other industrial markets and a broad product line of power washers for residential and commercial use 

  

over the past several years we have executed a number of acquisitions that support our strategic plan a summary of these acquisitions can be found in note 1 “description of business” to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

business drivers and operational factors 

  

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of business drivers and trends as well as operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 

  

business drivers and trends 

  

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power generation and other mobile product solutions by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important drivers and trends affecting our industry including the following 

  

 

 

  

increasing penetration opportunity many potential customers are not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for home standby generators are only approximately 35 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2013 american housing survey for the united states the decision to purchase backup power for many lightcommercial buildings such as convenience stores restaurants and gas stations is more returnoninvestment roi driven and as a result these applications have relatively lower penetration rates as compared to buildings used in codedriven or mission critical applications such as hospitals wastewater treatment facilities 911 call centers data centers and certain industrial locations the emergence of lower cost cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators has helped to accelerate the penetration of standby generators in the lightcommercial market in addition the importance of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure is increasing due to the growing importance for uninterrupted voice and data services also in recent years a more stringent regulatory environment around the flaring of natural gas at oil  gas drilling and production sites has been a catalyst for increased demand for natural gas fueled generators including mobile solutions we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby and mobile generators for residential commercial and industrial purposes 

  

effect of large scale and baseline power disruptions   power disruptions are an important driver of customer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators increased frequency and duration of major power outage events that have a broader impact beyond a localized level increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months for standby generators for example the multiple major outage events that occurred during the second half of both 2011 and 2012 drove strong demand for portable and home standby generators and the increased awareness of these products contributed to substantial organic revenue growth in 2012 with strong growth continuing during 2013 major power disruptions are unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period in addition there are smaller more localized power outages that occur frequently across the us that drive the baseline level of demand for backup power solutions the level of baseline power outage activity occurring across the us can also fluctuate and may cause our financial results to fluctuate from year to year 

  

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators is also affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income the value of their home and overall net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators trends in the new housing market highlighted by residential housing starts can also impact demand for our residential products 

  

impact of business capital investment cycle the market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by the overall capital investment cycle including nonresidential building construction durable goods and infrastructure spending as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil  gas as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial retail telecommunications industrial data centers healthcare construction oil  gas and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic conditions and credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve in addition we believe demand for our mobile power products will continue to benefit from a secular shift towards renting versus buying this type of equipment 

  

f actors affecting results of o perations 

  

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing and cost control certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following 

 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum and other components we use in our products together with foreign currency fluctuations can have a material impact on our results of operations we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of rising commodity currency and component prices through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are borne by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 

 

seasonalit y although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past three years approximately 23 to 27 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 20 to 25 in the second quarter 24 to 26 in the third quarter and 25 to 29 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the presence timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period for example there were multiple major power outage events that occurred during the second half of both 2011 and 2012 which were significant in terms of severity as a result the seasonality experienced during this time period and for the subsequent quarters following the time period varied relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred we maintain a flexible production and supply chain infrastructure in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand 

  

 

 

  

factors influencing interest expense and cash interest expense  interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements and repayments of indebtedness cash interest expense decreased during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a reduction in interest rate from the credit agreement refinancing completed in may 2013 and the 25 basis point reduction in borrowing costs during the second quarter of 2014 as a result of our net debt leverage ratio as defined in our new term loan credit agreement falling below 30 times refer to note 11 “credit agreements” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional details 

  

factors influencing provision for income taxes and cash income taxes paid we had approximately 837 million of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december 31 2014 related to our acquisition by ccmp in 2006 that we expect to generate cash tax savings of approximately 326 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the recognition of the tax benefit associated with these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 48 million through 2020 and 40 million in 2021 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate as a result of the asset acquisition of the magnum business in the fourth quarter of 2011 we had approximately 455 million of incremental tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets remaining as of december 31 2014 we expect these assets to generate cash tax savings of 178 million through 2026 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 38 million annually through 2025 and 28 million in 2026 which generates an additional annual cash tax savings of 15 million through 2025 and 11 million in 2026 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2026 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes other domestic acquisitions have resulted in additional tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets that will generate tax savings but are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

in the second quarter of 2013 the dividend recapitalization discussed under “liquidity and financial position” was completed after considering the increased debt and related interest expense the company believes it will still generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax attributes discussed above 

  

transactions with ccmp 

  

in november 2006 affiliates of ccmp together with certain other investors and members of our management purchased an aggregate of 689 million of our equity capital in addition on november 10 2006 generac power systems borrowed an aggregate of 138 billion consisting of an initial drawdown of 950 million under a 11 billion first lien secured credit facility and 430 million under a 430 million second lien secured credit facility with the proceeds from these equity and debt financings together with cash on hand at generac power systems we 1 acquired all of the capital stock of generac power systems and repaid certain pretransaction indebtedness of generac power systems for 20 billion 2 paid 66 million in transaction costs related to the transaction and 3 retained 3 million for general corporate purposes subsequently during 2007 2008 and 2009 affiliates of ccmp acquired approximately 2492 million of second lien term loans and 99 million of first lien term loans for approximately 1559 million ccmp’s affiliates then exchanged this debt for additional shares of thenexisting class b common stock and series a preferred stock which were subsequently converted into the same class of our common stock through a corporate reorganization in conjunction with the ipo in february 2010 

  

in august 2013 ccmp completed the last of a series of sale transactions that began in november 2012 by which it sold substantially all of the shares of common stock that it owned as of the ipo 

  

initial public offering 

  

on february 17 2010 the company completed its ipo of 18750000 shares of its common stock at a price of 1300 per share in addition the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 1950500 shares of the company’s common stock from the company on march 18 2010 we received a total of approximately 2479 million in net proceeds from the initial public offering and underwriters’ option exercise after deducting the underwriting discounts and expenses all shares sold in this offering were primary shares immediately following the ipo and underwriters’ option exercise we had 67529290 total shares of common stock outstanding 

  

components of net sales and expenses 

  

net s ales 

 

substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our generators and other engine powered products for the residential light commercial industrial oil  gas and construction markets we also sell engines to certain customers and service parts to our dealer network net sales which include shipping and handling charges billed to customers are generally recognized upon shipment of products to our customers related freight costs are included in cost of sales 

  

 

 

  

during 2014 our net sales were affected primarily by the us market as sales outside of the united states represented approximately 16 of total net sales 

  

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 8 of our sales for the year ended december 31 2014 and our top ten customers representing less than 26 of our sales for the same period 

  

costs of goods s old 

  

the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised over 85 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2014 the principal component parts are engines and alternators we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our products up to 22kw we source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our products larger than 22kw for natural gas engines we are recognized as the oem we design all the alternators for our units and manufacture alternators for certain of our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable high quality suppliers in some cases these relationships are proprietary 

  

the principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process that are sourced are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions however there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 

  

other sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies support and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales 

  

operating e xpenses 

  

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our sales marketing distribution service parts engineering information systems human resources finance risk management legal and tax functions these expenses include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs and taxes and are classified into three categories selling and service research and development and general and administrative additionally the amortization expense related to our finitelived intangible assets is included within operating expenses

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 

 

  

   

net sales net sales decreased 249 million or 17 to 14609 million for the year ended december 31 2014 from 14858 million for the year ended december 31 2013 residential product sales decreased 144 to 7222 million from 8437 million for the comparable period in 2013 residential product sales declined on a yearoveryear basis as the prior year benefited from approximately 140 million in incremental shipments as a result of satisfying the extended lead times that resulted from superstorm sandy in october 2012 which did not repeat in 2014 excluding this benefit in the prior year residential products increased approximately 3 ci product sales increased 144 to 6522 million from 5699 million for the comparable period in 2013 primarily due to the contributions from recent acquisitions along with strength in the oil  gas markets partially offset by reduced capital spending from certain telecom customers and overall softness within latin america 

 

gross profit gross profit decreased 534 million or 94 to 5162 million for the year ended december 31 2014 from 5696 million for the year ended december 31 2013 gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2014 decreased to 353 from 383 for the year ended december 31 2013 the decline in gross margin was driven by the combination of a higher mix of organic ci product shipments the impact of recent acquisitions an increase in promotional activities in the current year and an overall increase in product costs including a temporary increase in certain costs associated with the slowdown of activity in west coast ports as well as shortterm increases in other overheadrelated costs 

  

 

 

 

operating expenses operating expenses increased 47 million to 2228 million for the year ended december 31 2014 from 2181 million for the year ended december 31 2013 operating expenses increased primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions a more favorable adjustment to warranty reserves in 2013 as compared to the current year and increased marketing and advertising expenses to support our powering ahead strategy these increases were partially offset by a 49 million gain recorded in the second quarter of 2014 relating to a remeasurement of a contingent earnout obligation from a recent acquisition and a 48 million yearoveryear decline in amortization of intangible assets 

 

other expense other expense decreased 377 million or 519 to 350 million for the year ended december 31 2014 from 727 million for the year ended december 31 2013 beginning in the second quarter of 2014 there was a 25 basis point reduction in borrowing costs as a result of the company’s net debt leverage ratio falling below 30 times resulting in a 160 million noncash gain being recorded in 2014 in conjunction with the may 2013 refinancing and other debt prepayments made in the prior year a 153 million loss on extinguishment of debt was recorded during 2014 870 million of voluntary prepayments of term loan debt were made which resulted in recording a 21 million loss on extinguishment of debt additionally there was a 72 million yearoveryear decrease in interest expense due to the refinancing of our debt in may 2013

net sales net sales increased 3095 million or 263 to 14858 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from 11763 million for the year ended december 31 2012 residential product sales increased 196 to 8437 million from 7054 million for the comparable period in 2012 the increase in residential product sales was primarily driven by increases in shipments for home standby generators due to a combination of factors including the additional awareness and adoption of our products created by major power outages in recent years including superstorm sandy in 2012 the company’s expanded distribution increased sales and marketing initiatives overall strong operational execution and an improving environment for residential investment the strength in home standby generators was partially offset by a decline in shipments of portable generators due to less severe power outage events relative to the prior year in addition increased revenue from power washer products contributed to the yearoveryear sales growth in residential products ci product sales increased 389 to 5699 million from 4103 million for the comparable period in 2012 the increase was driven by the impact of recent acquisitions along with strong organic growth for stationary and mobile generators the increase in organic revenues was primarily driven by strong shipments to national account customers and increased sales of natural gas generators used in light commercial applications 

 

gross profit gross profit increased 1292 million or 293 to 5696 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from 4404 million for the year ended december 31 2012 gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to 383 from 374 for the year ended december 31 2012 this gross margin improvement reflects improved product mix improved pricing and a moderation in product costs due to lower commodity prices and execution of cost reduction initiatives these margin improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from recent acquisitions  

 

operating expenses operating expenses increased 13 million to 2181 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from 2168 million for the year ended december 31 2012 this increase resulted from the impact of recent acquisitions as well as increased sales engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher sales levels of the company these increases were mostly offset by warranty rate improvements resulting in a 176 million favorable adjustment to warranty reserves driven by better claims experience which impacted selling and service expense as well as a decline in the amortization of intangibles 

 

other expense other expense increased 55 million or 83 to 727 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from 672 million for the year ended december 31 2012 these additional expenses were primarily driven by a 53 million increase in interest expense due to the higher debt levels from the may 2012 and 2013 refinancing transactions partially offset by a slight reduction in interest rate on the new credit facility 

 

income tax expense income tax expense increased 411 million to 1042 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from 631 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase was primarily driven by the increase in pretax income during 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by a lower effective tax rate the decrease in the effective income tax rate yearoveryear is primarily due to the lower tax rate of a foreign subsidiary acquired during the fourth quarter of 2012 and the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in 2013

longterm liquidity 

  

we believe that our cash flow from operations and our availability under our revolving credit facility combined with relatively low ongoing capital expenditure requirements and favorable tax attributes which result in a lower cash tax rate as compared to the us statutory tax rate  provide us with sufficient capital to continue to grow our business in the future we will use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on our outstanding debt impacting the amount available for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes as we continue to expand our business we may require additional capital to fund working capital capital expenditures or acquisitions

our operations require capital expenditures for technology tooling equipment capacity expansion and upgrades capital expenditures were 347 million and 308 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively and were funded through cash from operations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for selected dealers this arrangement provides liquidity for our dealers by financing dealer purchases of products with credit availability from the finance company we receive payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer and our dealers are given a longer period of time to pay the finance provider if our dealers do not pay the finance company we may be required to repurchase the applicable inventory held by the dealer we do not indemnify the finance company for any credit losses they may incur

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company including information about contingencies risk and financial condition the company believes given current facts and circumstances that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property plant and equipment and prepaid expenses management believes the company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment business combinations and purchase accounting defined benefit pension obligations estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty and other contingencies derivative accounting income taxes and share based compensation 

  

goodwill and other i ntangible a ssets 

  

see note 2 “significant accounting policies  goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 and found no impairment 

  

when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing 

  

in our october 31 2014 impairment test calculation the ottomotores reporting unit had an estimated fair value that was approximately equal to carrying value the carrying value of the ottomotores goodwill was approximately 46 million as of december 31 2014 key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the reporting unit includes revenue growth levels that reflect a recovery of latin american economies impacts of mexican energy reform improving profit margins a 3 terminal growth rate and a 168 discount rate a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate results in a decrease to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit of approximately 4 while a reduction in the sales continuous annual growth rate of 100 basis points would decrease the estimated fair value by approximately 3 as of the october 31 2014 impairment test date there were no other reporting units with a carrying value that was at risk of exceeding its fair value 

  

 

 

  

as noted above a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

  

            

if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors the estimate of the fair values may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

  

business c ombinations and p urchase a ccounting 

  

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values and the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions while the ultimate responsibility resides with management for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities including intangible assets and tangible longlived assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions the most significant being projected revenue growth rates earnings margins and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate 

  

defined benefit p ension o bligations 

  

the company’s pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2014 used a discount rate of 397 for the salaried pension plan and 399 for the hourly pension plan our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of “aa” or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 

  

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service no compensation increase is assumed in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation as the plans were frozen effective december 31 2008 further information regarding the funded status of our pension plans can be found in note 14 “benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations given this policy we expect to make 12 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2015 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts excess  obsolete i nventory reserves product warranty reserves and other c ontingencies 

  

the reserves if any for customer rebates product warranty product liability litigation excess and obsolete inventory and doubtful accounts are factspecific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations historical experience and current and expected economic conditions further information on these reserves are reflected under notes 2 8 10 16 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

 

  

derivative accounting 

  

see note 2 “significant accounting policies  derivative instruments and hedging activities” and note 4 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the company’s policy and assumptions related to derivative accounting 

  

income t axes 

  

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 

 

our balance sheet includes significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the taxable income in prior carryback years scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 

 

generac brazil acquired in the ottomotores acquisition in december 2012 is in a threeyear cumulative net loss position due to the startup nature of the business and therefore we have not considered expected future taxable income in analyzing the realizability of its deferred tax assets as of december 31 2014 as a result a full valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets of generac brazil 

  

in performing the assessment of the realization of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2014 excluding generac brazil we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance is required 

  

share based c ompensation 

  

under the fair value recognition provisions of asc 718 compensation  stock compensation  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends and market volatility of our stock in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 

  

new accounting standards 

 

for information with respect to new accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements see note 2 “significant accounting policies  new accounting pronouncements” to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates to reduce the risk from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we use financial instruments from time to time we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

foreign currency 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of purchasing from suppliers in currency other than the us dollar as well as operating businesses in foreign countries periodically we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases in the normal course of business contracts typically have maturities of one year or less realized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold on the statements of comprehensive income 

  

 

 

    

as of december 31 2014 we had the following foreign currency contracts outstanding in thousands 

  

   

with the purchase of the ottomotores business in december 2012 and the tower light business in august 2013 a small portion of revenues and expenses are now denominated in euros mexican pesos brazilian real and british pounds 

  

commodity prices 

 

we are a purchaser of commodities and of components manufactured from commodities including steel aluminum copper and others as a result we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process depending on the supplier these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies or supply chain savings to offset increases in commodity costs 

  

periodically we engage in certain commodity risk management activities the primary objectives of these activities are to understand and mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results generally these risk management transactions will involve the use of commodity derivatives to protect against exposure resulting from significant price fluctuations 

  

we primarily utilize commodity contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months these contracts are intended to offset the effect of price fluctuations on actual inventory purchases and to mitigate the impact on our financial results as of december 31 2014 we had the following commodity forward contracts outstanding in thousands 

  

   

for additional information on the company’s commodity forward contracts including amounts charged to the statement of comprehensive income during 2014 see note 4 “derivative instruments and hedging activity” to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

at december 31 2014 the fair value of the swaps was a liability of 10 million for additional information on the company’s interest rate swaps including amounts charged to the statement of comprehensive income during 2014 see note 4 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” and “note 6 accumulated other comprehensive loss” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k even after giving effect to these swaps we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our term loans that are not covered by the swaps a hypothetical change in the libor interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed annual cash interest expense by approximately 41 million or without the swaps in place 56 million in 2014 the existence of a 075 libor floor provision in our new term loan credit agreement effective may 31 2013 limits the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point change in libor at current december 31 2014 libor rates

we believe our distribution network is a competitive advantage that has strengthened over the last decade as a result of adding and expanding the various distribution channels through which we sell our products our network is well balanced with no customer providing more than 6 of our sales in 2013 

our overall dealer network which is located principally in the united states canada and latin america is the industrys largest network of factory direct independent generator contractors in addition the acquisition of tower light in august 2013 provides access to numerous independent distributors in over 50 countries 

our residentialcommercial dealer network sells installs and services our residential and lightcommercial products to end users we have increased our level of investment in recent years by focusing on a variety of initiatives to more effectively market and sell our home standby products and better align our dealer network with generac 

our industrial dealer network provides industrial and commercial end users with ongoing sales and product support our industrial dealers maintain the local relationships with commercial electrical contractors specifying engineers and national account regional buying offices in recent years we have been particularly focused on expanding our dealer network in latin america and other regions of the world in order to expand our international sales opportunities 

our retail distribution network includes thousands of locations and includes regional and national home improvement chains retailers clubs buying groups and farm supply stores these physical retail locations are supplemented by a number of catalogue and ecommerce retailers this network primarily sells our residential standby portable and lightcommercial generators as well as our power washers 

our wholesaler network distributes our residential and lightcommercial generators and consists of selling branches of both national and local distribution houses for electrical and hvac products 

on a selective basis we have established private label and licensing arrangements with third party partners to provide residential lightcommercial and industrial generators these partners include leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies each of which provides access to incremental channels of distribution for our products 

the distribution for our mobile products includes international national and regional equipment rental companies equipment dealers and construction companies which primarily serve nonresidential building construction road construction and energy markets 

we sell direct to certain national account customers that are the end users of our products covering a number of end market verticals including telecommunication retail banking convenience stores and other light commercial applications 

additionally we sell certain engines directly to oem manufacturers and aftermarket dealers for use in the lawn garden and rental markets 

business strategy 

we believe our growth over the last several years is due in part to the development and execution of our powering ahead” strategy since shortly after our initial public offering in 2010 this strategic plan has served as the framework for the significant investments we have made to drive the growth of generac as we continue to move the powering ahead plan into the future we are focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the same four key objectives 

 

  

  

growing the residential standby generator market as the leader in the home standby generator category it is incumbent upon us to continue to drive growth and increase the penetration rate of these products in households across the united states central to this strategy is to increase the awareness availability and affordability of home standby generators ongoing power outage activity combined with expanding our dealer base and overall distribution in affected regions are key drivers in elevating the awareness of home standby generators over the long term we intend to continue to supplement these key growth drivers with targeted sales and marketing initiatives to further extend the awareness of home standby generators in addition we intend to continue to focus on innovation in this emerging product category and introduce new products into the marketplace with only approximately 30 penetration of the addressable market of us homes which we define as singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2011 american housing survey for the united states we believe there are opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market 

gaining commercial and industrial market share our growth strategy for commercial and industrial power generation products is focused on incremental market share gains key to this objective are our efforts to develop and improve our industrial distribution increase our addressable market with new products and increase the rate at which our products are specified in ci power generation applications in addition we will attempt to garner incremental market share through our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning more cost effective natural gas fueled backup power solutions while still a much smaller portion of the overall ci market we believe demand for these products continues to increase at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators as a result of their lower capital and operating costs we also believe there is an opportunity to provide smaller more cost effective generators marketed aggressively towards the underpenetrated “optional” standby market which includes smaller footprint commercial buildings with our scale in these smaller commercial products our distribution capabilities and our national account customer focus we believe we have an opportunity to penetrate these markets by using a targeted marketing approach and funneling opportunities to our distribution partners 

diversifying end markets by expanding product offerings and services in recent years we have worked hard to diversify generacs end markets with new products and services much of this diversification has been achieved with our strategic acquisitions over the last three years we now have access to several new products new markets and new customers through the purchase of the magnum products business in october 2011 the ottomotores businesses in december 2012 tower light in august 2013 and baldor generators in november 2013 as a result of these acquisitions we now have access to a broad lineup of mobile power products as well as products that serve the oil  gas and other infrastructure power markets additionally our reentry into the market for power washers in 2011 provides us with an opportunity to further diversify our company with the addition of this platform as we continue to build upon our recent diversification efforts we intend to evaluate other products and services which we believe could further diversify our end markets 

expanding into new geographies during 2013 approximately 8 of our revenues were shipped to regions outside the us and canada given that the global market for power generation equipment is estimated to exceed 15 billion annually we believe there are growth opportunities for generac by expanding into new geographies prior to 2013 these efforts had been mostly organic with the creation of a dedicated sales team and the addition of over 100 new distribution points around the globe with many of those in latin america the acquisitions of the ottomotores and tower light businesses provide us with an enhanced platform and immediate scale for our international growth initiatives and accelerates our efforts to become a more global player in the markets for backup power and mobile power equipment as we look forward we intend to leverage these recent acquisitions while also evaluating other opportunities to expand into other regions of the world 

we believe the investments we have made to date due in part to our powering ahead strategy have helped to capitalize on the macro secular growth drivers for our business and are an important part of our efforts to diversify and globalize our business see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – business drivers and trends” for additional drivers that influence demand for our products and other trends affecting the markets that we serve 

manufacturing 

we operate several manufacturing plants located principally in wisconsin usa mexico italy and brazil totaling over three million square feet we also maintain inventory warehouses in the united states that accommodate material storage and rapid response requirements of our customers 

in recent years we have added manufacturing capacity through investments in automation improved utilization and the expansion of our manufacturing footprint through organic means as well as through acquisitions we believe we have sufficient capacity to achieve our business goals for the neartointermediate term 

research and development 

our primary focus on generators and engine powered equipment drives technological innovation specialized engineering and manufacturing competencies research and development is a core competency and includes a staff of over 250 engineers working on numerous active projects our sponsored research and development expense was 293 million 235 million and 165 million for the years ended december 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively research and development is conducted at each of our manufacturing facilities and additionally at our technical center in suzhou china with dedicated teams for each product line research and development is focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements as well as maintaining product competitiveness by improving manufacturing costs safety characteristics reliability and performance while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards we have over 30 years of experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology in the residential and light commercial markets we have developed proprietary engines cooling packages controls fuel systems and emissions systems we believe that our expertise in engine powered equipment gives us the capability to develop new products that will allow continued diversification in our end markets 

  

  

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights our commitment to research and development has resulted in a portfolio of over 100 us and international patents and patent applications our patents expire between 2016 and 2030 and protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems air flow electronics and controls noise reduction and aircooled engines new us patents that are issued generally have a life of 20 years from the date the patent application is initially filed us and international trademark registrations generally have a perpetual duration if they are properly maintained and renewed we believe the existence of these patents and trademarks along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position we also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment 

suppliers of raw materials 

our primary raw material inputs are steel copper and aluminum all of which are purchased from third parties and in many cases as part of machined or manufactured components we have developed an extensive network of reliable lowcost suppliers in the united states and abroad our strategic global sourcing function continuously evaluates the cost structure of our products and assesses the capabilities of our supply chain components are sourced accordingly based on this evaluation our supplier quality engineers conduct onsite audits of major supply chain partners and help to maintain the reliability of critical sourced components in 2013 we sourced approximately 60 of our materials and components from outside the united states 

competition 

the market for power generation equipment is competitive we face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers abroad however most of the traditional participants in the generator market compete on a more specialized basis focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix we are the only significant market participant focused predominantly on standby portable and mobile generators with broad capabilities across the residential light commercial industrial and construction generator markets we believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a firstmover advantage over our competition for product innovation we also believe our broad product offering and diverse distribution model provide for additional advantages as well 

a summary of the primary competitors across our main product classes are as follows 

residential standby generators – kohler briggs  stratton and cummins onan division each of which also have broad operations in other manufacturing businesses 

portable generators – honda briggs  stratton pramac and techtronics international tti along with a number of smaller domestic and foreign competitors 

power washers – briggs  stratton tti fna group mitm and karcher 

standby commercial and industrial generators – caterpillar cummins kohler mtu most of which focus on the market for diesel generators as they are also diesel engine manufacturers 

mobile generators – doosan wacker and multiquip 

light towers – terex allmand wacker and atlas copco 

there are a number of other standby generator manufacturers and packagers located outside north america but most supply their products mainly to their respective regional markets in a continuously evolving sector we believe our scale and broad capabilities make us well positioned to remain competitive 

we compete primarily on the basis of brand reputation quality reliability pricing innovative features breadth of product offering and product availability 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we had 3380 employees 3032 full time and 348 parttime and temporary employees of those 2094 employees were directly involved in manufacturing at our manufacturing facilities 

domestically we have had an “open shop” bargaining agreement for the past 48 years the current agreement which expires october 17 2016 covers our waukesha and eagle wisconsin facilities additionally our plants in mexico italy and brazil are operated under various local or national union groups our other facilities are not unionized

 item 1a risk factors 

 

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report 

 

risk factors related to our business and industry 

 

demand for our products is significantly affected by unpredictable major poweroutage events that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts and other grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory the lack of major poweroutage events can affect our net sales in the years following a given storm season unpredictable fluctuations in demand are therefore part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe major power outages create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products 

 

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets 

 

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 

 

  

  

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies and have substantially greater financial resources some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for more information see “item 1—business—competition” 

 

our industry is subject to technological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures their introduction may be delayed they may have higher production costs than originally expected or they may not be accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label telecommunications retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large telecommunications retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors and customers with whom we do business offer products and services of our competitors impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 

 

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we view our intellectual property rights as very important assets we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to get a conclusion and we may not prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements furthermore in connection with our sale of generac portable products to a private equity firm in 1998 we granted the private equity firm an exclusive perpetual license for the use of the “generac portable products” trademark in connection with the manufacture and sale of certain engine driven consumer products this perpetual license was eventually transferred to another company when the private equity firm sold that business currently this trademark is not being used in commerce and as such there is a rebuttable presumption that the trademark has been abandoned however in the event that this trademark is used in the future we could suffer competitive confusion and our business could be negatively impacted 

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

 

  

  

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions and noise including standards imposed by the federal environmental protection agency “epa” state regulatory agencies such as california air resources board “carb” and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example  we were required to modify our sparkignited aircooled gaseous engines to comply with the 2011 epa and carb regulations as well as the continued implementation of tier 4 nonroad diesel engine changes associated with acquisitions serving the mobile product markets typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 

 

we may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability 

 

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

 

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the majority of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 

 

  

  

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

  

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

 

we singlesourced certain types of parts in our product designs during 2013 any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit weather events or natural disasters 

 

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries including but not limited to mexico italy and brazil we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries including but not limited to mexico italy and brazil we are subject to the regulations imposed by a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act or the ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

 

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired in the future net income could be materially adversely affected 

 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names at december 31 2013 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 8911 million most of which arose from the ccmp transaction we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of operations a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 35020 goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment and definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances the amount of any impairment is recorded as a charge to the statement of operations we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of intangible assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for details 

 

  

  

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit our ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies on may 31 2013 we amended and restated our term loan credit agreement pursuant to which we incurred 1200 million of a senior secured term loan to replace our prior 900 million term loan facility following the refinancing we used the available proceeds from the new term loan and cash on hand to fund a special cash dividend to our stockholders of 500 per share and to pay related financing fees and expenses in the future if we are unable to refinance such facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected 

 

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the combination of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

in addition the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline 

 

the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

 

risks related to our common stock 

 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material 

 

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

 

while we declared a special dividend in both june 2012 and june 2013 we do not anticipate paying any further dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock we intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of outstanding debt in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future while we may change this policy at some point in the future we cannot assure that we will make such a change 

 

risks related to our capital structure 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2013 we had total indebtedness of 11878 million our significant level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our significant indebtedness combined with our lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences for example it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of the abovelisted factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate once above a certain libor floor if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 

 

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

  

our credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests these restrictions include among other things our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “item 6  selected financial data” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those set forth under “item 1a  risk factors” 

overview 

we are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of power generation equipment and other engine powered products serving the residential light commercial industrial and construction markets unlike our primary competitors in the generator market power generation is our main focus as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the power equipment market in north america and an expanding presence internationally we believe we have one of the widest range of products in the marketplace including residential commercial and industrial standby generators as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications other engine powered products that we design and manufacture include light towers which provide temporary lighting for various end markets and a broad product line of power washers for residential and commercial use 

business drivers and operational factors 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of business drivers and trends as well as operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 

business drivers and trends 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power solutions by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important drivers and trends affecting our industry including the following 

increasing penetration opportunity many potential customers are not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for home standby generators are only approximately 30 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2011 american housing survey for the united states the decision to purchase backup power for many lightcommercial buildings such as convenience stores restaurants and gas stations are more returnoninvestment roi driven and as a result these applications have relatively lower penetration rates as compared to buildings used in more codedriven or mission critical applications such as hospitals wastewater treatment facilities 911 call centers data centers and certain industrial locations in addition the emergence of lower cost cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators has helped to accelerate the penetration of standby generators in the lightcommercial market also the importance of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure is increasing due to the growing importance for uninterrupted voice and data services we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators 

effect of large scale power disruptions power disruptions are an important driver of customer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators increased frequency and duration of major power outage events caused by the aging us power grid increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months for standby generators for example the multiple major outage events that occurred during the second half of both 2011 and 2012 drove strong demand for portable and home standby generators and the increased awareness of these products contributed to substantial organic revenue growth in 2012 with strong growth continuing during 2013 while there are localized power outages that occur practically every day across the us major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period 

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators is also affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income the value of their home and overall net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators trends in the new housing market highlighted by residential housing starts can also impact demand for our residential products 

impact of business capital investment cycle the market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by the overall capital investment cycle including nonresidential building construction durable goods and infrastructure spending as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil  gas as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial retail telecommunications industrial data centers healthcare construction oil  gas and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic conditions and credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve in addition we believe demand for our mobile power products will continue to benefit from a secular shift towards renting versus buying this type of equipment 

factors affecting results of operations 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing and cost control certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum and other components we use in our products together with foreign currency fluctuations can have a material impact on our results of operations we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of rising commodity currency and component prices through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are borne by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 

 

  

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past three years approximately 16 to 27 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 20 to 23 in the second quarter 24 to 30 in the third quarter and 25 to 34 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the presence timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period for example there were multiple major power outage events that occurred during the second half of both 2011 and 2012 which were significant in terms of severity as a result the seasonality experienced during this time period varied relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred we maintain a flexible production and supply chain infrastructure in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand but assuming no major outage events typically increase production levels in the second and third quarters of each year 

factors influencing interest expense interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements and repayments of indebtedness interest expense increased during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt and the fullyear weightedaverage cost of debt associated with our credit agreement refinancings see note 6 – credit agreements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional details 

factors influencing provision for income taxes and cash income taxes paid we had approximately 960 million of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december 31 2013 related to our acquisition by ccmp in 2006 that we expect to generate cash tax savings of approximately 374 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the recognition of the tax benefit associated with these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 48 million through 2020 and 40 million in 2021 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate as a result of the asset acquisition of the magnum products business in the fourth quarter of 2011 we had approximately 483 million of incremental tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets remaining as of december 31 2013 we expect these assets to generate cash tax savings of 189 million through 2026 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 38 million annually through 2025 and 28 million in 2026 which generates an additional annual cash tax savings of 15 million through 2025 and 11 million in 2026 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2026 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes other domestic acquisitions have resulted in additional tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets that will generate tax savings but are not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in the second quarter of 2013 the dividend recapitalization discussed under “liquidity and financial position” was completed after considering the increased debt and related interest expense the company believes it will still generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax attributes discussed above 

transactions with ccmp 

in november 2006 affiliates of ccmp together with certain other investors and members of our management purchased an aggregate of 689 million of our equity capital in addition on november 10 2006 generac power systems borrowed an aggregate of 138 billion consisting of an initial drawdown of 950 million under a 11 billion first lien secured credit facility and 430 million under a 430 million second lien secured credit facility with the proceeds from these equity and debt financings together with cash on hand at generac power systems we 1 acquired all of the capital stock of generac power systems and repaid certain pretransaction indebtedness of generac power systems for 20 billion 2 paid 66 million in transaction costs related to the transaction and 3 retained 3 million for general corporate purposes subsequently during 2007 2008 and 2009 affiliates of ccmp acquired approximately 2492 million of second lien term loans and 99 million of first lien term loans for approximately 1559 million ccmp’s affiliates then exchanged this debt for additional shares of thenexisting class b common stock and series a preferred stock which were subsequently converted into the same class of our common stock through a corporate reorganization in conjunction with the initial public offering in february 2010 

in august 2013 ccmp completed the last of a series of sale transactions that began in november 2012 by which it sold substantially all of the shares of common stock that it owned as of the initial public offering 

initial public offering 

on february 17 2010 the company completed its initial public offering of 18750000 shares of its common stock at a price of 1300 per share in addition the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 1950500 shares of the company’s common stock from the company on march 18 2010 we received a total of approximately 2479 million in net proceeds from the initial public offering and underwriters’ option exercise after deducting the underwriting discounts and expenses all shares sold in this offering were primary shares immediately following the ipo and underwriters’ option exercise we had 67529290 total shares of common stock outstanding

substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our generators and other engine powered products for the residential light commercial industrial and construction markets we also sell engines to certain customers and service parts to our dealer network net sales which include shipping and handling charges billed to customers are recognized upon shipment of products to our customers related freight costs are included in cost of sales our generators and other products are fueled by natural gas liquid propane gasoline diesel or bifuel™ systems with power output from 800w to several megawatts mw using our multigenerator systems our products are primarily manufactured and assembled at our wisconsin usa mexico italy and brazil facilities and distributed through thousands of outlets primarily across the us and canada with an expanding presence internationally including latin america europe the middle east africa and asiapacific regions our smaller kw generators for the residential and commercial markets as well as light towers and power washers are primarily built to stock while our larger kw products for the industrial markets are generally customized and built to order 

during 2013 our net sales were affected primarily by the us economy as sales outside of the united states represented approximately 12 of total net sales 

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 6 of our sales for the year ended december 31 2013 and our top ten customers representing less than 24 of our sales for the same period 

  

  

costs of goods sold 

the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised over 85 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2013 the principal component parts are engines and alternators we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our products up to 20kw we source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our products larger than 20kw for natural gas engines we’re recognized as the oem of those engines we design all the alternators for our units and manufacture alternators for certain of our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable high quality suppliers in some cases these relationships are proprietary 

the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing and warehousing processes and in the manufacturing of the components we source are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions however there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies support and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our sales marketing distribution service parts engineering information systems human resources finance risk management legal and tax functions all of these categories include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs and taxes we typically classify our operating expenses into four categories selling and service research and development general and administrative and amortization of intangibles

other indefinitelived intangible assets consist of trade names the fair value of trade names is measured using a relieffromroyalty approach which assumes the fair value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had we not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a noncash charge which primarily related to the write down of a certain trade name we refer you to note 2significant accounting policiesgoodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information about this charge

operating expenses operating expenses increased 13 million to 2181 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from 2168 million for the year ended december 31 2012 operating expenses increased as a result of the addition of the ottomotores tower light and baldor generator businesses as well as increased sales engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher sales levels of the company these increases were mostly offset by warranty rate improvements resulting in a 176 million favorable adjustment to warranty reserves driven by better claims experience which impacted selling and service expense as well as a decline in the amortization of intangibles 

 

  

  

other expense other expense increased 55 million or 83 to 727 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from 672 million for the year ended december 31 2012 these additional expenses were primarily driven by an increase in interest expense over prior year interest expense increased by 53 million or 108 over the prior year due to the higher debt levels from the may 2012 and 2013 refinancing transactions partially offset by a slight reduction in interest rate on the new credit facility 

income tax expense income tax expense increased 411 million to 1042 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from 631 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in income tax expense was primarily driven by the increase in pretax income during 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by a lower effective tax rate the decrease in the effective income tax rate yearoveryear is primarily due to the lower tax rate of a foreign subsidiary acquired during the fourth quarter of 2012 and the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in 2013

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company including information about contingencies risk and financial condition the company believes given current facts and circumstances that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to accounting principles generally accepted in the us and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property plant and equipment and prepaid expenses management believes the company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment business combinations and purchase accounting defined benefit pension obligations estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty other contingencies derivative accounting income taxes and share based compensation 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired from business acquisitions goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of impairment are present the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually on october 1 or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable the company has the option to assess goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then further goodwill impairment testing is not required to be performed if the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company is required to perform a twostep goodwill impairment test in the first step the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its book value the related goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is necessary if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step is performed when required the second step of testing involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of its net assets and identifiable intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for reporting units with a negative book value ie excess of liabilities over assets qualitative factors are evaluated to determine whether it is necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 

 

the company performed the required annual impairment tests for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 and found no impairment of goodwill 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consist of trade names the company tests the carrying value of these trade names by comparing the assets fair value to its carrying value fair value was measured using a relieffromroyalty approach which assumes the fair value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had the company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company the company conducts its annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets on october 31 st of each year 

 

the company performed the required annual impairment tests for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 and found no impairment of indefinitelived trade names during the fourth quarter of 2011 the company decided to strategically transition certain products to their more widely known generac brand based on this decision the company recorded a 94 million noncash trade name impairment charge as of october 31 2011 which primarily related to the write down of the impacted trade name to net realizable value 

 

we can make no assurances that remaining goodwill or indefinitelived trade names will not be impaired in the future when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year additionally since our measurement also considers a market approach changes in comparable public company multiples can also materially impact our impairment analysis 

in the long term our remaining goodwill and indefinitelived trade name balances could be further impaired in future periods a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue operating costs and other relevant factors if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our business may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

  

  

business combinations and purchase accounting 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values and the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions while the ultimate responsibility resides with management for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities including intangible assets and tangible longlived assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions the most significant being projected revenue growth rates earnings margins and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate 

defined benefit pension obligations 

the funded status of our pension plans is more fully described in note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the company’s pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2013 used a discount rate of 498 for the salaried pension plan and 501 for the hourly pension plan our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of “aa” or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service no compensation increase is assumed in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation as the plans were frozen effective december 31 2008 

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations given this policy we expect to make 21 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2014 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty reserves and other contingencies 

the reserves if any for customer rebates product warranty product liability litigation excess and obsolete inventory and doubtful accounts are factspecific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations historical experience and current and expected economic conditions these reserves are reflected under notes 2 4 5 and 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

derivative accounting 

we enter into interest rate swap contracts or swaps to fix a portion of our variable rate indebtedness due to the incorporation of a new interest rate floor provision in the term loan credit agreement which constituted a change in critical terms the company concluded that as of may 30 2012 the swaps outstanding at that time would no longer be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows during the periods the hedges are designated as a result the company was required to dedesignate the hedges as of may 30 2012 beginning may 31 2012 the effective portion of the swaps prior to the change ie amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss were amortized into interest expense over the period of the originally designated hedged transactions which had various dates through october 2013 subsequent changes in fair value of the related swaps were immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as interest expense 

as required by asc 815 derivatives and hedging we record the swaps at fair value pursuant to asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value when determining the fair value of the swaps we considered our credit risk in accordance with asc 820 the fair value of our outstanding swaps including the impact of credit risk at december 31 2013 and 2012 was an asset of 12 million and a liability of 30 million respectively 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 

we have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment as of september 30 2011 we were in a three year cumulative loss position and had a full valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2011 we came out of a threeyear cumulative loss position and as part of the normal assessment of the future realization of our net deferred tax assets determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required as a result the valuation allowance previously recorded was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and was recorded as a component of the income tax provision 

  

  

ottomotores brazil acquired in the ottomotores acquisition in december 2012 is in a threeyear cumulative net loss position and therefore we have not considered expected future taxable income in analyzing the realizability of their deferred tax assets as of december 31 2013 as a result a full valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets of ottomotores brazil 

in performing the assessment of the realization of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2013 excluding ottomotores brazil we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance is required 

share based compensation 

under the fair value recognition provisions of asc 718 compensation – stock compensation  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends and market volatility of our stock in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates to reduce the risk from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we use financial instruments from time to time we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign currency 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of purchasing from suppliers in other countries as well as operating businesses in foreign countries periodically we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases in the normal course of business contracts typically have maturities of one year or less realized and unrealized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold at december 31 2012 we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31 2013 we had the following foreign currency contracts outstanding in thousands 

 

with the purchase of the ottomotores businesses in december 2012 and the tower light business in august 2013 a small portion of revenues and expenses are now denominated in euros mexican pesos brazilian real and british pounds 

commodity prices 

we are a purchaser of commodities and of components manufactured from commodities including steel aluminum copper and others as a result we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process depending on the supplier these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies or supply chain savings to offset increases in commodity costs 

periodically we engage in certain commodity risk management activities the primary objectives of these activities are to understand and mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results generally these risk management transactions will involve the use of commodity derivatives to protect against exposure resulting from significant price fluctuations 

we primarily utilize commodity contracts with maturities of one year or less these are intended to offset the effect of price fluctuations on actual inventory purchases the primary objective of the hedge is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of commodity on our financial results as of december 31 2013 we had the following commodity forward contracts outstanding in thousands

our primary focus on generators and engine powered equipment drives technological innovation specialized engineering and manufacturing competencies research and development is a core competency and includes a staff of over 200 engineers working on numerous active projects our sponsored research and development expense was 235 million 165 million and 147 million for the years ended december 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   research and development is conducted at each of our manufacturing facilities and additionally at our technical center in suzhou china with dedicated teams for each product line research and development is focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements as well as maintaining product competitiveness by improving manufacturing costs safety characteristics reliability and performance while ensuring compliance with governmental standards we have had over 30 years of experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology in the residential and light commercial markets we have developed proprietary engines cooling packages controls fuel systems and emissions systems we believe that our expertise in engine powered equipment gives us the capability to develop new products that will allow continued diversification in our end markets 

we rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights our commitment to research and development has resulted in a portfolio of approximately 90 us and international patents and patent applications our patents expire between 2016 and 2031 and protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems air flow electronics and controls noise reduction and aircooled engines us trademark registrations generally have a perpetual duration if they are properly maintained and renewed new us patents that are issued generally have a life of 20 years from the date the patent application is initially filed we believe the existence of these patents and trademarks along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position we also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment 

suppliers of raw materials 

our primary raw material inputs are steel copper and aluminum all of which are purchased from third parties and in many cases as part of machined or manufactured components we have developed an extensive network of reliable lowcost suppliers in the united states and abroad our strategic global sourcing function continuously evaluates the cost structure of our products and capabilities of our supply chain and sources components accordingly based on this evaluation in 2012 we sourced approximately half of our components from outside the united states 

competition 

the market for onsite standby generators is competitive we face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers abroad however most of the traditional participants in the standby generator market compete on a more specialized basis focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix we are the only significant market participant focused predominantly on standby and portable generators with broad capabilities across the residential industrial and lightcommercial generator markets we believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a firstmover advantage over our competition for product innovation we also believe our broad product offering and diverse distribution model provide for additional advantages as well 

in the market for standby commercial and industrial generators our primary competitors are caterpillar cummins kohler and mtu most of which focus on the market for diesel generators as they are also diesel engine manufacturers in the market for residential standby generators our primary competitors include briggs  stratton cummins onan division and kohler which also have broad operations in other manufacturing businesses in the portable generator market our primary competitors include briggs  stratton honda and techtronics international tti along with a number of smaller domestic and foreign competitors in the market for mobile generators our primary competitors are doosanir multi quip caterpiller and wacker our competitors in the market for light towers include terex allmand and wacker 

there are a number of other standby generator manufacturers located outside north america but most supply their products mainly to their respective regional markets in a continuously evolving sector we believe our size and broad capabilities make us well positioned to remain competitive 

we compete primarily on the basis of brand reputation quality reliability pricing innovative features breadth of product and product availability 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had 3048 employees 2700 full time and 348 parttime and temporary employees of those 1935 employees were directly involved in manufacturing at our manufacturing facilities 

we have had an “open shop” bargaining agreement for the past 47 years our current agreement is with the communication workers of america local 4603 the current agreement which expires october 17 2016 covers our waukesha and eagle facilities currently less than 1 of our workforce is a member of a labor union our facilities in whitewater wisconsin jefferson wisconsin and berlin wisconsin are not unionized 

  

  

regulation including environmental matters 

as a manufacturing company our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition our products are subject to various laws and regulations relating to among other things emissions and fuel requirements as well as labeling and marketing 

our products are regulated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” california air resources board “carb” and various other state and local air quality management districts these governing bodies continue to pass regulations that require us to meet more stringent emission standards and all of our engines and enginedriven products are regulated within the united states and its territories other countries have various degrees of regulation depending upon product application and fuel types new regulations could require us to redesign our products and could affect market growth for our products

 item 1a risk factors 

 

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report 

 

risk factors related to our business and industry 

 

demand for our products is significantly affected by unpredictable major poweroutage events that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts and other grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory the lack of major poweroutage events can affect our net sales in the years following a given storm season unpredictable fluctuations in demand are therefore part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe major power outages create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products 

 

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets 

 

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 

 

  

  

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies and have substantially greater financial resources some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for more information see “item 1—business—competition” 

 

our industry is subject to technological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

 

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures their introduction may be delayed they may have higher production costs than originally expected or they may not be accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label telecommunications retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large telecommunications retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors and customers with whom we do business offer products and services of our competitors impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 

 

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we view our intellectual property rights as very important assets we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business not only are intellectual propertyrelated proceedings burdensome and costly but they could span years to get a conclusion and we may not prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements furthermore in connection with our sale of generac portable products to the beacon group in 1998 we granted the beacon group an exclusive perpetual license for the use of the “generac portable products” trademark in connection with the manufacture and sale of certain engine driven consumer products this perpetual license was eventually transferred to briggs and stratton briggs when the beacon group sold that business to briggs currently this trademark is not being used in commerce and as such there is a rebuttable presumption that briggs has abandoned the trademark however in the event that the beacon group or briggs use this trademark in the future we could suffer competitive confusion and our business could be negatively impacted 

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

 

  

  

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions and noise including standards imposed by the federal environmental protection agency “epa” state regulatory agencies such as california air resources board “carb” and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our projects or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example  we were required to modify our sparkignited aircooled gaseous engines to comply with the 2011 epa and carb regulations as well as the continued implementation of tier 4 nonroad diesel engine changes associated with the magnum acquisition typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 

 

we may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability 

 

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

 

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the majority of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our facilities in particular our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 

 

  

  

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we are vulnerable to supply disruptions from singlesourced suppliers 

 

we singlesourced certain types of parts in our product designs during 2012 any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers a wide variety of factors could cause such delays including but not limited to lack of capacity economic downturns availability of credit weather events or natural disasters 

 

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries including but not limited to mexico and brazil we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide a determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

as a us corporation that conducts business in a variety of foreign countries including but not limited to mexico and brazil we are subject to the regulations imposed by a variety of anticorruption laws worldwide the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business the united kingdom bribery act or the ukba prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials any determination that we have violated any anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

 

we have significant tax assets usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future 

 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 541 million of net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section 382 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 including through sales of stock by large stockholders all of which are outside of our control could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities however we believe any limitation would not be material 

 

  

 

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired in the future net income could be materially adversely affected 

 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names at december 31 2012 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 7118 million most of which arose from the ccmp transactions we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of operations a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles such as the 94 million noncash charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily related to the write down of a certain trade name as we strategically transition to the generac brand could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 35020 goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment and definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances the amount of any impairment is recorded as a charge to the statement of operations we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of intangible assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for details 

 

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit our ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies on may 30 2012 the company completed a refinancing of its senior secured credit facilities pursuant to which it has incurred 900 million of senior secured term loans to replace its prior 575 million term loan facilities following the refinancing the company used the available proceeds from the new term loans and cash on hand to fund a special cash dividend to its stockholders of 600 per share and to pay related financing fees and expenses in the future if we are unable to refinance such facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected 

 

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales 

 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of the ottomotores business or other acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses 

 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the ottomotores acquisition which was consummated on december 8 2012 or other acquisitions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process further integrating and managing businesses with international operations such as the ottomotores business may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

in addition the overall integration of the ottomotores business or other acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline 

 

  

  

the difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include among others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of ottomotores or other acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of ottomotores or other acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

 

  

  

risks related to our common stock 

 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material 

 

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

 

while we declared a special dividend in june 2012 we do not anticipate paying any further dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock we intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of outstanding debt in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future while we may change this policy at some point in the future we cannot assure that we will make such a change 

 

  

  

risks related to our capital structure 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2012 we had total indebtedness of 8813 million our significant level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our significant indebtedness combined with our lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences for example it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of the abovelisted factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate once above a certain libor floor if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 

 

the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

 

our credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests these restrictions include among other things our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants 

 

  

  

our principal stockholder continues to have substantial control over us 

 

affiliates of ccmp collectively beneficially own approximately 344 of our outstanding common stock prior to sales of a portion of their holdings in us in february 2013 and november 2012 affiliates of ccmp owned approximately 586 of our outstanding common stock notwithstanding this reduction ccmp or its affiliates remain able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and will exert a significant degree of influence in matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors a merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant transaction the interests of this stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders for instance this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price 

 

conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our principal stockholder 

 

representatives of ccmp and its affiliates currently occupy two of eight seats on our board of directors ccmp or its affiliates could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us or companies in which ccmp or its affiliates are currently invested may already compete with us as a result of these relationships when conflicts arise between the interests of ccmp or its affiliates and the interests of our stockholders these directors may not be disinterested the representatives of ccmp and its affiliates on our board of directors by the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “item 6  selected financial data” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those set forth under “item 1a  risk factors” 

overview 

we are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of generators and other engine powered products for the residential light commercial industrial and construction markets as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the power equipment market in the united states canada and mexico we design manufacture source and modify engines alternators transfer switches and other components necessary for our products our products are fueled by natural gas liquid propane gasoline diesel and bifuel™ and are available through a broad network of independent dealers retailers wholesalers and equipment rental companies 

business drivers and measures 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of industry trends performance measures and operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 

industry trends 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power solutions by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important trends affecting our industry including the following 

increasing penetration opportunity many potential customers are not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for residential products are approximately 25 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2009 american housing survey for the united states and penetration rates of many lightcommercial outlets such as restaurants drug stores and gas stations are significantly lower than penetration of hospitals and industrial locations we believe by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators 

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators is affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income or net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have a material impact on demand for residential generators trends in the new housing market can also impact demand for our residential products 

  

  

  

effect of large scale power disruptions power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators increased frequency and duration of major power outage events caused by the aging us power grid increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months for standby generators for example multiple major outage events that occurred over the last six quarters drove strong demand for portable and home standby generators and the increased awareness of these products contributed to substantial revenue growth for us in 2012 as a result of recent major power outage activity in late octoberearly november 2012 affecting the east coast we have seen increased demand for our home standby and portable generators while the full impact is uncertain we expect near term results of operations to be positively impacted by this outage activity while there are power outages every day across all regions of the country major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period 

impact of business capital investment cycle the market for commercial and industrial stationary and mobile generators and other power equipment is affected by the capital investment cycle and overall nonresidential construction and durable goods spending as businesses either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various industrial and commercial end markets that we serve industrial telecommunications distribution retail health care facilities construction energy and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic conditions and credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve 

operational factors 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing and cost control certain operational factors that affect our business include the following 

new product startup costs when we launch new products we generally experience an increase in startup costs including engineering expenses expediting costs testing expenses marketing expenses and warranty costs resulting in lower gross margins after the initial launch of a new product margins on new product introductions generally increase over the life of the product as these startup costs decline and we focus our engineering efforts on product cost reduction 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum and other components we use in our products together with foreign currency fluctuations can have a material impact on our results of operations we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of rising commodity currency and component prices through improved product design and sourcing manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are borne by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 

other factors 

other factors that affect our results of operations include the following 

factors influencing interest expense interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements and repayments of indebtedness interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a slight increase in the weightedaverage cost of debt associated with the credit agreement see footnote 6 – credit agreement for the period between february 9 2012 and may 29 2012 as well as an increase in outstanding debt and the weightedaverage cost of debt associated with the term loan credit agreement defined below for the period between may 30 2012 and december 31 2012 

factors influencing provision for income taxes because we made a section 338h10 election in connection with the ccmp transactions we have 11 billion of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december 31 2012 that we expect to generate cash tax savings of 422 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate   the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 48 million through 2020 and 40 million in 2021 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate additionally we have federal net operating loss or nol carryforwards of 541 million as of december 31 2012 which we expect to generate an additional 189 million of federal cash tax savings at a 35 rate when and if utilized   based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2021 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes however any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section 382 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 including through sales of stock by large stockholders all of which are outside of our control could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities we believe any limitations would not be material 

in addition as a result of the asset acquisition of magnum we have approximately 520 million of tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets remaining as of december 31 2012 we expect these assets to generate tax savings of 203 million through 2026 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 38 million annually through 2025 and 28 million in 2026 which generates an additional annual cash tax savings of 15 million through 2025 and 11 million in 2026 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past three years approximately 16 to 25 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 20 to 24 in the second quarter 26 to 30 in the third quarter and 27 to 34 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the timing of major power outage activity in each year such as the outage activity experienced in the third and fourth quarters of both 2011 and 2012 due to the significant demand and awareness created by the outage events in the second half of 2012 our historical seasonality patterns may not apply in 2013 

we maintain a flexible production and supply chain schedule in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand but typically increase production levels in the second and third quarters of each year 

 

  

  

transactions with ccmp 

in november 2006 affiliates of ccmp together with certain other investors and members of our management purchased an aggregate of 689 million of our equity capital in addition on november 10 2006 generac power systems borrowed an aggregate of 138 billion consisting of an initial drawdown of 950 million under a 11 billion first lien secured credit facility and 430 million under a 430 million second lien secured credit facility with the proceeds from these equity and debt financings together with cash on hand at generac power systems we 1 acquired all of the capital stock of generac power systems and repaid certain pretransaction indebtedness of generac power systems for 20 billion 2 paid 66 million in transaction costs related to the transaction and 3 retained 3 million for general corporate purposes 

 

during 2007 2008 and 2009 affiliates of ccmp acquired approximately 2492 million of second lien term loans and 99 million of first lien term loans for approximately 1559 million ccmp’s affiliates exchanged this debt for additional shares of class b common stock and series a preferred stock we recorded these transactions as additional class b common stock and series a preferred stock based on the fair value of the debt contributed by ccmp’s affiliates which approximated the fair value of the shares exchanged in connection with such issuances of our class b common stock and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the stockholders’ agreement that arose from such issuances affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of our class b common stock to an entity affiliated with ccmp certain other investors and certain members of our management and board of directors in addition in connection with such issuances of our series a preferred stock and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the stockholders agreement that arose from such issuances during 2009 we issued 2000 shares of series a preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of 200 million in cash to an entity affiliated with ccmp and certain members of management and our board of directors and affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of series a preferred stock they were issued to an entity affiliated with ccmp and a member of the board of directors at the same price 

corporate reorganization 

our capitalization prior to the initial public offering consisted of series a preferred stock class b common stock and class a common stock our series a preferred stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a 14 annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares and equity participation equal to 243 of the remaining equity value of the company our class b common stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a 10 annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares in connection with the initial public offering we undertook a corporate reorganization which gave effect to the conversion of our series a preferred stock and class b common stock into the same class of our common stock that was sold in our initial public offering while taking into account the rights and preference of those shares including the priority returns of our series a preferred stock and our class b common stock and the equity participation rights of the series a preferred stock a reverse stock split was needed to reduce the number of shares to be issued to holders of our class a and class b common stock to the number that correctly reflected the proportionate interest of such stockholders in our company taking into account the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon the conversion of our series a preferred stock and the number and value of shares of common stock to be issued and sold to new investors in the initial public offering we refer to these transactions as the “corporate reorganization” the specific steps in the corporate reorganization were as follows 

treatment of class b common stock 

our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering provided for the mandatory conversion of our class b voting common stock to class a common stock in the event of an initial public offering so that our class b common stock is converted into the same class of our common stock that is to be offered in an initial public offering taking into account of the value rights and preferences of our class b common stock in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering at the time we entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the initial public offering each share of our class b common stock automatically converted into a number of shares of our class a common stock equal to one plus the quotient obtained by dividing ix the amount paid for such share of class b common stock plus y an increase to such amount equal to 10 per annum calculated and compounded quarterly on the basis of a 360day year of twelve 30day months and which increased amount shall be deemed to have accrued on a daily basis by ii the public offering price net of underwriting discounts and commissions we refer to this as the “class b conversion” each share of our class b common stock converted into 1118440 shares of our class a common stock as a result of the class b conversion we issued an aggregate of 88484700 shares of our class a common stock 

 

  

reverse stock split 

immediately following the class b conversion we effected a 3294 for one reverse stock split of our then outstanding shares of class a common stock including those shares of our class a common stock issued as part of the class b conversion which decreased the number of shares of our class a common stock immediately after the class b conversion from 88490028 shares to 26861523 shares we refer to this as the “reverse stock split” 

treatment of series a preferred stock 

the certificate of designations for our series a preferred stock prior to our initial public offering provided for the mandatory conversion of the series a preferred stock to class a common stock in the event of an initial public offering so that our series a preferred stock is converted into the same class of our common stock that is to be offered in an initial public offering taking into account of the value rights and preferences of our series a preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designations to our series a preferred stock and our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering promptly following the time we entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the initial public offering each share of our series a preferred stock automatically converted into a number of shares of our class a common stock equal to the sum of a the quotient obtained by dividing iw the amount paid for such share of series a preferred stock plus x an increase to such amount equal to 14 per annum calculated and compounded quarterly on the basis of a 360day year of twelve 30day months and which increased amount shall be deemed to have accrued on a daily basis the “series a preferred return” by ii the public offering price net of underwriting discounts and commissions plus b the product of y a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of shares of our series a preferred stock outstanding at such time and z an additional number of shares of our class a common stock that when added to the number of shares of our class a common stock outstanding at such time including after giving effect to the class b conversion and the reverse stock split equaled 243 of the number of shares of our class a common stock outstanding at such time excluding the shares issued pursuant to clause a above we refer to this as the “series a preferred conversion” each share of our series a preferred stock converted into 1724976 shares of our class a common stock ie the “series a preferred conversion ratio” as a result of the series a preferred conversion we issued an aggregate of 19511018 shares of our class a common stock 

reclassification of class a common stock 

after giving effect to the class b conversion the reverse stock split and the series a preferred conversion there were 46372541 shares of class a common stock which were reclassified as common stock 

  

initial public offering 

on february 17 2010 the company completed its initial public offering of 18750000 shares of its common stock at a price of 1300 per share in addition the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 1950500 shares of the company’s common stock from the company on march 18 2010 we received a total of approximately 2479 million in net proceeds from the initial public offering and underwriters’ option exercise after deducting the underwriting discounts and expenses immediately following the corporate reorganization the ipo and underwriters’ option exercise we had 67529290 total shares of common stock outstanding 

components of net sales and expenses 

net sales 

substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our generators and other engine powered products for the residential commercial industrial and construction markets we also sell engines to certain customers and service parts to our dealer network net sales which include shipping and handling charges billed to customers are recognized upon shipment of products to our customers related freight costs are included in cost of sales our generators and other products are fueled by natural gas liquid propane gasoline diesel or bifuel™ systems with power output from 800w to 9mw our products are primarily manufactured and assembled at our wisconsin and mexico facilities and distributed through thousands of outlets across north america our smaller kw generators for the residential portable and commercial markets are typically built to stock while our larger kw products for the industrial markets are generally customized and built to order 

during 2012 our net sales were affected primarily by the us economy as sales outside of the united states represented only approximately 7 of total net sales 

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 7 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 and our top ten customers representing less than 29 of our net sales for the same period 

 

  

  

costs of goods sold 

the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised over 85 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2012   the principal component parts are engines and alternators we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our products smaller than 20kw we source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our products larger than 20kw we design all the alternators for our units and manufacture alternators for certain of our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable high quality and value oriented suppliers 

the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes and in the manufacturing of the components we source are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing product design improvements and price increases in our products however there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing facilities factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies support and maintenance although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our marketing distribution engineering information systems human resources finance risk management legal and tax functions all of these categories include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs and taxes we typically classify our operating expenses into four categories selling and service research and development general and administrative and amortization of intangibles 

selling and service our selling and service expenses consist primarily of personnel expense marketing expense warranty expense and other sales expenses our personnel expense recorded in selling and services expenses includes the expense of our sales force responsible for our national accounts and other personnel involved in the marketing and sales of our products warranty expense which is recorded at the time of sale is estimated based on historical trends our marketing expenses include direct mail costs printed material costs product display costs market research expenses trade show expenses and media advertising marketing expenses generally increase as our sales efforts increase and are related to the launch of new product offerings and opportunities within selected markets or associated with specific events such as awareness marketing in areas impacted by major power outages participation in trade shows and other events 

research and development our research and development expenses support over 130 active research and development projects we currently operate five advanced engineering facilities and employ over 200 engineers who focus on new product development existing product improvement and cost reduction our commitment to research and development has resulted in a significant portfolio of approximately 90 us and international patents and patent applications our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 

general and administrative our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for general and administrative employees accounting and legal professional services fees information technology costs insurance travel and entertainment expense and other corporate expense 

amortization of intangibles our amortization of intangibles expenses include the straightline amortization of customer lists patents and other intangibles assets 

  

  

goodwill and trade name goodwill primarily represents the excess of amount paid over the fair market value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consist of trade names the fair value of trade names is measured using a relieffromroyalty approach which assumes the fair value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had we not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a noncash charge which primarily related to the write down of a certain trade name we refer you to note 2 “critical accounting policies—goodwill and other intangible assets” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information about this charge 

other income expense 

our other income expense includes the interest expense on our outstanding borrowings and amortization of debt financing costs in november 2006 we entered into a 9500 million first lien term loan 4300 million second lien term loan and 1500 million revolving credit facility in february 2010 we used the net proceeds from the initial closing of the initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loan in full and to pay down a portion of our first lien term loan in addition in march 2010 december 2010 april 2011 and december 2011 we used cash and cash equivalents on hand to further pay down our first lien term loan principal in february 2012 we paid our debt down further and entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement provided for borrowings under a 1500 million revolving credit facility a 3250 million tranche a term loan facility and a 2500 million tranche b term loan facility in may 2012 we amended and restated our existing credit agreement by entering into the term loan credit agreement and the abl credit agreement the term loan credit agreement provides for a 9000 million term loan and a 1250 million uncommitted incremental term loan facility and the abl credit agreement provides for borrowings under a 1500 million abl facility and an uncommitted 500 million incremental credit facility no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011   the amounts borrowed under our term loans bear interest at rates based upon either a base rate or libor plus an applicable margin we also earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents which is included in other income expense we also recorded expenses related to interest rate swap agreements which had a notional amount of 3000 million outstanding at december 31 2011 at an average rate of 15 and a notional amount of 3000 million outstanding at december 31 2012 at an average rate of 20 other income expense may also include other financial items such as gainloss on extinguishment of debt 

costs related to acquisition in 2012 our other expenses include onetime transactionrelated expenses related to the acquisition of the ottomotores businesses in 2011 our other expenses include onetime transactionrelated expenses related to the acquisition of the magnum business 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

  

  

net sales net sales increased 3843 million or 485 to 11763 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 7920 million for the year ended december 31 2011 this increase was driven by a 2144 million or a 437 increase in residential product sales largely driven by increased demand created by major power outages in recent quarters along with expanded distribution and new product offerings commercial  industrial product sales increased 1601million or 640 driven primarily by the additional magnum products revenue and to a lesser extent increased shipments of natural gas backup generators 

gross profit gross profit increased 1457 million or 495 to 4404 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 2947 million for the year ended december 31 2011 gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2012 increased to 374 from 372 for the year ended december 31 2011 gross margin increased over the prior year primarily due to the positive impact from price increases improved manufacturing overhead absorption and moderation in commodity costs relative to the prior year these margin improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from the addition of magnum products sales 

operating expenses operating expenses increased 352 million to 2168 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 1817 million for the year ended december 31 2011 these additional expenses were driven primarily by operating expenses associated with magnum increased sales engineering and administrative infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives and higher baseline sales levels of the company increased incentive compensation expenses as a result of the company’s financial performance during the year and increased variable expenses resulting from the increase in organic sales 

other expense other expense increased 412 million or 1583 to 672 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 260 million for the year ended december 31 2011 interest expense increased by 254 million or 1071 as a result of the higher debt levels from the may 2012 refinancing transaction in addition losses on extinguishment of debt increased 139 million in 2012 as a result of the february 2012 and may 2012 debt refinancing transactions 

income tax expense income tax expense increased 3008 million to a provision of 631 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from a benefit of 2377 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the large income tax benefit in the prior year consisted primarily of the reversal of the full valuation allowance on the company’s net deferred tax assets we refer you to note 9 “income taxes” of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

net income as a result of the factors identified above we generated net income of 932 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to net income of 3246 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in net income is due to the items previously described 

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda as reconciled in “item 6  selected financial data” increased to 2898 million compared to 1885 million in 2011 due to the factors discussed above

net sales net sales increased 1991 million or 336 to 7920 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 5929 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was driven by a 1182 million or a 317 increase in residential product sales largely driven by demand created by the major power outages in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 the frequency and duration of these major outages in certain regions of the country led to a surge in demand for portable generators as well as increased awareness and accelerated adoption of home standby generators commercial and industrial product sales increased 667 million or 363 magnum products contributed 365 million during the fourth quarter of 2011 in addition overall capital spending from our national account customers and strong demand for our large industrial systems also contributed to increased commercial and industrial sales other product sales increased 141 million mainly due to stronger service parts sales as a result of the major power outage events during the second half of 2011 magnum products also contributed 23 million to service parts sales during the fourth quarter of 2011 

gross profit gross profit increased 573 million or 241 to 2947 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 2374 million for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily due to the factors affecting net sales described above as a percent of net sales gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased to 372 from 400 for the year ended december 31 2010 this decline is primarily attributable to a higher sales mix of lower margin portable generators during 2011 and the mix impact from the addition of the magnum products business during the fourth quarter of 2011 to a lesser extent higher commodity costs versus the prior year also contributed to the yearoveryear gross margin decline 

operating expenses operating expenses increased 346 million to 1817 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 1471 million for the year ended december 31 2010 selling and service expenses increased 198 million due to higher variable operating expenses and incentive compensation as a result of higher sales experienced during 2011 general and administration costs increased 74 million mainly due to increased incentive compensation and incremental stockbased compensation expense operating expenses also increased in 2011 as a result of investments made in infrastructure to support the strategic growth initiatives of the company in addition in the fourth quarter of 2011 the company recorded a 94 million noncash charge which primarily related to the write down of a certain trade name as we strategically transition to the generac brand the fourth quarter of 2011 also includes operating expenses of the magnum products business 

other expense other expense decreased 71 million or 213 to 260 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 331 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this decrease was driven by a decline in interest expense of 37 million as a result of approximately 134 million of debt prepayments made over the last thirteen months in addition there was a 44 million decrease in the writeoff of deferred financing costs related to debt extinguishment partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases are transaction costs related to the magnum products acquisition totaling 09 million 

income tax expense income tax expense decreased 2380 million to a benefit of 2377 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 03 million for the year ended december 31 2010 due to a reversal of the full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets see discussion in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – note 9 for additional information

3 pension obligations are excluded from this table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment due to the inherent assumptions underlying the obligation however the company estimates we will contribute 10 million to our pension plans in 2013 

capital expenditures 

our operations require capital expenditures for technology tooling equipment capacity expansion and upgrades capital expenditures were 224 million and 121 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and were funded through cash from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for selected dealers this arrangement provides liquidity for our dealers by financing dealer purchases of products with credit availability from the finance company we receive payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer and our dealers are given a longer period of time to pay the finance provider if our dealers do not pay the finance company we may be required to repurchase the applicable inventory held by the dealer 

total inventory financed accounted for approximately 6 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 and approximately 7 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 the amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding was 100 million and 166 million as of december 31 2011 and 2012 respectively 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company including information about contingencies risk and financial condition the company believes given current facts and circumstances that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to accounting principles generally accepted in the us and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property plant and equipment and prepaid expenses management believes the company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment defined benefit pension obligations estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty other contingencies derivative accounting income taxes and share based compensation 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired from business acquisitions goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of impairment are present the company conducts its annual impairment test for goodwill on october 31 st of each year conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset 

 

the company uses a twostep process to test for goodwill impairment first the reporting units fair value is compared to its carrying value fair value is estimated using a combination of qualitative analyses a discounted cash flow approach and a market approach if a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value an indication exists that the reporting units goodwill may be impaired and the second step of the impairment test would be performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the potential impairment loss in the second step the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation the implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 

 

  

  

the company performed the required annual impairment tests for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 and found no impairment of goodwill 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consist of trade names the company tests the carrying value these trade names by comparing the assets fair value to its carrying value fair value was measured using a relieffromroyalty approach which assumes the fair value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had the company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company the company conducts its annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets on october 31 st of each year 

 

the company performed the required annual impairment tests for fiscal years 2012 and 2010 and found no impairment of indefinitelived trade names during the fourth quarter of 2011 the company decided to strategically transition certain products to their more widely known generac brand based on this decision the company recorded a 94 million noncash trade name impairment charge as of october 31 2011 which primarily related to the write down of the impacted trade name to net realizable value 

 

we can make no assurances that remaining goodwill or indefinitelived trade names will not be impaired in the future when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year additionally since our measurement also considers a market approach changes in comparable public company multiples can also materially impact our impairment analysis 

in the long term our remaining goodwill and indefinitelived trade name balances could be further impaired in future periods a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue operating costs and other relevant factors if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our business may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

defined benefit pension obligations 

the funded status of our pension plans is more fully described in note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k as discussed in note 9 the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2012 used a discount rate of 410 for the salaried pension plan and 414 for the hourly pension plan our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moodys aa or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations given this policy we expect to make 10 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2013 

allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty reserves and other contingencies 

the reserves if any for customer rebates product warranty product liability litigation excess and obsolete inventory and doubtful accounts are factspecific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations historical experience and current and expected economic conditions these reserves are reflected under notes 2 4 5 and 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

  

derivative accounting 

we have interest rate swap contracts or the swaps in place to fix a portion of our variable rate indebtedness due to the incorporation of a new interest rate floor provision in the term loan credit agreement which constitutes a change in critical terms the company concluded that as of may 30 2012 the outstanding swaps would no longer be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows during the periods the hedges are designated as a result the company was required to dedesignate the hedges as of may 30 2012 beginning may 31 2012 the effective portion of the swaps prior to the change ie amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss have been and will continue to be amortized as interest expense over the period of the originally designated hedged transactions which have various dates through october 2013 future changes in fair value of the swaps have been and will continue to be immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as interest expense 

as required by asc 815 derivatives and hedging we record the swaps at fair value pursuant to asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value when determining the fair value of the swaps we considered our credit risk in accordance with asc 820 the fair value of the swaps including the impact of credit risk at december 31 2012 and 2011 was a liability of 30 million and 53 million respectively 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal state and international income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 

we have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences as well as significant net operating loss carryforwards in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment as of september 30 2011 we were in a three year cumulative loss position and had a full valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2011 we came out of a threeyear cumulative loss position and as part of the normal assessment of the future realization of our net deferred tax assets determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required as a result the valuation allowance previously recorded was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and was recorded as a component of the income tax provision 

ottomotores brazil acquired in the ottomotores acquisition in december 2012 is in a threeyear cumulative net loss position and therefore we have not considered expected future taxable income in analyzing the realizability of their deferred tax assets as of december 31 2012 as a result a full valuation allowance was recorded in the opening balance sheet for the deferred tax assets of ottomotores brazil 

in performing the assessment of the realization of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2012 excluding ottomotores brazil we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance is required 

share based compensation 

under the fair value recognition provisions of asc 718 compensation – stock compensation  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends and market volatility of our stock in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates to reduce the risk from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we use financial instruments from time to time we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

 

  

  

foreign currency 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of purchasing from suppliers in other countries periodically we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases in the normal course of business contracts typically have maturities of one year or less realized and unrealized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 

on february 18 2010 we entered into a tenmonth foreign currency average rate option transaction for euros with a total notional amount of 25 million and a termination date of december 31 2010 total losses recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for foreign currency contracts were 100000 the primary objective of this hedging activity is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of the euro on our financial results 

with the purchase of the ottomotores businesses in december 2012 a small portion of revenues and expenses are now denominated in mexican pesos and brazilian real 

commodity prices 

we are a purchaser of commodities and of components manufactured from commodities including steel aluminum copper and others as a result we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process depending on the supplier these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies or supply chain savings to offset increases in commodity costs 

periodically we engage in certain commodity risk management activities the primary objectives of these activities are to understand and mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results generally these risk management transactions will involve the use of commodity derivatives to protect against exposure resulting from significant price fluctuations 

we primarily utilize commodity contracts with maturities of one year or less these are intended to offset the effect of price fluctuations on actual inventory purchases the primary objective of the hedge is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of copper on our financial results as of december 31 2012 we had the following commodity forward contracts outstanding in thousands 

 

 

for additional information on the company’s commodity forward contracts including amounts charged to the statement of comprehensive income during 2012 see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2012 a portion of the outstanding debt under our term loans was subject to floating interest rate risk as of this date we had the following interest rate swap contracts outstanding in thousands 

 

 

at december 31 2012 the fair value of the swaps reduced for our credit risk and excluding related accrued interest was a liability of 30 million for additional information on the company’s interest rate swaps including amounts charged to the statement of comprehensive income during 2012 see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k even after giving effect to these swaps we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our term loans that are not covered by the swaps a hypothetical change in the libor interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed annual cash interest expense by approximately 05 million or without the swaps in place 03 million the existence of a 125 libor floor provision in our new term loan credit agreement effective may 30 2012 significantly limits the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point change in libor at current december 31 2012 libor rates 

due to the incorporation of a new interest rate floor provision in the term loan credit agreement which constitutes a change in critical terms the company concluded that as of may 30 2012 the outstanding swaps would no longer be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows during the periods the hedges are designated as a result the company was required to dedesignate the hedges as of may 30 2012 beginning may 31 2012 the effective portion of the swaps prior to the change ie amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss have been and will continue to be amortized as interest expense over the period of the originally designated hedged transactions which have various dates through october 2013 future changes in fair value of the swaps have been and will continue to be immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as interest expense

competition 

the market for onsite standby generators is competitive we face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers abroad however most of the traditional participants in the standby generator market compete on a more specialized basis focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix we are the only significant market participant focused predominantly on standby and portable generators with broad capabilities across the residential industrial and lightcommercial generator markets we believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a firstmover advantage over our competition for product innovation we also believe our broad product offering and diverse distribution model provide for additional advantages as well 

in the market for standby commercial and industrial generators our primary competitors are caterpillar cummins kohler and mtu most of which focus on the market for diesel generators as they are also diesel engine manufacturers in the market for residential standby generators our primary competitors include briggs  stratton cummins onan division and kohler which also have broad operations in other manufacturing businesses in the portable generator market our primary competitors include briggs  stratton honda and techtronics international tti along with a number of smaller domestic and foreign competitors in the market for mobile generators our primary competitors are doosanir aggreko caterpiller and wacker our competitors in the market for light towers include terex allmand and wacker 

there are a number of other standby generator manufacturers located outside north america but most supply their products mainly to their respective regional markets in a continuously evolving sector we believe our size and broad capabilities make us well positioned to remain competitive 

we compete primarily on the basis of brand reputation quality reliability pricing innovative features breadth of product and product availability

 item 1a risk factors 

 

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this report 

 

risk factors related to our business and industry 

 

demand for our products is significantly affected by unpredictable major poweroutage events that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms blackouts and other grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory the lack of major poweroutage events can affect our net sales in the years following a given storm season unpredictable fluctuations in demand are therefore part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits despite their unpredictable nature we believe major power outages create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products

 

  

  

demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine and modular technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected additionally timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quartertoquarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets 

 

decreases in the availability and quality or increases in the cost of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 

 

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies and have substantially greater financial resources some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for more information see “item 1—business—competition” 

 

our industry is subject to technological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

  

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures their introduction may be delayed they may have higher production costs than originally expected or they may not be accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

  

  

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label telecommunications retail or equipment rental customers would adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large telecommunications retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors and customers with whom we do business offer products and services of our competitors impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 

 

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we view our intellectual property rights as important assets we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business if it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements furthermore in connection with our sale of generac portable products to the beacon group in 1998 we granted the beacon group an exclusive perpetual license for the use of the “generac portable products” trademark in connection with the manufacture and sale of certain engine driven consumer products this perpetual license was eventually transferred to briggs and stratton briggs when the beacon group sold that business to briggs currently this trademark is not being used in commerce however in the event that the beacon group or briggs use this trademark in the future we could suffer competitive confusion and our business could be negatively impacted 

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

  

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

 

  

  

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions and noise including standards imposed by the federal environmental protection agency or epa state regulatory agencies such as carb and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our projects or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example  we were required to modify our sparkignited aircooled gaseous engines to comply with the 2011 epa and carb regulations as well as the continued implementation of tier 4 nonroad diesel engine changes associated with the magnum acquisition typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 

 

we may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability 

 

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the power products industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

 

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the vast majority of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 100mile radius we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 

 

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia and europe our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations 

 

  

  

as a us corporation that sources components in foreign countries we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act a determination that we violated this act may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

as a us corporation we are subject to the regulations imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

 

we have significant tax assets usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future 

 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 1271 million of net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes   any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section 382 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 including through sales of stock by large stockholders all of which are outside of our control could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities 

 

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired in the future net income could be materially adversely affected 

 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names at december 31 2011 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 6959 million most of which arose from the ccmp transactions   we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles such as the 94 million noncash charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily related to the write down of a certain trade name as we strategically transition to the generac brand could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with fasb asc accounting standards codification topic 35020 goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment and definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of the acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances the amount of any impairment is recorded as a charge to the statement of operations we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of intangible assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for details 

 

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit our ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies in february 2012 we completed the planned refinancing of our former credit facility and the new credit facility is comprised of a 150 million unfunded revolver a 325 million term loan a and 250 million term loan b the revolver and term loan a both have a five 5 year term with interest payable on a leveragedbased pricing grid starting at libor plus 225 the term loan b matures in seven 7 years and accrues interest at libor plus 275 with a libor floor of 10 for more information regarding the refinance of our credit facility see “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – “16 subsequent events” in the future if we are unable to refinance such facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected 

 

  

  

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales 

 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of the magnum products business or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the magnum products acquisition which was consummated on october 3 2011 will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the magnum products business with our business the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the magnum products business with ours the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the magnum products business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

in addition the overall integration of the magnum products business may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention and may cause our stock price to decline 

 

the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of the magnum products business are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of the magnum products business with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

 

risks related to our common stock 

 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material 

 

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

  

  

risks related to our capital structure 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2011 we had total indebtedness of 5979 million as of february 9 2012 our total indebtedness was further reduced to 5750 million while we reduced this amount of debt during 2010 2011 and 2012 through the use of the proceeds of our ipo and of cash on hand including an additional prepayment of debt of 742 million in december of 2010 247 million in april of 2011 346 million in december of 2011 and 229 million in february 2012 as discussed elsewhere in this report under “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we still have a significant amount of indebtedness our significant level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our significant indebtedness combined with our lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences for example it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of the abovelisted factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows while we maintain interest rate swaps covering a significant portion of our outstanding debt our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our senior secured credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 

  

the terms of our senior secured credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

 

our former senior secured credit facilities contained and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests our new senior secured credit facilities entered into on february 9 2012 include certain financial covenants 

 

the new credit facility requires generac power systems to maintain a maximum leverage ratio as defined in the senior secured credit facility of 400 to 100 from the periods june 30 2012 to september 30 2012 and 375 to 100 thereafter as of december 31 2011 generac power systems leverage ratio was 283 in addition the new credit facility requires generac power systems to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the senior secured credit facility of 250 to 100 from june 30 2012 to september 30 2012 275 to 100 from december 31 2012 to june 30 2013 300 to 100 from september 30 2013 to june 30 2014 and 325 to 100 thereafter as of december 31 2011 generac power systems’ interest coverage ratio was 855 failure to comply with such covenants would result in an event of default under our new senior secured credit facilities unless waived by our lenders 

 

our new senior secured credit facilities require us to use a portion of excess cash flow and proceeds of certain asset sales that are not reinvested in our business and other dispositions to repay indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 

 

  

  

our new senior secured credit facilities also include covenants restricting among other things our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our new senior secured credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our new senior secured credit facilities would result in a default under our new senior secured credit facilities if any such default occurs the lenders under our new senior secured credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings 

 

our principal stockholder continues to have substantial control over us 

 

affiliates of ccmp collectively beneficially own approximately 590 of our outstanding common stock as a consequence ccmp or its affiliates are able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and will control matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors a merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant transaction the interests of this stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders for instance this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price 

 

because affiliates of ccmp control more than 50 of the voting power of our common stock we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the nyses listed company manual under the nyses listed company manual a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain nyse corporate governance requirements including requirements that 1 a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and 3 director nominees be selected or recommended by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors because we have taken advantage of the controlled company exemption to certain nyse corporate governance requirements our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirements 

 

  

  

c onflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our principal stockholder 

 

representatives of ccmp and its affiliates occupy seats on our board of directors ccmp or its affiliates could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us or companies in which ccmp or its affiliates are currently invested may already compete with us as a result of these relationships when conflicts arise between the interests of ccmp or its affiliates and the interests of our stockholders these directors may not be disinterested the representatives of ccmp and its affiliates on our board of directors by the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “item 6  selected financial data” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those set forth under “item 1a  risk factors” 

  

  

overview 

we are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of generators and other engine powered products for the residential light commercial industrial and commercial markets as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the power equipment market in the united states and canada we design manufacture source and modify engines alternators automatic transfer switches and other components necessary for our products our generators and other products are fueled by natural gas liquid propane gasoline diesel and bifuel™ and are available through a broad network of independent dealers retailers and wholesalers and equipment rental companies 

 

business drivers and measures 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of industry trends performance measures and operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 

industry trends 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable power solutions by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important trends affecting our industry including the following 

increasing penetration opportunity although there have been recent increases in product costs for installed standby generators in the residential and lightcommercial markets driven in the last two years by raw material costs these costs have declined overall over the last decade and many potential customers are not aware of the costs and benefits of backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for residential products are approximately 25 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2009 american housing survey for the united states and penetration rates of many lightcommercial outlets such as restaurants drug stores and gas stations are significantly lower than penetration of hospitals and industrial locations we believe that by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators 

impact of residential investment cycle the market for residential generators is affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income or net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have a material impact on demand for residential generators 

effect of large scale power disruptions power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators disruptions in the aging us power grid and other outage activity increase product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months for standby generators while there are power outages every year across all regions of the country major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period 

impact of business capital investment cycle the market for commercial and industrial stationary and mobile generators and other power equipment is affected by the capital investment cycle and overall nonresidential construction and durable goods spending as businesses either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment these trends can have a material impact on demand for these products the capital investment cycle may differ for the various industrial and commercial end markets that we serve industrial telecommunications distribution retail health care facilities construction energy and municipal infrastructure among others the market for these products is also affected by general economic conditions credit availability and trends in durable goods spending by businesses 

  

  

operational factors 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing and cost control the operational factors that affect our business include the following 

new product startup costs when we launch new products we generally experience an increase in startup costs including engineering expenses expediting costs testing expenses marketing expenses and warranty costs resulting in lower gross margins after the initial launch of a new product margins on new product introductions generally increase over the life of the product as these startup costs decline and we focus our engineering efforts on product cost reduction 

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum and other components we use in our products together with foreign currency fluctuations can have a material impact on our results of operations we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of rising commodity currency and component prices through improved product design manufacturing efficiencies price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are borne by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 

 

other factors 

other factors that affect our results of operations include the following 

factors influencing interest expense interest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors including market fluctuations in libor interest rate election periods interest rate swap agreements and repayments of indebtedness interest expense decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to approximately 134 million of debt prepayments made over the last thirteen months 

factors influencing provision for income taxes because we made a section 338h10 election in connection with the ccmp transactions we have 12 billion of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december 31 2011 that we expect to generate cash tax savings of 470 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate   the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 48 million through 2020 and 40 million in 2021 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate additionally we have federal net operating loss or nol carryforwards of 1271 million as of december 31 2011 which we expect to generate an additional 44 million of federal cash tax savings at a 35 rate when and if utilized   based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2021 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes however any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section 382 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 including through sales of stock by large stockholders all of which are outside of our control could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities 

 

in addition as a result of the asset acquisition of magnum we have approximately 570 million of tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets remaining as of december 31 2011 we expect these assets to generate tax savings of 222 million through 2026 assuming continued profitability and a 39 tax rate the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 38 million annually through 2025 and 29 million in 2026 which generates an additional annual cash tax savings of 15 million through 2025 and 11 million in 2026 assuming profitability and a 39 tax rate 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past three years approximately 16 to 24 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 20 to 25 in the second quarter 25 to 30 in the third quarter and 26 to 34 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the timing of outage activity in each year such as the outage activity experienced in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 due to the significant demand and awareness created by these outage events in the second half of 2011 we expect growth rates during 2012 to be heavily weighted toward the first half of the year assuming no material improvement in the macroeconomic environment and no comparable outage events in 2012 because of this our historical seasonality patterns may not apply in 2012 

we maintain a flexible production schedule in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand but typically increase production levels in the second and third quarters of each year 

  

  

transactions with ccmp 

in november 2006 affiliates of ccmp together with certain other investors and members of our management purchased an aggregate of 689 million of our equity capital in addition on november 10 2006 generac power systems borrowed an aggregate of 138 billion consisting of an initial drawdown of 950 million under a 11 billion first lien secured credit facility and 430 million under a 430 million second lien secured credit facility with the proceeds from these equity and debt financings together with cash on hand at generac power systems we 1 acquired all of the capital stock of generac power systems and repaid certain pretransaction indebtedness of generac power systems for 20 billion 2 paid 66 million in transaction costs related to the transaction and 3 retained 3 million for general corporate purposes for additional information concerning these and other historical transactions with ccmp see “item 1—business—history—ccmp transactions” 

during 2007 affiliates of ccmp acquired 803 million principal amount of second lien term loans for approximately 600 million ccmps affiliates exchanged this debt for additional shares of class b common stock the fair value of the shares exchanged was 600 million we recorded this transaction as additional class b common stock of 600 million based on the fair value of the debt contributed by ccmps affiliates which approximated the fair value of shares exchanged the debt was held in treasury at face value consequently we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of 188 million which includes the writeoff of deferred financing fees and other closing costs in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 

during 2008 affiliates of ccmp acquired 1489 million principal amount of second lien term loans for approximately 811 million ccmps affiliates exchanged 240 million principal amount of this debt for additional shares of class b common stock and 1249 million principal amount of this debt for shares of our series a preferred stock the fair value of the shares of our class b common stock and series a preferred stock so exchanged was 182 million and 629 million respectively we recorded this transaction as series a preferred stock of 629 million and class b common stock of 182 million based on the fair value of the debt contributed by ccmps affiliates which approximated the fair value of shares exchanged the debt was held in treasury at face value consequently we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of 654 million which includes the writeoff of deferred financing fees and other closing costs in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 

as of september 30 2008 we failed to satisfy the leverage ratio in our senior secured credit facilities as permitted by the credit agreement in november 2008 this violation was remedied by an equity contribution of 15500000 from affiliates of ccmp in exchange for 1550 shares of series a preferred stock 

during 2009 affiliates of ccmp acquired 99 million principal amount of first lien term loans and 200 million principal amount of second lien term loans for approximately 148 million ccmps affiliates exchanged this debt for 14754596 shares of series a preferred stock the fair value of the shares exchanged was 148 million we recorded this transaction as additional series a preferred stock of 148 million based on the fair value of the debt contributed by ccmps affiliates which approximated the fair value of shares exchanged the debt was held in treasury at face value consequently we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of 147 million which includes a writeoff of deferred financing fees and other closing costs in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2009 

in connection with such issuances of our class b common stock to affiliates of ccmp in connection with debt exchanges in 2007 and 2008 and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the shareholders agreement that arose from such issuances affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of our class b common stock they were issued in connection with such debt exchanges to an entity affiliated with ccmp certain other investors and certain members of our management and board of directors in addition in connection with such issuances of our series a preferred stock to affiliates and ccmp in connection with debt exchanges in 2008 and 2009 and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the shareholders agreement that arose from such issuances during the year ended december 31 2009 we issued 2000 shares of series a preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of 200 million in cash to an entity affiliated with ccmp and certain members of management and our board of directors and affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of series a preferred stock they were previously issued in connection with such debt exchanges to an entity affiliated with ccmp and a member of the board of directors at the same price 

corporate reorganization 

our capitalization prior to the initial public offering consisted of series a preferred stock class b common stock and class a common stock our series a preferred stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a 14 annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares and equity participation equal to 243 of the remaining equity value of the company our class b common stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a 10 annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares in connection with the initial public offering we undertook a corporate reorganization which gave effect to the conversion of our series a preferred stock and class b common stock into the same class of our common stock that was sold in our initial public offering while taking into account the rights and preference of those shares including the priority returns of our series a preferred stock and our class b common stock and the equity participation rights of the series a preferred stock a reverse stock split was needed to reduce the number of shares to be issued to holders of our class a and class b common stock to the number that correctly reflected the proportionate interest of such stockholders in our company taking into account the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon the conversion of our series a preferred stock and the number and value of shares of common stock to be issued and sold to new investors in the initial public offering we refer to these transactions as the “corporate reorganization” the specific steps in the corporate reorganization were as follows 

  

  

treatment of class b common stock 

our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering provided for the mandatory conversion of our class b voting common stock to class a common stock in the event of an initial public offering so that our class b common stock is converted into the same class of our common stock that is to be offered in an initial public offering taking into account of the value rights and preferences of our class b common stock in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering at the time we entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the initial public offering each share of our class b common stock automatically converted into a number of shares of our class a common stock equal to one plus the quotient obtained by dividing ix the amount paid for such share of class b common stock plus y an increase to such amount equal to 10 per annum calculated and compounded quarterly on the basis of a 360day year of twelve 30day months and which increased amount shall be deemed to have accrued on a daily basis ie the “class b return” by ii the public offering price net of underwriting discounts and commissions we refer to this as the “class b conversion” each share of our class b common stock converted into 1118440 shares of our class a common stock ie the “class b conversion ratio” as a result of the class b conversion we issued an aggregate of 88484700 shares of our class a common stock 

reverse stock split 

immediately following the class b conversion we effected a 3294 for one reverse stock split of our then outstanding shares of class a common stock including those shares of our class a common stock issued as part of the class b conversion which decreased the number of shares of our class a common stock immediately after the class b conversion from 88490028 shares to 26861523 shares we refer to this as the “reverse stock split” 

treatment of series a preferred stock 

the certificate of designations for our series a preferred stock prior to our initial public offering provided for the mandatory conversion of the series a preferred stock to class a common stock in the event of an initial public offering so that our series a preferred stock is converted into the same class of our common stock that is to be offered in an initial public offering taking into account of the value rights and preferences of our series a preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designations to our series a preferred stock and our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering promptly following the time we entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the initial public offering each share of our series a preferred stock automatically converted into a number of shares of our class a common stock equal to the sum of a the quotient obtained by dividing iw the amount paid for such share of series a preferred stock plus x an increase to such amount equal to 14 per annum calculated and compounded quarterly on the basis of a 360day year of twelve 30day months and which increased amount shall be deemed to have accrued on a daily basis the “series a preferred return” by ii the public offering price net of underwriting discounts and commissions plus b the product of y a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of shares of our series a preferred stock outstanding at such time and z an additional number of shares of our class a common stock that when added to the number of shares of our class a common stock outstanding at such time including after giving effect to the class b conversion and the reverse stock split equaled 243 of the number of shares of our class a common stock outstanding at such time excluding the shares issued pursuant to clause a above we refer to this as the “series a preferred conversion” each share of our series a preferred stock converted into 1724976 shares of our class a common stock ie the “series a preferred conversion ratio” as a result of the series a preferred conversion we issued an aggregate of 19511018 shares of our class a common stock 

reclassification of class a common stock 

after giving effect to the class b conversion the reverse stock split and the series a preferred conversion there were 46372541 shares of class a common stock which were reclassified as common stock 

initial public offering 

on february 17 2010 the company completed its initial public offering of 18750000 shares of its common stock at a price of 1300 per share in addition the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 1950500 shares of the company’s common stock from the company on march 18 2010 we received a total of approximately 2479 million in net proceeds from the initial public offering and underwriters’ option exercise after deducting the underwriting discounts and expenses immediately following the corporate reorganization the ipo and underwriters’ option exercise we had 67529290 total shares of common stock outstanding 

  

  

repayment of debt 

in february 2010 we used 2216 million in net proceeds from the initial closing of the ipo to pay down our second lien term loan in full and to pay down a portion of our first lien term loan in addition in march 2010 december 2010 april 2011 and december 2011 we used 1385 million 742 million 247 million and 346 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents on hand to further pay down our first lien term loan as a result of these debt repayments the outstanding balance on the first lien credit facility has been reduced to 5979 million as of december 31 2011 and our second lien credit facility has been repaid in full and terminated this reduction in debt will have a significant impact on cash flows as a result of lower interest expense in future periods based on current libor rates 

additionally in connection with our refinancing on february 9 2012 we used 229 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand to further pay down our first lien term loan we classified this portion of debt as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2011 

 

components of net sales and expenses 

net sales 

substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our generators and other engine powered products to the residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell engines to certain customers and service parts to our dealer network net sales are recognized upon shipment of products to our customers net sales also includes shipping and handling charges billed to customers which are recognized at the time of shipment of products to our customers related freight costs are included in cost of sales our generators and other products are fueled by natural gas liquid propane gasoline diesel or bifuel™ systems with power output from 800w to 9mw our products are primarily manufactured and assembled at our wisconsin facilities and distributed through thousands of outlets across the united states and canada our smaller kw generators for the residential portable and commercial markets are typically built to stock while our larger kw products for the industrial markets are generally customized and built to order 

our net sales are affected primarily by the us economy as sales outside of the united states represent only approximately 5 of total net sales 

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 8 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 and our top ten customers representing less than 30 of our net sales for the same period 

costs of goods sold 

the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised over 80 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2011   the principal component parts are engines and alternators we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our products smaller than 20kw we source engines for some of our smaller products and all of our products larger than 20kw we design all the alternators for our units and manufacture alternators for certain of our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable lowcost suppliers 

the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes and in the manufacturing of the components we source are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on product design improvements and price increases in our products however there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing facilities which require significant factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies and support and maintenance although we maintain a lowcost largely nonunion workforce and flexible manufacturing processes our margins can be impacted when we cannot promptly decrease labor and manufacturing costs to match declines in net sales 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our marketing distribution engineering information systems human resources finance purchasing risk management legal and tax functions all of these categories include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs and taxes we typically classify our operating expenses into four categories selling and service research and development general and administrative and amortization of intangibles 

  

  

selling and service our selling and service expenses consist primarily of personnel expense marketing expense warranty expense and other sales expenses our personnel expense recorded in selling and services expenses includes the expense of our sales force responsible for our national accounts and other personnel involved in the marketing and sales of our products warranty expense which is recorded at the time of sale is estimated based on historical trends our marketing expenses include direct mail costs printed material costs product display costs market research expenses trade show expenses and media advertising marketing expenses generally increase as our sales efforts increase and are related to the launch of new product offerings and opportunities within selected markets or associated with specific events such as awareness marketing in areas impacted by storms participation in trade shows and other events 

research and development our research and development expenses support over 130 active research and development projects we currently operate four advanced facilities and employ over 150 engineers who focus on new product development existing product improvement and cost reduction our commitment to research and development has resulted in a significant portfolio of approximately 90 us and international patents and patent applications our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 

general and administrative our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for general and administrative employees accounting and legal professional services fees information technology costs insurance travel and entertainment expense and other corporate expense 

amortization of intangibles our amortization of intangibles expenses include the straightline amortization of customer lists patents and other intangibles assets 

goodwill and trade name goodwill primarily represents the excess of the amount paid to acquire us over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired as of the november 2006 date of the ccmp transactions 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consist of trade names the fair value of trade names is measured using a relieffromroyalty approach which assumes the fair value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had we not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company 

in 2011 we recorded a noncash charge which primarily related to the write down of a certain trade name please see “critical accounting policies—goodwill and other intangible assets” for additional detail on this charge 

other income expense 

our other income expense includes the interest expense on the outstanding balances of our 9500 million first lien term loan 4300 million second lien term loan and 1500 million revolving credit facility entered into in november 2006 and the amortization of debt financing costs in february 2010 we used the net proceeds from the initial closing of the initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loan in full and to pay down a portion of our first lien term loan in addition in march 2010 december 2010 april 2011 and december 2011 we used cash and cash equivalents on hand to further pay down our first lien term loan principal no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010   the amounts borrowed under our term loans bear interest at rates based upon either a base rate or libor plus an applicable margin we also earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents which is included in other income expense we also recorded expenses related to interest rate swap agreements which had a notional amount of 3000 million outstanding at december 31 2010 at an average rate of 15 and a notional amount of 3000 million outstanding at december 31 2011 at an average rate of 15 other income expense may also include other financial items such as extinguishment of debt 

costs related to acquisition in 2011 our other expenses include onetime transactionrelated expenses related to the acquisition of the magnum business 

  

  

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 

 

 

net sales net sales increased 1991 million or 336 to 7920 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 5929 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was driven by a 1182 million or a 317 increase in residential product sales largely driven by demand created by the major power outages in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 the frequency and duration of these major outages in certain regions of the country led to a surge in demand for portable generators as well as increased awareness and accelerated adoption of home standby generators commercial and industrial product sales increased 667 million or 363 magnum products contributed 365 million during the fourth quarter of 2011 in addition overall capital spending from our national account customers and strong demand for our large industrial systems also contributed to increased commercial and industrial sales other product sales increased 141 million mainly due to stronger service parts sales as a result of the major power outage events during the second half of 2011 magnum products also contributed 23 million to service parts sales during the fourth quarter of 2011 

  

  

costs of goods sold costs of goods sold increased 1418 million or 399 to 4973 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 3555 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was mainly driven by the increase in sales volume and the addition of magnum products during the fourth quarter 

gross profit gross profit increased 573 million or 241 to 2947 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 2374 million for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily due to the factors affecting net sales and cost of goods sold described above as a percent of net sales gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased to 372 from 400 for the year ended december 31 2010 this decline is primarily attributable to a higher sales mix of lower margin portable generators during 2011 and the mix impact from the addition of the magnum products business during the fourth quarter of 2011 to a lesser extent higher commodity costs versus the prior year also contributed to the yearoveryear gross margin decline 

operating expenses operating expenses increased 346 million to 1817 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 1471 million for the year ended december 31 2010 selling and service expenses increased 198 million due to higher variable operating expenses and incentive compensation as a result of higher sales experienced during 2011 general and administration costs increased 74 million mainly due to increased incentive compensation and incremental stockbased compensation expense operating expenses also increased as a result of investments made in infrastructure in 2011 to support the strategic growth initiatives of the company in addition in the fourth quarter of 2011 the company recorded a 94 million noncash charge which primarily related to the write down of a certain trade name as we strategically transition to the generac brand 

other expense other expense decreased 71 million or 213 to 260 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 331 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this decrease was driven by a decline in interest expense of 37 million as a result of approximately 134 million of debt prepayments made over the last thirteen months in addition there was a 44 million decrease in the writeoff of deferred financing costs related to debt extinguishment partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases are transaction costs related to the magnum products acquisition totaling 09 million 

income tax expense income tax expense decreased 2380 million to a benefit of 2377 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 03 million for the year ended december 31 2011 due to a reversal of the full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets see discussion in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – note 9 for additional information 

net income as a result of the factors identified above we generated net income of 3246 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to a net income of 569 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in net income is due to the items previously described 

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda increased to 1885 million compared to 1562 million in 2010 due to the factors previously discussed 

adjusted net income adjusted net income increased to 1472 million in 2011 compared to 1160 million in 2010 due to the factors discussed above 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 

 

  

 

net sales net sales increased 46 million or 08 to 5929 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 5882 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was driven by a 20 million or a 06 increase in sales to the residential markets due to continued expansion of the company’s distribution network and successful new product launches offset by continued weakness in us residential investment this residential product sales increase was offset by a 38 million or 20 decline in industrial and commercial product sales as a result of market declines in nonresidential construction and reduced capital spending by national account customers although a decrease for the full year industrial and commercial product sales displayed strong momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010 as end markets recovered other product sales increased 64 million as a result of stronger rv oem engine and service parts sales 

costs of goods sold costs of goods sold increased 31 million or 09 to 3555 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 3524 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was driven by a 44 million increase in materials cost primarily due to higher steel copper and aluminum costs as well as by the increase in sales volume partially offset by lower manufacturing overhead costs 

gross profit gross profit increased 15 million or 06 to 2374 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 2359 million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to the factors affecting net sales and cost of goods sold described above as a percentage of net sales gross profit decreased slightly to 400 for the year ended december 31 2010 from 401 for the year ended december 31 2009 

operating expenses operating expenses increased 97 million to 1471 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 1373 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase is due to incremental research and development costs of 39 million related to ongoing product development in addition general and administrative expenses increased 79 million of which 64 million was related to noncash stock compensation expense recorded for the time vesting of equity awards granted in connection with the ipo the remaining increase in administrative costs was associated with additional costs to operate as a public company 

other expense other expense decreased 220 million or 400 to 331 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 551 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this decrease was driven by a decline in interest expense of 435 million as a result of our reduction in indebtedness lower libor rates and the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements offsetting this interest expense decline in 2010 there was a prior year gain on extinguishment of debt of 147 million that did not occur in 2010 as well as the current year writeoff of deferred financing costs related to debt extinguishment of 48 million 

income tax expense income tax expense was 03 million for the year ended december 31 2010 unchanged from the year ended december 31 2009 income tax expense primarily relates to certain state income taxes based on profitability measures other than net income 

net income as a result of the factors identified above we generated net income of 569 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to a net income of 431 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in net income is due to the items previously described 

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda decreased to 1562 million compared to 1591 million in 2009 as modest sales growth and consistent gross margins were more than offset by increased investment in the business adjusted ebitda margins declined slightly in fiscal 2010 to 264 compared to 270 in fiscal 2009 

  

  

adjusted net income adjusted net income increased to 1159 million in 2010 compared to 836 million in 2009 the increase in adjusted net income was attributable to lower interest expense versus prior year 

offset by noncash stock compensation expenses and reduced adjusted ebitda compared to fiscal 2009 

liquidity and financial position 

our primary cash requirements include the payment of our raw material and components suppliers salaries  benefits operating expenses interest and principal payments on our debt and capital expenditures we finance our operations primarily through cash flow generated from operations and if necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility in november 2006 generac power systems entered into a sevenyear 9500 million first lien term loan a sevenandahalf year 4300 million second lien term loan and a sixyear 1500 million revolving credit facility during 2010 and 2011 we used the net proceeds of our initial public offering and a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents on hand totaling 4938 million to pay down our second lien term loans in full and to repay a portion of our first lien term loan as a result of these pay downs the outstanding balance on the first lien credit facility has been reduced to 5979 million as of december 31 2011 and our second lien credit facility has been repaid in full and terminated 

at december 31 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of 931 million and 1442 million of availability under our revolving credit facility our total indebtedness was 5979 million at december 31 2011 

on february 9 2012 generac power systems repaid an additional 229 million against its first lien term loan and entered into a new credit agreement the new credit agreement provides for borrowings under a new fiveyear 1500 million revolving credit facility a fiveyear 3250 million tranche a term loan facility and a sevenyear 2500 million tranche b term loan facility proceeds received by the company from loans made under the new credit agreement were used to repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the former credit agreement dated as of november 10 2006 as amended from time to time and for general corporate purposes as a result of the repayments of debt and refinancing our total indebtedness was 5750 million at february 9 2012 

longterm liquidity 

we believe that our cash flow from operations our availability under our revolving credit facility combined with our low ongoing capital expenditure requirements and favorable tax attributes will provide us with sufficient capital to continue to grow our business in the next twelve months and beyond however even with our reduced leverage we will use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest on our outstanding debt impacting the amount available for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes as we continue to expand our business we may in the future require additional capital to fund working capital capital expenditures or acquisitions

the new credit facilities permit generac power systems to prepay its borrowings under the tranche a term loan facility the tranche b term loan facility and the revolving credit facility subject to the procedures set forth in the new credit agreement applicable to the new credit facilities in certain circumstances generac power systems may be required to make prepayments on its outstanding borrowings under the new credit facilities if it receives proceeds as a result of certain asset sales debt issuances casualty or similar events of loss or if generac power systems has excess cash flow as defined in the new credit facilities 

the new credit agreement contains customary events of default including among others nonpayment of principal interest or other amounts failure to perform covenants inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect crossdefaults with other material indebtedness certain undischarged judgments the occurrence of certain erisa or bankruptcy or insolvency events or the occurrence of a change in control as defined in the new credit agreement upon an event of default under the new credit agreement the lenders may declare the loans and all other obligations under the new credit agreement immediately due and payable and require generac power systems to cash collateralize the outstanding letter of credit obligations a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default causes such obligations to automatically become immediately due and payable

covenant compliance 

the first lien credit facility in place at december 31 2011 required generac power systems to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated total debt net of unrestricted cash and marketable securities to ebitda as defined in such first lien credit facility we refer to the calculation of ebitda under and as defined in such first lien credit facility in this annual report as “covenant ebitda” covenant ebitda and the leverage ratio were calculated based on the four most recently completed fiscal quarters of generac power systems based on the formulations set forth in the first lien credit facility generac power systems was required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 475 to 100 as of december 31 2011 and for the remainder of the term of such first lien credit agreement as of december 31 2011 generac power systems’ leverage ratio was 283 to 100 failure to comply with this covenant would have resulted in an event of default under the first lien credit facility unless waived by the lender thereunder generac power systems was in compliance with the financial covenants under the first lien credit facility as of december 31 2009 december 31 2010 and december 31 2011 additional information on the first lien credit facility can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements – note 6 credit agreements 

the new credit facilities effective february 9 2012 requires generac power systems to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated total debt net of unrestricted cash and marketable securities to ebitda as defined in the new credit agreement and an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to cash interest expense as defined in the new credit agreement the calculation of ebitda under and as defined in the new credit agreement is referred to in this annual report as “covenant ebitda” covenant ebitda the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio are calculated based on the four most recently completed fiscal quarters of generac power systems based on the formulations set forth in the new credit agreement generac power systems is required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 400 to 100 from the periods june 30 2012 to september 30 2012 and 375 to 100 thereafter additionally generac power systems is required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 250 to 100 from june 30 2012 to september 30 2012 275 to 100 from december 31 2012 to june 30 2013 300 to 100 from september 30 2013 to june 30 2014 and 325 to 100 thereafter 

our compliance with the financial covenants and satisfaction of certain leverage based ratios are used in determining among other things the interest rate applicable to the outstanding loans under the new credit facilities the ability to undertake business acquisitions the ability to incur certain types of indebtedness and the amount of dividends and distributions that are permitted to be paid to our stockholders subject to certain exceptions 

an event of default under the new credit facilities could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under such facilities and we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due if there were an event of default as a result of a failure to maintain our required leverage ratio or otherwise it would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity including preventing us from utilizing our revolving credit facility in addition the new credit facilities restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incur additional debt or make certain acquisitions if we are unable to meet our leverage ratio 

in addition to the financial covenant described above the new credit facilities contain certain other affirmative and negative covenants that among other things provide limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness liens on property sale and leaseback transactions investments loans and advances merger or consolidation asset sales acquisitions transactions with affiliates prepayments of any other indebtedness and modifications of generac power systems’ organizational documents

2 assumes all debt will remain outstanding until maturity and using the interest rates in effect for our senior secured credit facilities as of december 31 2011 

3 pension obligations are excluded from this table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment due to the inherent assumptions underlying the obligation however the company estimates we will contribute 29 million to our pension plans in 2012 

 

  

  

capital expenditures 

our operations require capital expenditures for technology tooling equipment capacity expansion and upgrades capital expenditures were 121 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and were funded through cash from operations capital expenditures were 96 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and were also funded through cash from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for selected dealers this arrangement provides liquidity for our dealers by financing dealer purchases of products with credit availability from the finance company we receive payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer and our dealers are given a longer period of time to pay the finance provider if our dealers do not pay the finance company we may be required to repurchase the applicable inventory held by the dealer 

total inventory financed accounted for approximately 7 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 and approximately 6 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 the amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding was 98 million and 100 million as of december 31 2010 and 2011 respectively 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company including information about contingencies risk and financial condition the company believes given current facts and circumstances that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to accounting principles generally accepted in the us and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property plant and equipment and prepaid expenses management believes the company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment defined benefit pension obligations estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty other contingencies derivative accounting income taxes and share based compensation 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and trade names and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a twostep process the first step is the estimation of fair value of the applicable reporting unit estimated fair value is based on management judgments and assumptions with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm and those fair values are compared with our aggregate carrying value of the respective reporting unit if our fair value is greater than the carrying amount there is no impairment if our carrying amount is greater than the fair value then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment if any 

the second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill which is compared to its carrying value the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit at the hypothetical fair value assuming the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of the entire reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 

 

the company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill as of october 31 2011 2010 and 2009 and found no impairment of goodwill 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 the company decided to strategically transition certain products to their more widely known generac brand based on this decision the company recorded a 94 million noncash charge which primarily related to the write down of the impacted trade name to net realizable value in addition the company performed its annual fair valuebased impairment test as of october 31 2011 except as noted no impairment was indicated 

  

  

the company performed its annual fair valuebased impairment test on indefinite lived trade names as of october 31 2010 and 2009 no impairment was indicated 

we can make no assurances that remaining goodwill or trade names will not be impaired in the future when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year additionally since our measurement also considers a market approach changes in comparable public company multiples can also materially impact our impairment analysis 

in the long term our remaining goodwill and trade name balances could be further impaired in future periods a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue operating costs and other relevant factors if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our business may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

defined benefit pension obligations 

the funded status of our pension plans is more fully described in note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report as discussed in note 9 the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2011 used a discount rate of 522 and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 762 our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moodys aa or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 

  

  

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations given this policy we expect to make 29 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2012 

allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty reserves and other contingencies 

the reserves if any for customer rebates product warranty product liability litigation excess and obsolete inventory and doubtful accounts are factspecific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations historical experience and current and expected economic conditions these reserves are reflected under notes 2 4 5 and 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

derivative accounting 

we have interest rate swap contracts or the swaps in place to fix a portion of our variable rate indebtedness for 2007 and 2008 the swaps were deemed highly effective per asc 815 and therefore any changes in fair value of these swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss   as of january 3 2009 in accordance with the terms of our senior secured credit facilities we changed the interest rate election from threemonth libor to onemonth libor as a result we concluded that as of january 3 2009 the swaps no longer met hedge effectiveness criteria under asc 815 future changes in the fair value of the swaps was immediately recognized in our statement of operations as interest expense while the effective portion of the swaps prior to the change remained in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and was amortized as interest expense over the period of the originally designated hedged transactions which ended on january 4 2010 new interest rate swap contracts entered into in fiscal 2010 are deemed highly effective per asc 815 

as required by asc 815 derivatives and hedging we record the swaps at fair value pursuant to asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value when determining the fair value of the swaps we considered our credit risk in accordance with asc 820 the fair value of the swaps including the impact of credit risk at december 31 2011 and 2010 was a liability of 53 million and 41 million respectively 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 

we have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences as well as significant net operating loss carryforwards in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment as of september 30 2011 we were in a three year cumulative loss position and had a full valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2011 we came out of a threeyear cumulative loss position and as part of the normal assessment of the future realization of our net deferred tax assets determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required as a result the valuation allowance previously recorded was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and was recorded as a component of the income tax provision 

share based compensation 

under the fair value recognition provisions of asc 718 compensation – stock compensation  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends and market volatility of our stock in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

for information with respect to new accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates to reduce the risk from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we use financial instruments from time to time we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign currency 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of purchasing from suppliers in other countries periodically we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases in the normal course of business contracts typically have maturities of one year or less realized and unrealized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 

on february 18 2010 we entered into a tenmonth foreign currency average rate option transaction for euros with a total notional amount of 25 million and a termination date of december 31 2010 total losses recognized in the statement of operations for foreign currency contracts were 100000 the primary objective of this hedging activity is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of the euro on our financial results 

commodity prices 

we are a purchaser of commodities and of components manufactured from commodities including steel aluminum copper and others as a result we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process depending on the supplier these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 

periodically we engage in certain commodity risk management activities the primary objectives of these activities are to understand and mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results generally these risk management transactions will involve the use of commodity derivatives to protect against exposure resulting from significant price fluctuations 

  

  

we primarily utilize commodity contracts with maturities of one year or less these are intended to offset the effect of price fluctuations on actual inventory purchases the primary objective of the hedge is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of copper on our financial results as of december 31 2011 we had the following commodity forward contracts outstanding with the fair value gains losses shown in thousands 

 

 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2011 a portion of the outstanding debt under our term loans was subject to floating interest rate risk as of this date we had the following interest rate swap contracts outstanding in thousands 

 

at december 31 2011 the fair value of the swaps reduced for our credit risk and excluding related accrued interest was a liability of 53 million   for further information on these swaps see note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k even after giving effect to these swaps we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our term loans that are not covered by the swaps a hypothetical change in the libor interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed annual cash interest expense by approximately 30 million or without the swaps in place 60 million 

we expect to maintain our existing swaps as highly effective in accordance with asc 815 and therefore any changes in the fair value of the swap would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss

disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report on form 10k based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in this report on form 10k has been recorded processed summarized and reported as of the end of the period covered by this report on form 10k 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the company’s financial statements 

there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error or the circumvention or overriding of the controls accordingly even an effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its objective because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in conducting this assessment our management excluded the magnum products business given its acquisition was only as recent as the fourth quarter 2011 and constituted 7 and 12 of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2011 and 5 and 1 of revenues and net income respectively for the year then ended notwithstanding magnum based on this assessment our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2011 

our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 its report appears in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k on page 47 

 

  

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

on october 3 2011 a subsidiary of the company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of magnum as a result of the acquisition we are in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of magnum and if necessary will make appropriate changes as we incorporate our controls and procedures into the acquired business except for the acquisition there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended december 31 2011 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

other power products comprise 59 51 and 61 respectively of total net sales in 2008 2009 and 2010 

distribution channels and customers 

we distribute our product through several channels to increase awareness of our product categories and the generac® brand and to ensure our products reach a broad customer base this distribution network includes independent residential and industrial dealers electrical wholesalers national accounts private label arrangements retailers catalogs and ecommerce merchants we believe our distribution network is a competitive advantage that we have strengthened over the last decade by expanding our network from our base of industrial dealers to include other channels of distribution as we have increased our product offerings our network is well balanced with no single sales channel providing more than 25 of our sales and no customer providing more than 6 of our sales in 2010 

our dealer network which is located principally in the united states and canada is the industrys largest network of independent generator contractors 

our residential dealer network sells installs and services our residential and lightcommercial products to end users we have developed a number of proprietary dealer management programs to evaluate manage and incentivize our dealers which we believe has an important impact on the high level of customer service we provide to end customers these programs include both technical and sales training under which we train new and existing dealers about our products service and installation we regularly perform market analyses to determine if a given market is either underserved or has poor residential dealer representation within these locations we selectively add distribution or invest resources in existing dealer support and training to improve dealer performance 

our industrial dealer network provides industrial and commercial endusers with ongoing local and nationwide product support our industrial dealers maintain the local relationships with commercial electrical contractors specifying engineers and national account regional buying offices our sales group works in conjunction with our industrial dealers to ensure that national accounts receive engineering support competitive pricing and nationwide service we promote our industrial generators through the use of product demonstrations specifying engineer education events dealer forums and training in recent years we have been particularly focused on expanding our industrial dealer network in canada and latin america in order to expand our international sales opportunities 

our wholesaler network consists of selling branches of both national and local distribution houses for electrical and hvac products our wholesalers distribute our residential and lightcommercial generators and are a key introduction to the standby generator category for electrical and hvac contractors who may not be generac dealers 

on a selective basis we have established arrangements with private label partners to provide residential lightcommercial and industrial generators the partners include leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies each of which provides access to incremental channels of distribution for our products we have agreements in place with these partners having terms of between three and four years and further establishing additional terms and conditions of these arrangements 

our retail distribution network includes thousands of locations and includes regional and national home improvement chains retailers clubs buying groups and farm supply stores these physical retail locations are supplemented by a number of catalogue and ecommerce retailers this network primarily sells our residential standby portable and lightcommercial generators in some cases we have worked with our retail partners to create installation programs using our residential dealers to support the sale and installation of standby generator products sold at retail we also use a combination of display units and advertising through our retail accounts to promote awareness for our products 

additionally we sell some generators and aircooled engines directly to oem manufacturers and aftermarket dealers for use in the rv and lawn and garden industries 

  

  

manufacturing 

our excellence in manufacturing reflects our philosophy of high standards continuous improvement and commitment to quality our facilities showcase our advanced manufacturing techniques and demonstrate the effectiveness of lean manufacturing 

we continually seek to reduce manufacturing costs while improving product quality we deliver an affordable product to our customers through our value engineering philosophy our strategic foreign sourcing our scale and adherence to lean manufacturing principles we believe we have sufficient capacity to achieve our business goals for the near term without the need for significant expansion 

our product quality is essential to maintaining a leading market position incoming shipments from our suppliers are tested to ensure engineering specifications are met purchased components are tested for quality at the supplier’s factory and prior to entering production lines and are continuously tested throughout the manufacturing process internal product and production audits are performed to ensure a quality product and process we test finished products under a variety of simulated conditions at each of our manufacturing facilities 

research and development and intellectual property 

our primary focus on generators drives technological innovation specialized engineering and manufacturing competencies research and development is a core competency and includes a staff of close to 120 engineers working on numerous active projects our sponsored research and development expense was 99 million 108 million and 147 million for the years ended december 2008 2009 and 2010   research and development is conducted at each of our manufacturing facilities and additionally at our technical center in suzhou china with dedicated teams for each product line research and development is focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements as well as maintaining product competitiveness by improving manufacturing costs safety characteristics reliability and performance while ensuring compliance with governmental standards we have had over 30 years of experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology in the residential market we have developed proprietary engines cooling packages controls fuel systems and emissions systems we believe that our expertise in engine powered equipment gives us the capability to develop new products that will allow us to diversify our end markets 

we rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights our commitment to research and development has resulted in a portfolio of approximately 50 us and international patents and patent applications our patents expire between january 2017 and september 2027 and protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems air flow electronics and controls noise reduction and aircooled engines us trademark registrations generally have a perpetual duration if they are properly maintained and renewed new us patents that are issued generally have a life of 20 years from the date the patent application is initially filed we believe the existence of these patents and trademarks along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position we also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment 

suppliers of raw materials 

our primary raw material inputs are steel copper and aluminum all of which are purchased from third parties and in many cases as part of machined or manufactured components we have developed an extensive network of reliable lowcost suppliers in the united states and abroad we continuously evaluate the cost structure of our products and source components accordingly based on this evaluation in 2010 we sourced more than half of our components from outside the united states 

competition 

the market for onsite standby generators is competitive we face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers abroad however most of the traditional participants in the standby generator market compete on a more specialized basis focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix we are the only significant market participant focused predominantly on standby and portable generators with broad capabilities across the residential industrial and lightcommercial generator markets we believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a firstmover advantage over our competition for product innovation 

  

  

our competitors include briggs  stratton caterpillar cummins honda kohler mtu katolight division and techtronics international tti in the market for standby industrial and commercial generators our primary competitors are caterpillar cummins kohler and mtu most of which focus on the market for diesel generators as they are also diesel engine manufacturers in the market for residential standby generators our primary competitors include briggs  stratton cummins onan division and kohler which also have broad operations in other manufacturing businesses in the portable generator market our primary competitors include briggs  stratton honda and techtronics international tti along with a number of smaller domestic and foreign competitors 

there are a number of other standby generator manufacturers located outside north america but most supply their products mainly to their respective regional markets in a continuously evolving sector we believe our size and broad capabilities make us well positioned to remain competitive 

we compete primarily on the basis of brand reputation quality reliability pricing innovative features breadth of product and product availability 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had 1444 employees 1282 full time and 162 parttime and temporary employees of those 818 employees were directly involved in manufacturing at our manufacturing facilities 

we have had an “open shop” bargaining agreement for the past 45 years our current agreement is with the communication workers of america local 5503 the current agreement which expires october 14 2011 covers our waukesha and eagle facilities currently less than 2 of our workforce is a member of a labor union our facility in whitewater wisconsin is not unionized 

regulation including environmental matters 

as a manufacturing company our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition our products are subject to various laws and regulations relating to among other things emissions and fuel requirements as well as labeling and marketing 

our products are regulated by the epa california air resources board carb and various other state and local air quality management districts these governing bodies continuously pass regulations that require us to meet more stringent emission standards with the adoption of a recent regulation covering stationary propane and natural gasfueled generators the epa now regulates all products we produce for sale in the united states new regulations could require us to redesign our products and could affect market growth for our products for example the epa has developed multiple phases of national emission standards for small aircooled engines in 2008 the epa adopted a proposed phase iii regulation that further reduces permitted exhaust emissions from small engines and also requires the engines and equipment in which engines are used to meet new evaporative emission standards the epas phase iii program requires the use of evaporative controls that must be phased in starting in 2009 and take full effect in 2011 for class ii engines 225 cubic center displacement and larger and 2012 for class i engines less than 225 cubic center displacement the phase iii programs more stringent exhaust emission requirements also apply starting in 2011 for class ii engines and 2012 for class i engines the phase iii standards are similar to the carbs tier 3 emission standards which were fully phased in during fiscal year 2008 carbs tier 3 regulation required additional reductions to engine exhaust emissions as well as new controls on evaporative emissions from small engines 

we believe that our operations and our products are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations including environmental and workplace safety regulations we are not subject to any pending investigations claims or proceedings by any foreign federal state or local governmental agency or administration that would materially impact our financial condition or our results

 item 1a risk factors 

 

you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under “forwardlooking statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this report 

 

risk factors related to our business and industry 

 

demand for our products is significantly affected by unpredictable major poweroutage events that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for our products is affected by outage events including thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms and blackouts caused by grid reliability issues the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location and severity of the outages sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales and excess inventory the lack of major poweroutage events can affect our net sales in the quarters following a given storm season unpredictable fluctuations in demand are therefore part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits 

 

demand for our standby generators is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses and other macroeconomic conditions 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities for example lower capital spending by our industrial national accounts and other industrial and commercial customers caused a 99 decline in net sales of our industrial and commercial products in the year ended december 31 2009 this decline continued into the first half of fiscal year 2010 if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected 

 

decreases in the availability or increases in the cost of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 

 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our generators are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts that we utilize to manufacture our generators from third parties the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers manufacturing productivity improvements or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected for example in 2008 we experienced a 48 decrease in gross margin percentage partially due to increases in commodity prices including steel copper and aluminum also our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 

 

  

 

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies and have substantially greater financial resources some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter the generator market demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for more information see “item 1—business—competition” 

 

our industry is subject to technological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

 

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures their introduction may be delayed they may have higher production costs than originally expected or they may not be accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label telecommunications or retail customers would adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large telecommunications retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors and customers with whom we do business offer products and services of our competitors impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 

 

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

 

we view our intellectual property rights including those relating to our generac® brand name fuel management systems and mps technology as important assets we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business if it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 

 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements furthermore in connection with our sale of generac portable products to the beacon group in 1998 we granted the beacon group an exclusive perpetual license for the use of the “generac portable products” trademark in connection with the manufacture and sale of certain engine driven consumer products this perpetual license was eventually transferred to briggs and stratton briggs when the beacon group sold that business to briggs currently this trademark is not being used in commerce however in the event that the beacon group or briggs use this trademark in the future we could suffer competitive confusion and our business could be negatively impacted 

 

  

 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

 

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions and noise including standards imposed by the federal environmental protection agency or epa state regulatory agencies such as carb and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our projects or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example we were required to modify our natural gas and liquid propanefueled liquidcooled engines and generators by january 1 2009 to comply with emissions standards in the united states typically additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market while we have been able to meet previous deadlines failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 

 

we may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 

 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability 

 

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the generator industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

 

currently less than 2 of our workforce is a member of a labor union in addition we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

 

  

 

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition all of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 30mile radius we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption at our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 

 

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations 

 

as a us corporation that sources components in foreign countries we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act a determination that we violated this act may affect our business and operations adversely 

 

as a us corporation we are subject to the regulations imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

 

we have significant tax assets usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 1661 million of net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes   any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section 382 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 including through sales of stock by large stockholders all of which are outside of our control could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities 

 

  

 

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired in the future net income could be materially adversely affected 

 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names at december 31 2010 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 6672 million most of which arose from the ccmp transactions   we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for example in october 2008 due to an increase in our weighted average cost of capital and lower comparable public company market values resulting from weakening economic conditions we determined that an impairment of goodwill existed and recorded a noncash charge of 5032 million in 2008 

 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with fasb asc accounting standards codification topic 35020 goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment and definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of the acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances the amount of any impairment is recorded as a charge to the statement of operations we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of intangible assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for details 

 

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit our ability to grow 

 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including a downturn in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies our revolving credit facility matures in november 2012 and our first lien term loan facility matures in november 2013 if we are unable to refinance these facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected 

 

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes of our products on our net sales 

 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales 

 

risks related to our common stock 

 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material 

 

  

  

as a public company we are required to meet periodic reporting requirements under the securities and exchange commission or sec rules and regulations complying with federal securities laws as a public company is expensive and we will incur significant time and expense enhancing documenting testing and certifying our internal control over financial reporting any deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock 

 

sec rules require that as a publiclytraded company we file periodic reports containing our financial statements within a specified time following the completion of quarterly and annual periods prior to our initial public offering we had not been required to comply with these sec requirements and as such we may experience difficulty in meeting the secs reporting requirements any failure by us to file our periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner could harm our reputation and reduce the trading price of our common stock 

 

as a public company we incur significant incremental legal accounting insurance and other expenses the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as compliance with other rules of the sec and the new york stock exchange or nyse has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more timeconsuming and costly furthermore sec rules require that our chief executive officer and chief financial officer periodically certify the existence and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required beginning with our annual report on form 10k for our fiscal year ending on december 31 2011 to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting this process requires significant documentation of policies procedures and systems review of that documentation by our internal accounting staff and our outside auditors and testing of our internal control over financial reporting by our internal accounting staff this process involves considerable time and expense may strain our internal resources and have an adverse impact on our operating costs we may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses and outside auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter 

 

during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies that would have to be remediated to satisfy the sec rules for certification of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as a consequence we may have to disclose in periodic reports we file with the sec material weaknesses in our system of internal controls the existence of a material weakness would preclude management from concluding that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and would preclude our independent auditors from issuing an unqualified opinion that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in addition disclosures of this type in our sec reports could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and may negatively affect the trading price of our common stock moreover effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting it may negatively impact our business results of operations and reputation 

 

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

  

  

risks related to our capital structure 

 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2010 we had total indebtedness of 6572 million while we reduced this amount of debt during 2010 through the use of the proceeds of our ipo and of cash on hand including an additional prepayment of debt on december 21 2010 of 742 million as discussed elsewhere in this report under “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we still have a substantial amount of indebtedness our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness combined with our lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences for example it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of the abovelisted factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our senior secured credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 

 

the terms of our senior secured credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

 

our senior secured credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests our senior secured credit facilities include a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum total leverage ratio 

 

as of december 31 2010 generac power systems was required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 575 to 100 under the first lien credit facility as of december 31 2010 generac power systems leverage ratio was 401 to 100 the maximum leverage ratio decreases over time the first lien credit facility requires generac power systems to have a leverage ratio of no greater than 575 to 100 in the first quarter of 2011 550 to 100 in the second quarter of 2011 525 to 100 in the third quarter of 2011 and 475 to 100 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and thereafter failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities unless waived by our lenders 

 

our senior secured credit facilities require us to use a portion of excess cash flow and proceeds of certain asset sales that are not reinvested in our business and other dispositions to repay indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 

 

our senior secured credit facilities also include covenants restricting among other things our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our senior secured credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facilities would result in a default under our senior secured credit facilities if any such default occurs the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings 

 

at september 30 2008 we failed to satisfy the leverage ratio in our senior secured credit facilities this default was cured by an equity contribution from affiliates of ccmp however ccmp and its affiliates are under no obligation to provide additional funds to us in the event of future covenant defaults 

 

our principal stockholder continues to have substantial control over us 

 

after giving effect to the ipo and underwriters option exercise occurring in 2010 affiliates of ccmp collectively beneficially own approximately 591 of our outstanding common stock as a consequence ccmp or its affiliates are able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and will control matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors a merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant transaction the interests of this stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders for instance this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price 

 

because affiliates of ccmp control more than 50 of the voting power of our common stock we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the nyses listed company manual under the nyses listed company manual a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain nyse corporate governance requirements including requirements that 1 a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and 3 director nominees be selected or recommended by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors because we have taken advantage of the controlled company exemption to certain nyse corporate governance requirements our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirements 

 

conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our principal stockholder 

 

representatives of ccmp and its affiliates occupy seats on our board of directors ccmp or its affiliates could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us or companies in which ccmp or its affiliates are currently invested may already compete with us as a result of these relationships when conflicts arise between the interests of ccmp or its affiliates and the interests of our stockholders these directors may not be disinterested the representatives of ccmp and its affiliates on our board of directors by the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “item 6  selected financial data” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those set forth under “item 1a  risk factors” 

  

overview 

we are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of standby generators for the residential industrial and commercial markets as the only significant market participant focused predominantly on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the standby generator market in the united states and canada we design engineer and manufacture generators with an output of between 800w and 9mw of power we design manufacture source and modify engines alternators automatic transfer switches and other components necessary for our products our generators are fueled by natural gas liquid propane gasoline diesel and bifuel™ our products are available through a broad network of independent dealers retailers and wholesalers 

business drivers and measures 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of industry trends performance measures and operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 

industry trends 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable backup power solutions by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important trends affecting our industry including the following 

increasing penetration opportunity although there have been recent increases in product costs for installed standby generators in the residential and lightcommercial markets driven in the last two years by raw material costs these costs have declined overall over the last decade and many potential customers are not aware of the costs and benefits of backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for residential products are approximately 2 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2007 american housing survey for the united states and penetration rates of many lightcommercial outlets such as restaurants drug stores and gas stations are significantly lower than penetration of hospitals and industrial locations we believe that by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators 

impact of residential investment cycle   the market for residential generators is affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer sentiment when homeowners are confident of their household income or net worth they are more likely to invest in their home these trends can have a material impact on demand for residential generators 

effect of large scale power disruptions power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators disruptions in the aging us power grid and tropical and winter storm activity increase product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months for standby generators while there are power outages every year across all regions of the country major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period 

impact of business capital investment cycle the market for commercial and industrial generators is affected by the capital investment cycle and overall durable goods spending as businesses either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations these trends can have a material impact on demand for industrial and commercial generators however the capital investment cycle may differ for the various industrial and commercial end markets industrial telecommunications distribution retail health care facilities and municipal infrastructure among others the market for generators is also affected by general economic conditions credit availability and trends in durable goods spending by consumers and businesses 

operational factors 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing and cost control the operational factors that affect our business include the following 

new product startup costs when we launch new products we generally experience an increase in startup costs including engineering expenses air freight expenses testing expenses and marketing expenses resulting in lower gross margins after the initial launch of a new product margins on new product introductions generally increase over the life of the product as these startup costs decline and we focus our engineering efforts on product cost reduction 

  

  

effect of commodity currency and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum and other components we use in our products together with foreign currency fluctuations can have a material impact on our results of operations we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of rising commodity currency and component prices through improved product design price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are borne by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 

other factors 

other factors that affect our results of operations include the following 

factors influencing interest and amortization expense as a result of the ccmp transactions in 2006 our interest expense and amortization expense increased accordingly our consolidated financial statements prior to november 2006 are not comparable to subsequent periods primarily as a result of significantly increased interest expense and amortization expense interest expense decreased in 2010 because we repaid 4343 million of outstanding indebtedness during 2010 interest rates declined from 2009 levels and certain interest rate swap contracts terminated at the beginning of 2010 

factors influencing provision for income taxes because we made a section 338h10 election in connection with the ccmp transactions we have 13 billion of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december 31 2010 that we expect to generate cash tax savings of 510 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability and a 385 tax rate   the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 47 million through 2020 and 39 million in 2021 assuming profitability and a 385 tax rate additionally we have federal net operating loss or nol carryforwards of 1661 million as of december 31 2010 which we expect to generate an additional 58 million of federal cash tax savings at a 35 rate when and if utilized   based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2021 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes however any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section 382 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 including through sales of stock by large stockholders all of which are outside of our control could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities 

 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past three years approximately 20 to 24 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 22 to 25 in the second quarter 25 to 29 in the third quarter and 26 to 30 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the timing of outage activity in each year we maintain a flexible production schedule in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand but typically increase production levels in the second and third quarters of each year 

transactions with ccmp 

in november 2006 affiliates of ccmp together with affiliates of unitas and members of our management purchased an aggregate of 689 million of our equity capital in addition on november 10 2006 generac power systems borrowed an aggregate of 1380 million consisting of an initial drawdown of 950 million under a 11 billion first lien secured credit facility and 430 million under a 430 million second lien secured credit facility with the proceeds from these equity and debt financings together with cash on hand at generac power systems we 1 acquired all of the capital stock of generac power systems and repaid certain pretransaction indebtedness of generac power systems for 20 billion 2 paid 66 million in transaction costs related to the transaction and 3 retained 3 million for general corporate purposes for additional information concerning these and other historical transactions with ccmp see “item 1—business—history—ccmp transactions”

as of september 30 2008 we failed to satisfy the leverage ratio in our senior secured credit facilities as permitted by the credit agreement in november 2008 this violation was remedied by an equity contribution of 15500000 from affiliates of ccmp in exchange for 1550 shares of series a preferred stock

in connection with such issuances of our class b common stock to affiliates of ccmp in connection with debt exchanges in 2007 and 2008 and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the shareholders agreement that arose from such issuances affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of our class b common stock they were issued in connection with such debt exchanges to an entity affiliated with ccmp certain affiliates of unitas and certain members of our management and board of directors in addition in connection with such issuances of our series a preferred stock to affiliates and ccmp in connection with debt exchanges in 2008 and 2009 and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the shareholders agreement that arose from such issuances during the year ended december 31 2009 we issued 2000 shares of series a preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of 200 million in cash to an entity affiliated with ccmp and certain members of management and our board of directors and affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of series a preferred stock they were previously issued in connection with such debt exchanges to an entity affiliated with ccmp and a member of the board of directors at the same price 

corporate reorganization 

our capitalization prior to the initial public offering consisted of series a preferred stock class b common stock and class a common stock our series a preferred stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a 14 annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares and equity participation equal to 243 of the remaining equity value of the company our class b common stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a 10 annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares in connection with the initial public offering we undertook a corporate reorganization which gave effect to the conversion of our series a preferred stock and class b common stock into the same class of our common stock that was sold in our initial public offering while taking into account the rights and preference of those shares including the priority returns of our series a preferred stock and our class b common stock and the equity participation rights of the series a preferred stock a reverse stock split was needed to reduce the number of shares to be issued to holders of our class a and class b common stock to the number that correctly reflected the proportionate interest of such stockholders in our company taking into account the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon the conversion of our series a preferred stock and the number and value of shares of common stock to be issued and sold to new investors in the initial public offering we refer to these transactions as the “corporate reorganization” the specific steps in the corporate reorganization were as follows 

treatment of class b common stock 

our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering provided for the mandatory conversion of our class b voting common stock to class a common stock in the event of an initial public offering so that our class b common stock is converted into the same class of our common stock that is to be offered in an initial public offering taking into account of the value rights and preferences of our class b common stock in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering at the time we entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the initial public offering each share of our class b common stock automatically converted into a number of shares of our class a common stock equal to one plus the quotient obtained by dividing ix the amount paid for such share of class b common stock plus y an increase to such amount equal to 10 per annum calculated and compounded quarterly on the basis of a 360day year of twelve 30day months and which increased amount shall be deemed to have accrued on a daily basis ie the “class b return” by ii the public offering price net of underwriting discounts and commissions we refer to this as the “class b conversion” each share of our class b common stock converted into 1118440 shares of our class a common stock ie the “class b conversion ratio” as a result of the class b conversion we issued an aggregate of 88484700 shares of our class a common stock 

  

reverse stock split 

immediately following the class b conversion we effected a 3294 for one reverse stock split of our then outstanding shares of class a common stock including those shares of our class a common stock issued as part of the class b conversion which decreased the number of shares of our class a common stock immediately after the class b conversion from 88490028 shares to 26861523 shares we refer to this as the “reverse stock split” 

treatment of series a preferred stock 

the certificate of designations for our series a preferred stock prior to our initial public offering provided for the mandatory conversion of the series a preferred stock to class a common stock in the event of an initial public offering so that our series a preferred stock is converted into the same class of our common stock that is to be offered in an initial public offering taking into account of the value rights and preferences of our series a preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designations to our series a preferred stock and our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering promptly following the time we entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the initial public offering each share of our series a preferred stock automatically converted into a number of shares of our class a common stock equal to the sum of a the quotient obtained by dividing iw the amount paid for such share of series a preferred stock plus x an increase to such amount equal to 14 per annum calculated and compounded quarterly on the basis of a 360day year of twelve 30day months and which increased amount shall be deemed to have accrued on a daily basis the “series a preferred return” by ii the public offering price net of underwriting discounts and commissions plus b the product of y a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of shares of our series a preferred stock outstanding at such time and z an additional number of shares of our class a common stock that when added to the number of shares of our class a common stock outstanding at such time including after giving effect to the class b conversion and the reverse stock split equaled 243 of the number of shares of our class a common stock outstanding at such time excluding the shares issued pursuant to clause a above we refer to this as the “series a preferred conversion” each share of our series a preferred stock converted into 1724976 shares of our class a common stock ie the “series a preferred conversion ratio” as a result of the series a preferred conversion we issued an aggregate of 19511018 shares of our class a common stock 

reclassification of class a common stock 

after giving effect to the class b conversion the reverse stock split and the series a preferred conversion there were 46372541 shares of class a common stock which were reclassified as common stock 

initial public offering 

on february 17 2010 the company completed its initial public offering of 18750000 shares of its common stock at a price of 1300 per share in addition the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 1950500 shares of the company’s common stock from the company on march 18 2010 we received a total of approximately 2479 million in net proceeds from the initial public offering and underwriters’ option exercise after deducting the underwriting discounts and expenses immediately following the corporate reorganization the ipo and underwriters’ option exercise we had 67529290 total shares of common stock outstanding 

repayment of debt 

in february 2010 we used 2216 million in net proceeds from the initial closing of the ipo to pay down our second lien term loan in full and to pay down a portion of our first lien term loan in addition in march 2010 and december 2010 we used 1385 million and 742 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents on hand to further pay down our first lien term loan as a result of these debt repayments the outstanding balance on the first lien credit facility has been reduced to 6572 million as of december 31 2010 and our second lien credit facility has been repaid in full and terminated this reduction in debt will have a significant impact on cash flows as a result of lower interest expense in future periods based on current libor rates 

  

  

components of net sales and expenses 

net sales 

substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our standby generators to the residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell aircooled engines to certain customers and sell service parts to our dealer network net sales are recognized upon shipment of products to our customers net sales also includes shipping and handling charges billed to customers which are recognized at the time of shipment of products to our customers related freight costs are included in cost of sales our generators are fueled by natural gas liquid propane gasoline diesel or bifuel™ systems with power output from 800w to 9mw our products are primarily manufactured and assembled at our wisconsin facilities and distributed through thousands of outlets across the united states and canada our smaller kw generators for the residential portable and commercial markets are typically built to stock while our larger kw products for the industrial markets are generally customized and built to order 

our net sales are affected primarily by the us economy as sales outside of north america represent only approximately 1 of total net sales 

we are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 6 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 and our top ten customers representing less than 29 of our net sales for the same period 

costs of goods sold 

the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised over 80 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2010   the principal component parts are engines and alternators we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our products smaller than 20kw we source engines for some of our smaller products and all of our products larger than 20kw we design all the alternators for our units and manufacture alternators for certain of our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable lowcost suppliers 

the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes and in the manufacturing of the components we source are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on product design improvements and price increases in our products however there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing facilities which require significant factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies and support and maintenance although we maintain a lowcost largely nonunion workforce and flexible manufacturing processes our margins can be impacted when we cannot promptly decrease labor and manufacturing costs to match declines in net sales 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our marketing distribution engineering information systems human resources finance purchasing risk management legal and tax functions all of these categories include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs and taxes we classify our operating expenses into four categories selling and service research and development general and administrative and amortization of intangibles 

selling and service our selling and service expenses consist primarily of personnel expense marketing expense warranty expense and other sales expenses our personnel expense recorded in selling and services expenses includes the expense of our sales force responsible for our national accounts and other personnel involved in the marketing and sales of our products warranty expense which is recorded at the time of sale is estimated based on historical trends our marketing expenses include direct mail costs printed material costs product display costs market research expenses trade show expenses and media advertising marketing expenses generally increase as our sales efforts increase and are related to the launch of new product offerings and opportunities within selected markets or associated with specific events such as awareness marketing in areas impacted by storms participation in trade shows and other events 

  

  

research and development our research and development expenses support over 120 active research and development projects we currently operate three advanced facilities and employ close to 120 engineers who focus on new product development existing product improvement and cost reduction our commitment to research and development has resulted in a significant portfolio of approximately 50 us and international patents and patent applications our research and development is expensed as incurred 

general and administrative our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for general and administrative employees accounting and legal professional services fees information technology costs insurance travel and entertainment expense and other corporate expense in 2010 our general and administrative expenses have increased as we have incurred additional expenses associated with being a public company including increased personnel costs legal costs accounting costs board compensation expense investor relations costs higher insurance premiums stockbased compensation expense and costs associated with our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other applicable sec regulations and the requirements of the nyse 

amortization of intangibles our amortization of intangibles expenses include the straightline amortization of customer lists patents and other intangibles assets 

goodwill and trade name impairment charges goodwill primarily represents the excess of the amount paid to acquire us over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired as of the november 2006 date of the ccmp transactions 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consist of trade names the fair value of trade names is measured using a relieffromroyalty approach which assumes the fair value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had we not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company 

in some periods we have recorded a charge for the write down of goodwill and trade names that was recorded in operating expenses please see “critical accounting policies—goodwill and other intangible assets” for additional detail on this charge 

transactionrelated expenses in the year ended december 31 2006 our operating expenses include onetime transactionrelated expenses incurred during the predecessor period related to the ccmp transactions 

other income expense 

our other income expense includes the interest expense on the outstanding balances of our 9500 million first lien term loan 4300 million second lien term loan and 1500 million revolving credit facility entered into in november 2006 and the amortization of debt financing costs in february 2010 we used the net proceeds from the initial closing of the initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loan in full and to pay down a portion of our first lien term loan in addition in march 2010 and december 2010 we used cash and cash equivalents on hand to further pay down our first lien term loan principal no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009   the amounts borrowed under our term loans bear interest at rates based upon either a base rate or libor plus an applicable margin we also earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents which is included in other income expense we also recorded expenses related to interest rate swap agreements which had a notional amount of 6750 million outstanding at december 31 2009 at an average rate of 504 and a notional amount of 3000 million outstanding at december 31 2010 at an average rate of 15 other income expense may also include other financial items such as extinguishment of debt 

  

 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 

 

 

net sales net sales increased 46 million or 08 to 5929 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 5882 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was driven by a 20 million or a 06 increase in sales to the residential markets due to continued expansion of the company’s distribution network and successful new product launches offset by continued weakness in us residential investment this residential product sales increase was offset by a 38 million or 20 decline in industrial and commercial product sales as a result of market declines in nonresidential construction and reduced capital spending by national account customers although a decrease for the full year industrial and commercial product sales displayed strong momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010 as end markets recovered other product sales increased 64 million as a result of stronger rv oem engine and service parts sales 

costs of goods sold costs of goods sold increased 31 million or 09 to 3555 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 3524 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was driven by a 44 million increase in materials cost primarily due to higher steel copper and aluminum costs as well as by the increase in sales volume partially offset by lower manufacturing overhead costs 

gross profit gross profit increased 15 million or 06 to 2374 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 2359 million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the factors affecting net sales and cost of goods sold described above as a percentage of net sales gross profit decreased slightly to 400 for the year ended december 31 2010 from 401 for the year ended december 31 2009 

operating expenses operating expenses increased 97 million to 1471 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 1373 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase is due to incremental research and development costs of 39 million related to ongoing product development in addition general and administrative expenses increased 79 million of which 64 million is related to noncash stock compensation expense recorded for the time vesting of equity awards granted in connection with the ipo the remaining increase in administrative costs is associated with additional costs to operate as a public company 

  

  

other expense other expense decreased 220 million or 400 to 331 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 551 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this decrease was driven by a decline in interest expense of 435 million as a result of our reduction in indebtedness lower libor rates and the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements offsetting this interest expense decline in 2010 there was a prior year gain on extinguishment of debt of 147 million that did not occur in 2010 as well as the current year writeoff of deferred financing costs related to debt extinguishment of 48 million 

income tax expense income tax expense was 03 million for the year ended december 31 2010 unchanged from the year ended december 31 2009 income tax expense primarily relates to certain state income taxes based on profitability measures other than net income 

net income as a result of the factors identified above we generated net income of 569 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to a net income of 431 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in net income is due to the items previously described 

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda decreased to 1562 million compared to 1591 million in 2009 as modest sales growth and consistent gross margins were more than offset by increased investment in the business adjusted ebitda margins declined slightly in fiscal 2010 to 264 compared to 270 in fiscal 2009 

adjusted net income adjusted net income increased to 1159 million in 2010 compared to 836 million in 2009 the increase in adjusted net income was attributable to lower interest expense versus prior year offset by non cash stock compensation expenses and reduced adjusted ebitda compared to fiscal 2009 

 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 

 

 

net sales net sales increased 140 million or 24 to 5882 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 5742 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase was driven by a 381 million or 115 increase in sales to the residential markets due to the introduction of our new automatic home standby generator products increases in our points of distribution our reentry into the small kilowatt portable generator market in may 2008 and a strong winter storm season in the beginning of 2009 partially offset by a weaker summer storm season during the third quarter of 2009 the increase in home standby and portable generators was partially offset by a 205 million or 99 decline in industrial and commercial sales as industrial national account and other customers lowered capital spending in late 2008 and 2009 net sales were also impacted by increased selling prices on certain residential commercial and industrial units 

  

  

costs of goods sold costs of goods sold decreased 198 million or 53 to 3524 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 3722 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this decrease was driven by a 133 million decrease in materials cost primarily due to lower steel copper and aluminum costs partially offset by the increase in sales volume freight costs and labor  overhead costs also decreased 33 million and 32 million respectively 

gross profit gross profit increased 338 million or 167 to 2359 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 2020 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the factors affecting net sales and cost of goods sold described above as a percentage of net sales gross profit increased to 401 for the year ended december 31 2009 from 352 for the year ended december 31 2008 gross profit margin increased as we realized the margin improvement from price increases commodity normalization and improved sourcing of certain components and products partially offset by higher sales of lower margin products 

operating expenses operating expenses decreased 5770 million to 1373 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 7143 million for the year ended december 31 2008 because of the goodwill and tradename impairment operating expenses were 5835 million higher for the year ended december 31 2008 the remaining increase in operating expenses of 65 million in 2009 was driven by an increase in amortization of intangibles of 44 million primarily due to the recharacterization of a particular trade name from indefinitelived to defined life the impairment of the particular trade name was a result of the implementation of our rebranding strategy whereby we consolidated brands under the generac label and have begun phasing out the particular trade name over time selling and service expenses also increased 24 million due to higher variable expenses related to our increase in net sales such as warranty commission and credit card fees as well as higher advertising costs research and development expenses increased 09 million from ongoing product development and engineering resource investment general and administrative expenses declined 12 million due to cost containment initiatives across the business 

other expense other expense increased 119 million or 274 to 551 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 433 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase was driven by a decrease in gains on the extinguishment of debt of 506 million partially offset by a decline in interest expense of 372 million as a result of our reduction in indebtedness and lower libor rates the gains on extinguishment of debt and the related decrease in interest expense are due to the debt repurchases by affiliates of ccmp which were subsequently contributed to our company in exchange for shares of our class b voting common stock and series a preferred stock 

income tax expense income tax expense was 03 million for the year ended december 31 2009 a decline of 01 million from 04 million for the year ended december 31 2008 income tax expense primarily relates to certain state income taxes based on profitability measures other than net income 

net income loss as a result of the factors identified above we generated net income of 431 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to a net loss of 5560 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in net income is due to the items previously described 

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda increased to 1591 million in 2009 compared to 1299 million in 2008 due to the increase in income from operations previously discussed excluding the impact of the goodwill and tradename impairment charge in 2008 which is excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda 

adjusted net income adjusted net income increased to 836 million in 2009 compared to 138 million in 2008 due to the increase in income from operations previously discussed excluding the impact of the goodwill and tradename impairment charge in 2008 which is excluded from the calculation of adjusted net income as well as the reduction in interest expense previously discussed 

liquidity and financial position 

our primary cash requirements include the payment of our raw material and components suppliers salaries  benefits operating expenses interest and principal payments on our debt and capital expenditures we finance our operations primarily through cash flow from operations and if necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility in november 2006 generac power systems entered into a sevenyear 9500 million first lien term loan a sevenandahalf year 4300 million second lien term loan and a sixyear 1500 million revolving credit facility on february 17 2010 we used approximately 2216 million of the net proceeds of our initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loans in full and to repay a portion of our first lien term loans in march 2010 and december 2010 we used a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents on hand to repay an additional 1385 million and 742 million respectively of our first lien term loan as a result of these pay downs the outstanding balance on the first lien credit facility has been reduced to 6572 million as of december 31 2010 and our second lien credit facility has been repaid in full and terminated 

  

  

at december 31 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of 786 million and 1457 million of availability under our revolving credit facility our total indebtedness was 6572 million at december 31 2010 

longterm liquidity 

we believe that our cash flow from operations our availability under our revolving credit facility combined with our low capital expenditure requirements and favorable tax attributes will provide us with sufficient capital to continue to grow our business in the next twelve months and beyond however even with our reduced leverage we will use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay interest on our outstanding debt limiting the amount available for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes as we continue to expand our business we may in the future require additional capital to fund working capital capital expenditures or acquisitions

the senior secured credit facility requires generac power systems to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated total debt net of unrestricted cash and marketable securities to ebitda as defined in the senior secured credit facility we refer to the calculation of ebitda under and as defined in our senior secured credit facility in this annual report as “covenant ebitda” covenant ebitda and the leverage ratio are calculated based on the four most recently completed fiscal quarters of generac power systems based on the formulations set forth in the first lien credit facility as of december 31 2010 generac power systems was required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 575 to 100 the maximum leverage ratio decreases over time the first lien credit facility required generac power systems to have a leverage ratio of no greater than 575 to 100 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and requires a leverage ratio of no greater than 575 to 100 in the first quarter of 2011 550 to 100 in the second quarter of 2011 525 to 100 in the third quarter of 2011 475 to 100 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and thereafter as of december 31 2010 generac power systems leverage ratio was 401 to 100   failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under our senior secured credit facility unless waived by our lenders as of september 30 2008 generac power systems had violated its leverage ratio covenant as permitted by the senior secured credit facilities this violation was remedied by an equity contribution of 153 million from affiliates of ccmp in the fourth quarter of 2008 generac power systems was in compliance with all of its covenants as of december 31 2008 december 31 2009 and december 31 2010 

the maximum leverage ratio is a material term of our senior secured credit facility in part because it is a maintenance covenant and our compliance with the covenant is used in determining among other things the interest rate of the first lien credit facility our ability to undertake business acquisitions our ability to incur certain types of indebtedness and the maximum amount of dividends and distributions that our senior secured credit facilities permit us to pay to our stockholders as described in more detail below 

the senior secured credit facility contains other events of default that are customary for similar facilities and transactions including a crossdefault provision with respect to any other indebtedness in an outstanding aggregate principal amount in excess of 250 million an event of default under the senior secured credit facility could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the facility and we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due if there were an event of default as a result of a failure to maintain our required leverage ratio or otherwise it would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity including preventing us from utilizing our revolving credit facility in addition the senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to take certain actions such as incur additional debt or make certain acquisitions if we are unable to meet our leverage ratio 

in addition to the financial covenant described above the senior secured credit facility contains certain other affirmative and negative covenants that among other things provide limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness liens on property sale and leaseback transactions investments loans and advances merger or consolidation asset sales acquisitions transactions with affiliates prepayments of any other indebtedness modifications of generac power systems organizational documents restrictions on generac power systems subsidiaries ability to make capital expenditures the ability to declare or pay dividends or make any other distributions with respect to any equity interests of generac power systems or to redeem purchase retire or otherwise acquire for value any equity interests of generac power systems is also restricted under the facility subject to certain exceptions including but not limited to dividends and distributions with the net proceeds of any issuance of qualified capital stock and a dollar basket which may be increased subject in the case of the dollar basket to compliance with a pro forma ratio of consolidated senior secured debt as defined in the senior secured credit facility which is net of unrestricted cash and marketable securities and excludes any indebtedness under the second lien credit facility to covenant ebitda not exceeding 300 to 100 under the more restrictive of the facilities and subject to the other restrictions set forth in the credit documents additionally the senior secured credit facility contains events of default that are customary for similar facilities and transactions including among others nonpayment breach of covenants other defaults change of control misrepresentations and a crossdefault provision with respect to any other indebtedness as of december 31 2010 generac power systems was in compliance with all covenants 

prior to our march 2010 debt prepayment the principal amount of the first lien term loan amortized in equal installments of 2375 million on the last date of each fiscal quarter through september 30 2013 with a final payment of 875081 million on november 10 2013 all scheduled quarterly amortizations prior to the final payment have been satisfied by our march 2010 prepayment of first lien debt of 1385 million any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due on november 10 2012 the principal amount of the second lien term loan facility was due on may 10 2014 but was paid in full on february 17 2010 with the proceeds from the ipo 

  

  

both the first lien and second lien credit facility grant generac power systems the option to prepay its borrowings under the term loans or the revolving credit facility subject to the procedures set forth in the credit documents in certain circumstances generac power systems may be required to make prepayments on its borrowings if it receives proceeds as a result of certain asset sales debt issuances casualty or similar events of loss or if generac power systems has excess cash flow as defined in the senior secured credit facilities 

as of december 31 2010 6572 million of borrowings were outstanding under the first lien term loan   as of december 31 2009 9107 million of borrowings were outstanding under the first lien term loan and 1808 million of borrowings were outstanding under the second lien term loan as previously disclosed on february 17 2010 we used approximately 2216 million of the net proceeds of our initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loans in full and to repay a portion of our first lien term loans in march 2010 and december 2010 we used a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents on hand to repay an additional 1385 million and 742 million respectively of our first lien term loan 

 

contractual obligations 

 

 

capital expenditures 

our operations require capital expenditures for technology tooling equipment capacity expansion and upgrades capital expenditures were 96 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and were funded through cash from operations capital expenditures were 45 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and were funded through cash from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for selected dealers this arrangement provides liquidity for our dealers by financing dealer purchases of products with credit availability from the finance company we receive payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer and our dealers are given a longer period of time to pay the finance provider if our dealers do not pay the finance company we may be required to repurchase the applicable inventory held by the dealer 

total inventory financed accounted for approximately 4 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 and approximately 7 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 the amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding was 74 million and 98 million as of december 31 2009 and 2010 respectively 

 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company including information about contingencies risk and financial condition the company believes given current facts and circumstances that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to accounting principles generally accepted in the us and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property plant and equipment and prepaid expenses management believes the company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment defined benefit pension obligations estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty other contingencies derivative accounting income taxes and share based compensation 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and trade names and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a twostep process the first step is the estimation of fair value of the applicable reporting unit we have determined we have one reporting unit and all significant decisions are made on a companywide basis by our chief operating decision maker estimated fair value is based on management judgments and assumptions with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm and those fair values are compared with our aggregate carrying value if our fair value is greater than the carrying amount there is no impairment if our carrying amount is greater than the fair value then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment if any 

the second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill which is compared to its carrying value the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit at the hypothetical fair value assuming the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of the entire reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 

as of october 31 2008 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test our fair value was estimated based on a weighted analysis of discounted cash flows and comparable public company analysis ie market approach the rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk where appropriate in determining the estimated future cash flows current and future levels of income are considered as well as business trends and market conditions due to an increase in the our weighted average cost of capital and lower comparable public company market values resulting from weakening economic conditions the analysis indicated the potential for impairment 

we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment evaluation with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm and determined an impairment of goodwill existed accordingly a noncash charge of 5032 million was recognized in 2008 for goodwill impairment 

we performed our annual fair valuebased impairment test on trade names as of october 31 2008 as a result of the test we recorded a noncash charge of 803 million for trade name impairment the primary reason for this impairment charge related to a rebranding strategy which was committed to in the fourth quarter of 2008 and resulted in our plan to discontinue use of the guardian® trade name over time as we consolidate brands under the generac label accordingly this particular trade name was written down to its estimated realizable value of 87 million which will be amortized over its remaining useful life of two years 

as of october 31 2009 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test which indicated a premium over net book value of 71 the testing determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time in addition we performed our annual fair valuebased impairment test on trade names as of october 31 2009 the testing determined that there was no impairment of our trade names at that time 

as of october 31 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test which indicated a premium over net book value of 115 the testing determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time in addition we performed our annual fair valuebased impairment test on trade names as of october 31 2010 the testing determined that there was no impairment of our trade names at that time 

we can make no assurances that remaining goodwill or trade names will not be impaired in the future when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year additionally since our measurement also considers a market approach changes in comparable public company multiples can also materially impact our impairment analysis 

  

  

in the long term our remaining goodwill and trade name balances could be further impaired in future periods a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue operating costs and other relevant factors if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our business may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

defined benefit pension obligations 

the funded status of our pension plans is more fully described in note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report as discussed in note 9 the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2010 used a discount rate of 572 and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 730 our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moodys aa or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations given this policy we expect to make 20 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2011 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty reserves and other contingencies 

the reserves if any for customer rebates product warranty product liability litigation excess and obsolete inventory and doubtful accounts are factspecific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations historical experience and current and expected economic conditions these reserves are reflected under notes 2 3 4 and 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report 

  

  

derivative accounting 

we have interest rate swap contracts or the swaps in place to fix a portion of our variable rate indebtedness for 2007 and 2008 the swaps were deemed highly effective per asc 815 formerly sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and therefore any changes in fair value of these swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss   as of january 3 2009 in accordance with the terms of our senior secured credit facilities we changed the interest rate election from threemonth libor to onemonth libor as a result we concluded that as of january 3 2009 the swaps no longer met hedge effectiveness criteria under sfas no 133 future changes in the fair value of the swaps was immediately recognized in our statement of operations as interest expense while the effective portion of the swaps prior to the change remained in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and was amortized as interest expense over the period of the originally designated hedged transactions which ended on january 4 2010 new interest rate swap contracts entered into in fiscal 2010 are deemed highly effective per asc 815 

as required by asc 815 derivatives and hedging we record the swaps at fair value pursuant to asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value when determining the fair value of the swaps we considered our credit risk in accordance with asc 820 the fair value of the swaps including the impact of credit risk at december 31 2009 and 2010 was a liability of 00 million and 41 million respectively 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 

we have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences as well as significant net operating loss carryforwards in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment however the company is currently in a three year cumulative net loss position due primarily to a goodwill and tradename impairment writeoff in 2008 and therefore has not considered expected future taxable income in analyzing the realizability of the deferred tax assets as of december 31 2010 as a result of this analysis we have recorded a full valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets 

share based compensation 

under the fair value recognition provisions of asc 718 compensation – stock compensation  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends and market volatility of our stock in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 

new accounting standards 

there are currently no significant new accounting standards to be adopted by the company 

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates to reduce the risk from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we use financial instruments from time to time we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign currency 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of purchasing from suppliers in other countries periodically we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases in the normal course of business contracts typically have maturities of one year or less realized and unrealized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 

on february 18 2010 we entered into a tenmonth foreign currency average rate option transaction for euros with a total notional amount of 25 million and a termination date of december 31 2010 total losses recognized in the statement of operations for foreign currency contracts were 100000 the primary objective of this hedging activity is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of the euro on our financial results 

commodity prices 

we are a purchaser of commodities and of components manufactured from commodities including steel aluminum copper and others as a result we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process depending on the supplier these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 

periodically we engage in certain commodity risk management activities the primary objectives of these activities are to understand and mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results generally these risk management transactions will involve the use of commodity derivatives to protect against exposure resulting from significant price fluctuations 

we primarily utilize commodity contracts with maturities of one year or less these are intended to offset the effect of price fluctuations on actual inventory purchases at december 31 2009 there was one outstanding commodity contract in place to hedge our projected commodity purchases total gains recognized in the statements of operations on commodity contracts were 387000 for the year ended december 31 2009 on november 16 2010 we entered into a fourmonth commodity hedge transaction for copper with a total notional amount of 23 million with an effective date of january 1 2011 the primary objective of the hedge is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of copper on our financial results at december 31 2010 this contract was the only outstanding commodity contract in place to hedge our projected commodity purchases total gains recognized in the statements of operations on commodity contracts were 1056000 for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2010 a portion of the outstanding debt under our term loans was subject to floating interest rate risk we previously entered into interest rate swaps with certain banks the notional amount of these swaps was 6750 million as of december 31 2009   these swaps expired on january 4 2010 we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with a certain bank on january 21 2010 the effective date of the swap was july 1 2010 with a notional amount of 200000000 a fixed rate of 173 and an expiration date of july 1 2012 on june 29 2010 we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement with a certain bank the effective date of the swap was october 1 2010 with a notional amount of 100000000 a fixed rate of 1025 and an expiration date of october 1 2012 at december 31 2010 the fair value of the swaps reduced for our credit risk and excluding related accrued interest was a liability of 41 million   for further information on these swaps see note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report even after giving effect to these swaps we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our term loans that are not covered by these swaps a hypothetical change in the libor interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed annual cash interest expense by approximately 36 million or without the swaps in place 66 million 

we expect to maintain our existing swaps as highly effective in accordance with asc 815 formerly sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and therefore any changes in the fair value of the swap would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss

distribution channels and customers 

we distribute our product through several channels to increase awareness of our product categories and the generac® brand and to ensure our products reach a broad customer base this distribution network includes independent residential and industrial dealers electrical wholesalers national accounts private label arrangements retailers catalogs and ecommerce merchants we believe our distribution network is a competitive advantage that we have strengthened over the last decade by 

expanding our network from our base of industrial dealers to include other channels of distribution as we have increased our product offerings our network is well balanced with no single sales channel providing more than 24 of our sales and no customer providing more than 8 of our sales in 2009 

our dealer network which is located principally in the united states and canada is the industrys largest network of independent generator contractors 

our residential dealer network sells installs and services our residential and commercial products to end users we have developed a number of proprietary dealer management systems to evaluate manage and incentivize our dealers which we believe has improved the level of customer service provided to end customers these systems include both technical and sales training programs under which we train new and existing dealers about our products service and installation we regularly perform market analyses to determine if a given market is either underserved or has poor independent distributor representation within these locations we selectively add distribution or invest resources in existing dealer support and training to improve dealer performance 

our industrial dealer network provides industrial and commercial endusers with ongoing local and nationwide product support our sales group works in conjunction with our industrial dealers to ensure that national accounts receive engineering support competitive pricing and nationwide service we promote our industrial generators through the use of traveling demonstrations specifying engineer education events dealer forums and training events in recent years we have been particularly focused on expanding our industrial dealer network in canada and latin america in order to expand our international sales opportunities 

our electrical wholesaler network consists of selling branches of both national and local distribution houses our electrical wholesalers distribute our residential lightcommercial and industrial generators and are a key introduction to the standby generator category for electrical contractors who may not be generac dealers 

on a selective basis we have established arrangements with private label partners to provide residential lightcommercial and industrial generators the partners include leading hvac equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies each of which provides access to incremental channels of distribution for our products we have multiyear contracts with certain of these partners with terms of between three and four years establishing the terms of these arrangements 

our retail distribution network includes thousands of locations which includes regional and national home improvement chains retailers clubs buying groups and farm supply stores this is supplemented with a number of catalogue and ecommerce retailers this network sells our residential standby portable and lightcommercial generators in some cases we have worked with our retail partners to create installation programs using our dealers to support the sale and installation of standby generator products sold at retail we also use a combination of advertising through our partners and other national retail accounts to promote our products within the network 

we also sell generators and aircooled engines directly to oem manufacturers and aftermarket dealers for use in the rv and lawn and garden industries 

manufacturing 

our excellence in manufacturing reflects our philosophy of high standards continuous improvement and commitment to quality our facilities showcase our advanced manufacturing techniques and demonstrate the effectiveness of lean manufacturing 

we are focused on lowcost production techniques and technology and continually seek to reduce manufacturing costs while improving product quality we deliver an affordable product to our customers through our lowcost design philosophy our foreign sourcing strategy our scale and 

adherence to lean manufacturing principles we believe we have sufficient capacity to achieve our business goals for the foreseeable future without the need for significant expansion 

our product quality is essential to maintaining a leading market position incoming shipments from our suppliers are tested to ensure engineering specifications are met purchased components are tested for quality at the suppliers factory and before entering production lines and are continuously tested throughout the manufacturing process internal product and production audits are performed to ensure a quality product and process we test finished products under a variety of simulated conditions at each of our manufacturing facilities 

research and development and intellectual property 

our primary focus on generators drives technological innovation specialized engineering and manufacturing competencies research and development is a core competency and includes a staff of over 100 engineers working on numerous active projects our sponsored research and development expense was 96 million 99 million and 108 million for the years ended december 2007 2008 and 2009 research and development is conducted at each of our manufacturing facilities and additionally at our technical center in suzhou china with dedicated teams for each product line research and development is focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements as well as maintaining product competitiveness by improving manufacturing costs safety characteristics reliability and performance while ensuring compliance with governmental standards we have had over 30 years of experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology in the residential market we have developed proprietary engines cooling packages controls and fuel and emissions systems 

we rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights our commitment to research and development has resulted in a portfolio of approximately 50 us and international patents and patent applications our patents expire between june 2012 and january 2027 and protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems air flow electronics and controls noise reduction and aircooled engines us trademark registrations generally have a perpetual duration if they are properly maintained and renewed new us patents that are issued generally have a life of 20 years from the date the patent application is initially filed we believe the existence of these patents and trademarks along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position we also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment 

suppliers of raw materials 

our primary raw material inputs are steel copper and aluminum all of which are purchased from third parties and in many cases as part of machined or manufactured components we have developed an extensive network of reliable lowcost suppliers in the united states and abroad in 2009 we sourced more than half of our components from outside the united states 

competition 

the market for onsite generators is competitive we face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers abroad however most of the traditional participants in the standby generator market compete on a more specialized basis focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix we are the only significant market participant focused exclusively on standby and portable generators with broad capabilities across the residential industrial and lightcommercial generator markets we believe that our engineering 

capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a firstmover advantage over our competition for product innovation 

our competitors include briggs  stratton caterpillar cummins honda kohler mtu katolight division and techtronics international tti in the market for standby industrial and commercial generators our primary competitors are caterpillar cummins kohler and mtu most of which focus on the market for diesel generators as they are also diesel engine manufacturers in the market for residential standby generators our primary competitors include briggs  stratton cummins onan division and kohler which also have broad operations in other manufacturing businesses in the portable generator market our primary competitors include briggs  stratton honda and techtronics international tti along with a number of smaller domestic and foreign competitors 

there are a number of other standby generator manufacturers located outside north america but most supply their products mainly to their respective regional markets in a continuously evolving sector we believe our size and broad capabilities make us well positioned to remain competitive furthermore we view several of these international manufacturers as potential candidates for future strategic partnerships 

we compete primarily on the basis of brand reputation quality reliability pricing innovative features breadth of product and product availability 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had 1354 employees 1293 full time and 61 parttime and temporary employees of those 738 employees were directly involved in manufacturing at our manufacturing facilities 

we have had an open shop bargaining agreement for the past 45 years our current agreement is with the communication workers of america local 5503 the current agreement which expires october 14 2011 covers our waukesha and eagle facilities currently 2 of our workforce is a member of a labor union our facility in whitewater wisconsin is not unionized 

regulation including environmental matters 

as a manufacturing company our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition our products are subject to various laws and regulations relating to among other things emissions and fuel requirements as well as labeling and marketing 

our products are regulated by the epa and carb these governing bodies continuously pass regulations that require us to meet more stringent emission standards with the adoption of a recent regulation covering stationary propane and natural gasfueled generators the epa now regulates all products we produce for sale in the united states new regulations could require us to redesign our products and could affect market growth for our products for example the epa has developed multiple phases of national emission standards for small aircooled engines in 2008 the epa adopted a proposed phase iii regulation that further reduces permitted exhaust emissions from small engines and also requires the engines and equipment in which engines are used to meet new evaporative emission standards the epas phase iii program requires the use of evaporative controls that must be phased in starting in 2009 and take full effect in 2011 for class ii engines 225 cubic center displacement and larger and 2012 for class i engines less than 225 cubic center displacement the phase iii programs more stringent exhaust emission requirements also apply starting in 2011 for class ii engines and 2012 for class i engines the phase iii standards are similar to the carbs 

tier 3 emission standards which were fully phased in during fiscal year 2008 carbs tier 3 regulation required additional reductions to engine exhaust emissions as well as new controls on evaporative emissions from small engines 

we believe that our operations and our products are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations including environmental and workplace safety regulations we are not subject to any pending investigations claims or proceedings by any foreign federal state or local governmental agency or administration that would materially impact our financial condition or our results

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the following risks these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include but are not limited to the factors mentioned under forwardlooking statements and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this report 

risk factors related to our business and industry 

demand for our products is significantly affected by unpredictable major poweroutage events that can lead to substantial variations in and uncertainties regarding our financial results from period to period 

sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns and demand for our products is affected by outage events including thunderstorms hurricanes ice storms and blackouts caused by grid reliability issues sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales and excess inventory for example in 2007 our net sales declined significantly from the prior year which was driven in part by the fact that the storm seasons in the two years leading up to and including 

2007 resulted in fewer power outages than in the prior years the lack of major poweroutage events can affect our net sales in the quarters following a given storm season unpredictable fluctuations in demand are therefore part of managing our business and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits 

demand for our standby generators is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses and other macroeconomic conditions 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the recent downturn in worldwide economic conditions and the impact of the credit crisis could lead to a significant decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices our sales of lightcommercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the nonresidential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities for example lower capital spending by our industrial national accounts and other industrial and commercial customers caused a 99 decline in net sales to the industrial and commercial market in the year ended december 31 2009 if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the lightcommercial and industrial sectors through among other things our focus on innovation and product development including natural gas engine technology could be adversely affected in addition consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business typically we do not have contracts with our customers and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen or if the nonresidential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to continue to decline our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected 

decreases in the availability or increases in the cost of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 

the principal raw materials that we use to produce our generators are steel copper and aluminum we also source a significant number of component parts that we utilize to manufacture our generators from third parties the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand transportation costs government regulations and tariffs price controls economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we do not have longterm supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements price increases to our customers or hedging transactions our profitability could be adversely affected for example in 2008 we experienced a 48 decrease in gross margin percentage partially due to increases in commodity prices including steel copper and aluminum also our ability to continue to obtain materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers including in some cases suppliers who are the sole source of important components if we are unable to obtain adequate cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis this could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 

the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies and have substantially greater financial resources some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us in addition we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter the generator market demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality to respond to downward pricing pressure and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures we could lose market share which could have an adverse impact on our results for more information see item 1—business—competition 

our industry is subject to technological change and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 

new products or refinements and improvements of existing products may have technical failures their introduction may be delayed they may have higher production costs than originally expected or they may not be accepted by our customers if we are not able to anticipate identify develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label telecommunications or retail customers would adversely affect our business 

in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands in addition we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading hvac equipment electrical equipment and construction machinery companies arrangements with top retailers and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large telecommunications retail and other customers are typically not exclusive and many of the distributors and customers with whom we do business offer products and services of our competitors impairment of our relationships with our distributors dealers or large customers loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits also our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 

our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 

we view our intellectual property rights including those relating to our generac® brand name fuel management systems and mps technology as important assets we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization breaching any confidentiality 

agreements with us copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business if it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail we cannot guarantee that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 

in addition we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights any such claim even if it is without merit may be expensive and timeconsuming to defend subject us to damages cause us to cease making using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property require us to redesign our products divert management time and attention andor require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements furthermore in connection with our sale of generac portable products to the beacon group in 1998 we granted the beacon group an exclusive perpetual license for the use of the generac portable products trademark in connection with the manufacture and sale of certain engine driven consumer products this perpetual license was eventually transferred to briggs and stratton briggs when the beacon group sold that business to briggs currently this trademark is not being used in commerce however in the event that the beacon group or briggs use this trademark in the future we could suffer competitive confusion and our business could be negatively impacted 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations and noncompliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines sanctions and claims 

our operations are subject to a variety of foreign federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing among other things emissions to air discharges to water noise the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials in addition under federal and state environmental laws we could be required to investigate remediate andor monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at thirdparty sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused or had any knowledge of the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing among other things emissions and noise including standards imposed by the federal environmental protection agency or epa state regulatory agencies such as the california air resources board or carb and other regulatory agencies around the world these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent changes in applicable laws or regulations or in the enforcement thereof could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to modify our projects or develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example we were required to modify our natural gas and liquid propanefueled liquidcooled engines and generators by january 1 2009 to comply with emissions standards in the united states while we have been able to meet previous deadlines failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 

we may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 

we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed if our reputation is damaged we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products which could reduce our sales and profitability 

the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

our success depends in part on the efforts of certain key individuals including the members of our senior management team who have significant experience in the generator industry if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if our key employees leave our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity and results of operations although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could harm our business 

currently 2 of our workforce is a member of a labor union in addition we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in loss of business in addition union activity could result in higher labor costs which could harm our financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 

while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand reduce our sales andor negatively impact our financial results any of our manufacturing facilities or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events including 

• equipment or information technology infrastructure failure • disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including roads bridges railroad tracks • fires floods earthquakes or other catastrophes and • other operational problems in addition all of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a 30mile radius we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin in the event of a business interruption 

at our wisconsin facilities we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs among other severe consequences such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 

a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 

we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas primarily in asia our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with thirdparty sourcing generally such risks include 

• inflation or changes in political and economic conditions • unstable regulatory environments • changes in import and export duties • domestic and foreign customs and tariffs • currency rate fluctuations • trade restrictions • labor unrest • logistical and communications challenges and • other restraints and burdensome taxes these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to source our purchased components overseas in particular if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers our cost of goods sold could increase materially which would adversely affect our results of operations 

as a us corporation that sources components in foreign countries we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act a determination that we violated this act may affect our business and operations adversely 

as a us corporation we are subject to the regulations imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

we have significant tax assets usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 1618 million of net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section 382 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 including through sales of stock by large stockholders all of which are out of our control could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities 

our total assets include goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles if we determine these have become impaired in the future net income could be materially adversely affected 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations indefinitelived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names at december 31 2009 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangibles totaled 6659 million most of which arose from the ccmp transactions we review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations a reduction in net income resulting from the writedown or impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for example in october 2008 due to an increase in our weighted average cost of capital and lower comparable public company market values resulting from weakening economic conditions we determined that an impairment of goodwill existed and recorded a noncash charge of 5032 million in 2008 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with fasb asc accounting standards codification topic 35020 goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment and definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable future impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of the acquired business or product line adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business or product line and a variety of other circumstances the amount of any impairment is recorded as a charge to the statement of operations we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets any future determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of intangible assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for details 

we may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all which may limit our ability to grow 

we may require additional financing to expand our business financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt in addition economic conditions including any further downturn or crisis in the credit markets could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms we may have to delay modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies our revolving credit facility matures in november 2012 and our first lien term loan facility matures in november 2013 if we are unable to refinance these facilities on acceptable terms our liquidity could be adversely affected 

we are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes of our products on our net sales 

because of the wide range of products that we sell the level of customization for many of our products the frequent rollout of new products and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales 

risks related to our common stock 

we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock we intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of outstanding debt in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be stockholders sole source of gain for the foreseeable future while we may change this policy at some point in the future we cannot assure stockholders that we will make such a change see item 5—market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—dividends 

future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 

if our stockholders prior to the initial public offering sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market the market price of our common stock could decline these sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell additional equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate as of march 29 2010 we have 67529290 shares of our common stock outstanding 

subject to lockup agreements entered into in connection with our initial public offering 46372541 restricted securities may be sold into the public market in the future without registration under the securities act to the extent permitted under rule 144 all of these restricted securities will be eligible for sale under rule 144 following expiration of the lockup agreements described above subject to limitations on sales by affiliates in addition commencing 180 days after the date of our initial public offering ie august 9 2010 certain stockholders holding 45509752 outstanding shares of these restricted securities will have registration rights which could allow those holders to sell their shares freely through a future registration statement filed under the securities act 

in addition we filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities act to register an aggregate of 6637835 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our omnibus plan including an aggregate of 4797753 shares that were granted as nonvested restricted stock shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and shares granted to directors in connection with our initial public offering we may increase the number of shares registered for this purpose at any time subject to any restrictions imposed on the restricted shares and options granted under our omnibus plan shares registered under the registration statement on form s8 will be available for sale into the public markets subject to the 180day lockup agreements referred to above 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our common stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline and such decline could be material 

as a public company we are required to meet periodic reporting requirements under the securities and exchange commission or sec rules and regulations complying with federal securities laws as a public company is expensive and we will incur significant time and expense enhancing documenting testing and certifying our internal control over financial reporting any deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock 

sec rules require that as a publiclytraded company we file periodic reports containing our financial statements within a specified time following the completion of quarterly and annual periods prior to our initial public offering we had not been required to comply with sec requirements to have our financial statements completed and reviewed or audited within a specified time and as such we may experience difficulty in meeting the secs reporting requirements any failure by us to file our periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner could harm our reputation and reduce the trading price of our common stock 

as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting insurance and other expenses the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as compliance with other rules of the sec and the new york stock exchange or nyse will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly furthermore sec rules require that our chief executive officer and chief financial officer periodically certify the existence and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm will be required beginning with our annual report on form 10k for our fiscal year ending on december 31 2010 to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting this process which we have not undertaken in the past will require significant documentation of policies procedures and systems review of that documentation by our internal accounting staff and our outside auditors and testing of our internal control over financial reporting by our internal accounting staff this process will involve considerable time and expense may strain our internal resources and have an adverse impact on our operating costs we may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses and outside auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter 

during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies that would have to be remediated to satisfy the sec rules for certification of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as a consequence we may have to disclose in periodic reports we file with the sec material weaknesses in our system of internal controls the existence of a material weakness would preclude management from concluding that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and would preclude our independent auditors from issuing an unqualified opinion that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in addition disclosures of this type in our sec reports could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and may negatively affect the trading price of our common stock moreover effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting it may negatively impact our business results of operations and reputation 

antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit a change of control that our stockholders may favor and could negatively affect our stock price 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock these provisions may also 

prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

• permit our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as they determine without stockholder approval • provide that only onethird of the members of the board are elected at each stockholders meeting and prohibit removal without cause • require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations and • contain limitations on convening stockholder meetings these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

risks related to our capital structure 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2009 we had total indebtedness of 10915 million while we reduced this amount of debt after december 31 2009 through the use of the proceeds of our ipo and of cash on hand as discussed elsewhere in this report under item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we still have a substantial amount of indebtedness after the repayment of debt using the proceeds of the ipo and available cash onhand we had total indebtedness of 7314 million as of march 19 2010 our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness combined with our lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences for example it could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness including financial and other restrictive covenants which could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness • make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation • require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes • limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and • limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements execution of our business strategy or other purposes any of the abovelisted factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows furthermore our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our senior secured credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 

the terms of our senior secured credit facilities restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facilities contain and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best longterm interests our senior secured credit facilities include a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum total leverage ratio 

as of december 31 2009 generac power systems was required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 675 to 100 and 700 to 100 under the first and second lien credit facilities respectively as of december 31 2009 generac power systems leverage ratio was 599 to 100 prior to giving effect to the reduction of debt through the use of proceeds of our ipo and application of cash on hand each of which took place after december 31 2009 and are discussed in this report under item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations after giving effect to the reduction of debt using the proceeds from the ipo and available cash onhand generac power systems leverage ratio was 459 pro forma as of december 31 2009 the maximum leverage ratio decreases over time under both facilities the more restrictive of the facilities is the first lien credit facility which requires generac power systems to have a leverage ratio of no greater than 675 to 100 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and in the first quarter of 2010 650 to 100 in the second quarter of 2010 625 to 100 in the third quarter of 2010 575 to 100 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 550 to 100 in the second quarter of 2011 525 to 100 in the third quarter of 2011 and 475 to 100 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and thereafter failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities unless waived by our lenders 

our senior secured credit facilities require us to use a portion of excess cash flow and proceeds of certain asset sales that are not reinvested in our business and other dispositions to repay indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 

our senior secured credit facilities also include covenants restricting among other things our ability to 

• incur liens • incur or assume additional debt or guarantees or issue preferred stock • pay dividends or make redemptions and repurchases with respect to capital stock • prepay or make redemptions and repurchases of subordinated debt • make loans and investments • make capital expenditures • engage in mergers acquisitions asset sales saleleaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates • change the business conducted by us or our subsidiaries and • amend the terms of subordinated debt the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our senior secured credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facilities would result in a default under our senior secured credit facilities if any such default occurs the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or enforce their security interest any of which would result in an event of default the lenders 

will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings 

at september 30 2008 we failed to satisfy the leverage ratio in our senior secured credit facilities this default was cured by an equity contribution from affiliates of ccmp however ccmp and its affiliates are under no obligation to provide additional funds to us in the event of future covenant defaults 

our principal stockholder continues to have substantial control over us 

as of march 18 2010 after giving effect to the ipo and underwriters option exercise affiliates of ccmp collectively beneficially own approximately 584 and affiliates of unitas collectively beneficially own approximately 43 of our outstanding common stock as a consequence ccmp or its affiliates are able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and will control matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors a merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant transaction the interests of this stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders for instance this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price 

because affiliates of ccmp control more than 50 of the voting power of our common stock we are a controlled company within the meaning of the nyses listed company manual under the nyses listed company manual a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain nyse corporate governance requirements including requirements that 1 a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors 2 compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and 3 director nominees be selected or recommended by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors because we have taken advantage of the controlled company exemption to certain nyse corporate governance requirements our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirements 

conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our principal stockholder 

representatives of ccmp and its affiliates occupy a majority of the seats on our board of directors ccmp or its affiliates could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us or companies in which ccmp or its affiliates are currently invested may already compete with us as a result of these relationships when conflicts arise between the interests of ccmp or its affiliates and the interests of our stockholders these directors may not be disinterested the representatives of ccmp and its affiliates on our board of directors by the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors

none 

recent sales of unregistered securities 

in september 2009 we sold 2000 shares of our series a preferred stock to certain stockholders for an aggregate purchase price of 200 million the september 2009 issuance of series a preferred stock was the consummation of a contractual preemptive right exercised in september 2009 that was triggered by our sales of shares to affiliates of ccmp beginning in late 2008 and ending in july 2009 each of the purchasers of these shares of series a preferred stock had a preexisting relationship with us as a stockholder and in many cases also as an employee and had a contractual right to acquire such shares pursuant to the shareholders agreement entered into at the time of the ccmp transaction in 2006 the offering and sale of these shares of preferred stock did not involve any solicitation beyond the parties to the shareholders agreement each of these transactions was exempt from registration pursuant to section 42 of the securities act as it was a transaction by an issuer that did not involve a public offering of securities there were no underwriters employed in connection with the transaction and the recipients of securities in the transaction represented their intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to any distribution thereof appropriate legends were affixed to the share certificates and other instruments issued in the transaction all purchasers were given the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from our representatives concerning our business and financial affairs each of the purchasers that were employees of the registrant had access to such information through their employment with the registrant based on the foregoing and the fact that the transaction giving rise to the exercise of the preemptive right as well as the exercise of preemptive rights themselves took place well in advance and was independent of the filing of the registration statement for our initial public offering we concluded that these transactions were exempt from registration 

use of proceeds from registered securities 

on february 17 2010 we completed our initial public offering of 18750000 shares of our common stock at a price of 1300 per share the shares were registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended on a registration statement on form s1 registration no 333 162590 the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on february 10 2010 jp morgan securities inc goldman sachs  co bofa merrill lynch and robert w baird  co incorporated served as joint book running managers for the initial public offering

on march 18 2010 the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 1950500 shares of our common stock from us net proceeds received from the option exercise were 238 million and are to be used for general corporate purposes including debt repayment 




 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with item 6—selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those set forth under item 1a—risk factors 

overview 

we are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of standby generators for the residential industrial and commercial markets as the only significant market participant focused exclusively on these products we have one of the leading market positions in the standby generator market in the united states and canada we design engineer and manufacture generators with an output of between 800w and 9mw of power we design manufacture source and modify engines alternators automatic transfer switches and other components necessary for our products our generators are fueled by natural gas liquid propane gasoline diesel and bifuel™ our products are available through a broad network of independent dealers retailers and wholesalers 

business drivers and measures 

in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to a number of industry trends performance measures and operational factors the statements in this section are based on our current expectations 

industry trends 

our performance is affected by the demand for reliable backup power solutions by our customer base this demand is influenced by several important trends affecting our industry including the following 

increasing penetration opportunity although there have been recent increases in product costs for installed standby generators in the residential and lightcommercial markets driven in the last two years by raw material costs these costs have declined overall over the last decade and many potential customers are not aware of the costs and benefits of backup power solutions we estimate that penetration rates for residential products are approximately 2 of us singlefamily detached owneroccupied households with a home value of over 100000 as defined by the us census bureaus 2007 american housing survey for the united states and penetration rates of many lightcommercial outlets such as restaurants drug stores and gas stations are significantly lower than penetration of hospitals and industrial locations we believe that by expanding our distribution network continuing to develop our product line and targeting our marketing efforts we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators 

effect of large scale power disruptions power disruptions are an important driver of consumer awareness and have historically influenced demand for generators disruptions in the aging us power grid and tropical and winter storm activity increase product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period which we believe may last for six to twelve months for standby generators while there are power outages every year across all regions of the country major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and as a result our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period 

impact of business capital investment cycle the market for commercial and industrial generators is affected by the capital investment cycle and overall durable goods spending as businesses either add 

new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations these trends can have a material impact on demand for industrial and commercial generators however the capital investment cycle may differ for the various industrial and commercial end markets industrial telecommunications distribution retail health care facilities and municipal infrastructure among others the market for generators is also affected by general economic conditions credit availability and trends in durable goods spending by consumers and businesses 

operational factors 

we are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control including continued product development expanded distribution pricing and cost control the operational factors that affect our business include the following 

new product startup costs when we launch new products we generally experience an increase in startup costs including engineering expenses air freight expenses testing expenses and marketing expenses resulting in lower gross margins after the initial launch of a new product margins on new product introductions generally increase over the life of the product as these startup costs decline and we focus our engineering efforts on product cost reduction 

effect of commodity and component price fluctuations industrywide price fluctuations of key commodities such as steel copper and aluminum and other components we use in our products can have a material impact on our results of operations we have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of commodity and component prices through improved product design price increases and select hedging transactions our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates which in some cases are borne by our customers and in other cases are paid by us 

other factors 

other factors that affect our results of operations include the following 

factors influencing interest and amortization expense as a result of the ccmp transactions our interest expense and amortization expense have increased accordingly our consolidated financial statements prior to november 2006 are not comparable to subsequent periods primarily as a result of significantly increased interest expense and amortization expense we anticipate that interest expense will decrease in future periods because after december 31 2009 we used the net proceeds from our initial public offering and available cash on hand to repay outstanding indebtedness the expiration of certain interest rate swap agreements in january 2010 will also decrease interest expense in future periods 

factors influencing provision for income taxes because we made a section 338h10 election in connection with the ccmp transactions we have 14 billion of taxdeductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining as of december 31 2009 that we expect to generate cash tax savings of 557 million through 2021 assuming continued profitability and a 385 tax rate the amortization of these assets for tax purposes is expected to be 122 million annually through 2020 and 102 million in 2021 which generates annual cash tax savings of 47 million through 2020 and 39 million in 2021 assuming profitability and a 385 tax rate additionally we have federal net operating loss or nol carryforwards of 1618 million as of december 31 2009 which we expect to generate an additional 57 million of federal cash tax savings at a 35 rate when and if utilized based on current business plans we believe that our cash tax obligations through 2021 will be significantly reduced by these tax attributes however any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section 382 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 including through sales of stock 

by large stockholders all of which are outside of our control could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities 

seasonality although there is demand for our products throughout the year in each of the past three years approximately 20 to 25 of our net sales occurred in the first quarter 22 to 25 in the second quarter 25 to 29 in the third quarter and 25 to 30 in the fourth quarter with different seasonality depending on the timing of outage activity in each year we maintain a flexible production schedule in order to respond to outagedriven peak demand but typically increase production levels in the second and third quarters of each year 

transactions with ccmp 

in november 2006 affiliates of ccmp together with affiliates of unitas and members of our management purchased an aggregate of 689 million of our equity capital in addition on november 10 2006 generac power systems borrowed an aggregate of 1380 million consisting of an initial drawdown of 950 million under a 11 billion first lien secured credit facility and 430 million under a 430 million second lien secured credit facility with the proceeds from these equity and debt financings together with cash on hand at generac power systems we 1 acquired all of the capital stock of generac power systems and repaid certain pretransaction indebtedness of generac power systems for 20 billion 2 paid 66 million in transaction costs related to the transaction and 3 retained 3 million for general corporate purposes see item 1—business—history—ccmp transactions 

during 2007 affiliates of ccmp acquired 803 million principal amount of second lien term loans for approximately 600 million ccmps affiliates exchanged this debt for additional shares of class b common stock the fair value of the shares exchanged was 600 million we recorded this transaction as additional class b common stock of 600 million based on the fair value of the debt contributed by ccmps affiliates which approximated the fair value of shares exchanged the debt was held in treasury at face value consequently we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of 188 million which includes the writeoff of deferred financing fees and other closing costs in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 

during 2008 affiliates of ccmp acquired 1489 million principal amount of second lien term loans for approximately 811 million ccmps affiliates exchanged 240 million principal amount of this debt for additional shares of class b common stock and 1249 million principal amount of this debt for shares of our series a preferred stock the fair value of the shares of our class b common stock and series a preferred stock so exchanged was 182 million and 629 million respectively we recorded this transaction as series a preferred stock of 629 million and class b common stock of 182 million based on the fair value of the debt contributed by ccmps affiliates which approximated the fair value of shares exchanged the debt was held in treasury at face value consequently we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of 654 million which includes the writeoff of deferred financing fees and other closing costs in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 

as of september 30 2008 we failed to satisfy the leverage ratio in our senior secured credit facilities as permitted by the credit agreement in november 2008 this violation was remedied by an equity contribution of 15500000 from affiliates of ccmp in exchange for 1550 shares of series a preferred stock 

during 2009 affiliates of ccmp acquired 99 million principal amount of first lien term loans and 200 million principal amount of second lien term loans for approximately 148 million ccmps affiliates exchanged this debt for 14754596 shares of series a preferred stock the fair value of the shares exchanged was 148 million we recorded this transaction as additional series a preferred stock of 148 million based on the fair value of the debt contributed by ccmps affiliates which 

approximated the fair value of shares exchanged the debt was held in treasury at face value consequently we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of 147 million which includes a writeoff of deferred financing fees and other closing costs in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2009 

in connection with such issuances of our class b common stock to affiliates of ccmp in connection with debt exchanges in 2007 and 2008 and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the shareholders agreement that arose from such issuances affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of our class b common stock they were issued in connection with such debt exchanges to an entity affiliated with ccmp certain affiliates of unitas and certain members of our management and board of directors in addition in connection with such issuances of our series a preferred stock to affiliates and ccmp in connection with debt exchanges in 2008 and 2009 and the satisfaction of preemptive rights under the shareholders agreement that arose from such issuances during the year ended december 31 2009 we issued 2000 shares of series a preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of 200 million in cash to an entity affiliated with ccmp and certain members of management and our board of directors and affiliates of ccmp sold some of the shares of series a preferred stock they were previously issued in connection with such debt exchanges to an entity affiliated with ccmp and a member of the board of directors at the same price 

corporate reorganization 

our capitalization prior to the initial public offering consisted of series a preferred stock class b common stock and class a common stock our series a preferred stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a 14 annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares and equity participation equal to 243 of the remaining equity value of the company our class b common stock was entitled to a priority return preference equal to a 10 annual return on the amount originally paid for such shares in connection with the initial public offering we undertook a corporate reorganization which gave effect to the conversion of our series a preferred stock and class b common stock into the same class of our common stock that was sold in our initial public offering while taking into account the rights and preference of those shares including the priority returns of our series a preferred stock and our class b common stock and the equity participation rights of the series a preferred stock a reverse stock split was needed to reduce the number of shares to be issued to holders of our class a and class b common stock to the number that correctly reflected the proportionate interest of such stockholders in our company taking into account the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon the conversion of our series a preferred stock and the number and value of shares of common stock to be issued and sold to new investors in the initial public offering we refer to these transactions as the corporate reorganization the specific steps in the corporate reorganization were as follows 

treatment of class b common stock 

our certificate of incorporation prior to the initial public offering provided for the mandatory conversion of our class b voting common stock to class a common stock in the event of an initial public offering so that our class b common stock would be converted into the same class of our common stock offered in an initial public offering taking into account of the value rights and preferences of our class b common stock in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation prior to the offering at the time we entered into the underwriting agreement with respect to the initial public offering each share of our class b common stock automatically converted into a number of shares of our class a common stock equal to one plus the quotient obtained by dividing ix the amount paid for such share of class b common stock plus y an increase to such amount equal to 10 per annum calculated and compounded quarterly on the basis of a 360day year of twelve 30day months and which increased amount shall be deemed to have accrued on a daily basis 

ie the class b return by ii the public offering price net of underwriting discounts and commissions we refer to this as the class b conversion each share of our class b common stock converted into 1118440 shares of our class a common stock ie the class b conversion ratio as a result of the class b conversion we issued an aggregate of 88484700 shares of our class a common stock 

reverse stock split 

immediately following the class b conversion we effected a 3294 for one reverse stock split of our then outstanding shares of class a common stock including those shares of our class a common stock issued as part of the class b conversion which decreased the number of shares of our class a common stock immediately after the class b conversion from 88490028 shares to 26861523 shares we refer to this as the reverse stock split 

treatment of series a preferred stock

after giving effect to the class b conversion the reverse stock split and the series a preferred conversion there were 46372541 shares of class a common stock which were reclassified as common stock 

initial public offering 

on february 17 2010 we completed our initial public offering of 18750000 shares of our common stock at a price of 1300 per share in addition the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 1950500 shares of our common stock from us on march 18 2010 to cover overallotments we received a total of approximately 2478 million in net proceeds from the initial public offering and underwriters excercise after deducting the underwriting discounts and total 

expenses following the corporate reorganization the ipo and underwriters option exercise we had 67529290 total common shares outstanding 

subsequent repayment of debt 

in february 2010 we used 2216 million in net proceeds from the initial closing of the initial public offering to pay down our second lien term loan in full and to pay down a portion of our first lien term loan in addition in march 2010 we used 1385 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand to further pay down our first lien term loan principal as a result of these pay downs at march 19 2010 the outstanding balance on the first lien credit facility had been reduced to 7314 million and our second lien credit facility had been repaid in full and terminated this reduction in debt will have a significant impact on cash flows as a result of lower interest expense in future periods based on current libor rates 

components of net sales and expenses 

net sales 

substantially all of our net sales are generated through the sale of our standby generators to the residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell aircooled engines to certain customers and sell service parts to our dealer network net sales are recognized upon shipment of products to our customers net sales also includes shipping and handling charges billed to customers which are recognized at the time of shipment of products to our customers related freight costs are included in cost of sales our generators are fueled by natural gas liquid propane gasoline diesel or bifuel™ systems with power output from 800w to 9mw our products are primarily manufactured and assembled at our wisconsin facilities and distributed through thousands of outlets across the united states and canada our smaller kw generators for the residential portable and commercial markets are typically built to stock while our larger kw products for the industrial markets are generally customized and built to order 

our net sales are affected primarily by the us economy 

we are not dependent on any one industry or customer for our net sales with no single customer representing more than 8 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 and our top ten customers representing less than 30 of our net sales for the same period 

costs of goods sold 

the principal elements of costs of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are component parts raw materials factory overhead and labor component parts and raw materials comprised over 80 of costs of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2009 the principal component parts are engines and alternators we design and manufacture aircooled engines for certain of our products smaller than 20kw we source engines for some of our smaller products and all of our products larger than 20kw we design all the alternators for our units and manufacture alternators for certain of our units we also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage we source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable lowcost suppliers 

the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes and in the manufacturing of the components we source are steel copper and aluminum we are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities impacting our costs of goods sold we seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on product design improvements and price increases in our products however there is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold 

other sources of costs include our manufacturing facilities which require significant factory overhead labor and shipping costs factory overhead includes utilities support personnel depreciation general supplies and support and maintenance although we maintain a lowcost largely nonunion workforce and flexible manufacturing processes our margins can be impacted when we cannot promptly decrease labor and manufacturing costs to match declines in net sales 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our marketing distribution engineering information systems human resources finance purchasing risk management legal and tax functions all of these categories include personnel costs such as salaries bonuses employee benefit costs and taxes we classify our operating expenses into four categories selling and service research and development general and administrative and amortization of intangibles 

selling and service our selling and service expenses consist primarily of personnel expense marketing expense warranty expense and other sales expenses our personnel expense recorded in selling and services expenses includes the expense of our sales force responsible for our national accounts and other personnel involved in the marketing and sales of our products warranty expense which is recorded at the time of sale is estimated based on historical trends our marketing expenses include direct mail costs printed material costs product display costs market research expenses trade show expenses and media advertising marketing expenses generally increase as our sales efforts increase and are related to the launch of new product offerings and opportunities within selected markets or associated with specific events such as awareness marketing in areas impacted by storms participation in trade shows and other events 

research and development our research and development expenses support our nearly 100 active research and development projects we currently operate three advanced facilities and employ over 100 engineers who focus on new product development existing product improvement and cost reduction our commitment to research and development has resulted in a significant portfolio of approximately 50 us and international patents and patent applications our research and development is expensed as incurred 

general and administrative our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for general and administrative employees accounting and legal professional services fees information technology costs insurance travel and entertainment expense and other corporate expense we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we expect to incur additional expenses associated with being a public company including increased personnel costs legal costs accounting costs board compensation expense investor relations costs higher insurance premiums and costs associated with our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other applicable sec regulations and the requirements of the nyse 

amortization of intangibles our amortization of intangibles expenses include the straightline amortization of customer lists patents and other intangibles assets 

goodwill and trade name impairment charges goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid to acquire us over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired as of the november 2006 date of the ccmp transactions 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consist of trade names the fair value of trade names is measured using a relieffromroyalty approach which assumes the fair value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had we not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company 

in some periods we have recorded a charge for the write down of goodwill and trade names that was recorded in operating expenses please see critical accounting policies—goodwill and other intangible assets for additional detail on this charge 

transactionrelated expenses in the year ended december 31 2006 our operating expenses include onetime transactionrelated expenses incurred during the predecessor period related to the ccmp transactions 

other income expense 

our other income expense includes the interest expense on the outstanding balances of our 9500 million first lien term loan 4300 million second lien term loan and 1500 million revolving credit facility entered into in november 2006 and the amortization of debt financing costs no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 the amounts borrowed under our term loans bear interest at rates based upon either a base rate or libor plus an applicable margin we also earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents which is included in other income expense we also recorded expenses related to interest rate swap agreements which had a notional amount of 6750 million outstanding at december 31 2009 at an average rate of 504 these interest rate swap agreements expired on january 4 2010 other income expense may also include other financial items such as extinguishment of debt 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 





net sales net sales increased 140 million or 24 to 5882 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 5742 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase was driven by a 381 million or 115 increase in sales to the residential markets due to the introduction of our new automatic home standby generator products increases in our points of distribution our reentry into the small kilowatt portable generator market in may 2008 and a strong winter storm season in the beginning of 2009 partially offset by a weaker summer storm season during the third quarter of 2009 the increase in home standby and portable generators was partially offset by a 205 million or 99 decline in industrial and commercial sales as industrial national account and other customers lowered capital spending in late 2008 and 2009 net sales were also impacted by increased selling prices on certain residential commercial and industrial units 

costs of goods sold costs of goods sold decreased 198 million or 53 to 3524 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 3722 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this decrease was driven by a 133 million decrease in materials cost primarily due to lower steel copper and aluminum costs partially offset by the increase in sales volume freight costs and labor  overhead costs also decreased 33 million and 32 million respectively 

gross profit gross profit increased 338 million or 167 to 2359 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 2020 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the factors affecting net sales and cost of goods sold described above as a percentage of net sales gross profit increased to 401 for the year ended december 31 2009 from 352 for the year ended december 31 2008 gross profit margin increased as we realized the margin improvement from price increases commodity normalization and improved sourcing of certain components and products partially offset by higher sales of lower margin products 

operating expenses operating expenses decreased 5770 million to 1373 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 7143 million for the year ended december 31 2008 because of the goodwill and tradename impairment operating expenses were 5835 million higher for the year ended december 31 2008 the remaining increase in operating expenses of 65 million in 2009 was driven by an increase in amortization of intangibles of 44 million primarily due to the recharacterization of a particular trade name from indefinitelived to defined life the impairment of the particular trade name was a result of the implementation of our rebranding strategy whereby we consolidated brands under the generac label and have begun phasing out the particular trade name over time selling and service expenses also increased 24 million due to higher variable expenses related to our increase in net sales such as warranty commission and credit card fees as well as higher advertising costs research and development expenses increased 09 million from ongoing product development and engineering resource investment general and administrative expenses declined 12 million due to cost containment initiatives across the business 

other expense other expense increased 119 million or 274 to 551 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 433 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase was driven by a decrease in gains on the extinguishment of debt of 506 million partially offset by a decline in interest expense of 372 million as a result of our reduction in indebtedness and lower libor rates the gains on extinguishment of debt and the related decrease in interest expense are due 

to the debt repurchases by affiliates of ccmp which were subsequently contributed to our company in exchange for shares of our class b voting common stock and series a preferred stock 

income tax expense income tax expense was 03 million for the year ended december 31 2009 a decline of 01 million from 04 million for the year ended december 31 2008 income tax expense primarily relates to certain state income taxes based on profitability measures other than net income 

net income loss as a result of the factors identified above we generated net income of 431 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to a net loss of 5560 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in net income is due to the items previously described 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 



  



net sales net sales increased 185 million or 33 to 5742 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 5557 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was driven by a 259 million or 84 increase in sales to the residential markets partially offset by a 95 million or 219 decrease in other sales driven by weakness in the rv market the increase in sales to the residential markets was driven by our reentry into the small kilowatt portable generator market in the second quarter of 2008 increased sales volumes of standby generators following the redesign of our automatic home standby generators and growth in our dealer and electrical wholesale 

points of distribution demand for home standby and portable products was also aided by heightened awareness following a strong hurricane and winter ice storm season in 2008 we also experienced a modest increase in sales to commercial and industrial markets 

costs of goods sold costs of goods sold increased 388 million or 116 to 3722 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 3334 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was driven primarily by a 351 million increase in materials cost due to higher steel copper and aluminum commodity prices and higher sales volumes additionally labor expenses increased by 32 million due to higher sales volumes 

gross profit gross profit decreased 202 million or 91 to 2020 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 2223 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as a percentage of net sales gross profit declined to 352 for the year ended december 31 2008 from 400 for the year ended december 31 2007 this decline was primarily due to the abovementioned increases in commodity prices new product launch costs as well as an increase in sales of lower margin products 

operating expenses operating expenses increased 5869 million to 7143 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 1274 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this increase is primarily attributable to a 5835 million goodwill and trade name impairment charge that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition to the increase in operating expenses related to the goodwill and trade name impairment charge operating expenses increased 34 million or 27 this was driven primarily by a 48 million increase in selling and service expenses due to increased sales volumes and associated increases in freight and warranty expenses research and development costs also increased by 03 million from ongoing product development as a percentage of net sales operating expenses excluding the goodwill and trade name impairment charge declined to 228 for the year ended december 31 2008 from 229 for the year ended december 31 2007 due to cost management efforts including a 17 million decline in general and administrative expense and operating cost leverage over higher sales volumes 

other expense other expense decreased 619 million or 589 to 433 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 1051 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this decline was driven by a 466 million increase in gains on the extinguishment of debt to 654 million as well as a 173 million decrease in interest expense as a result of debt repurchases made during the year and the ongoing deleveraging of the business the debt repurchases consisted of purchases by affiliates of ccmp which were subsequently contributed to our company in exchange for shares of our class b common stock and series a preferred stock 

income tax expense benefit we incurred an income tax expense of 04 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to an income tax benefit of 06 million for the year ended december 31 2007

liquidity and financial position 

our primary cash requirements include the payment of our raw material and components suppliers salaries  benefits operating expenses interest and principal payments on our debt and capital expenditures we finance our operations primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility if any in november 2006 generac power systems entered into a sevenyear 9500 million first lien term loan a sevenandahalf year 4300 million second lien term loan and a sixyear 1500 million revolving credit facility as of december 31 2009 

we have paid 294 million in first lien principal and our affiliates have repurchased and contributed 99 million in face value of generac power systems first lien term loan our affiliates have also repurchased and contributed 2491 million in face value of generac power systems second lien term loan

longterm liquidity 

we believe that our cash flow from operations our availability under our revolving credit facility combined with our low capital expenditure requirements and favorable tax attributes will provide us with sufficient capital to continue to grow our business in the next twelve months and beyond however we will use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay interest on our outstanding debt limiting the amount available for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes as we continue to expand our business we may in the future require additional capital to fund working capital capital expenditures or acquisitions

1 includes 95 million of required quarterly term loan installments and 296 million of annual excess cash flow payment due in 2010 does not take into effect the repayment of debt in february 2010 from the proceeds of our initial public offering or the additional payment of debt made in march 2010 from available cash on hand 2 assumes all debt will remain outstanding until maturity and using the interest rates in effect for our senior secured credit facilities as of december 31 2009 3 pension obligations are excluded from this table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment due to the inherent assumptions underlying the obligation no minimum required contribution is expected to our pension plans in 2010 

capital expenditures 

our operations require capital expenditures for technology tooling equipment capacity expansion and upgrades capital expenditures were 45 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and were funded through cash from operations capital expenditures were 52 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and were funded through cash from operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for selected dealers this arrangement provides liquidity for our dealers by financing dealer purchases of products with credit availability from the finance company we receive payment from the finance company within a few days of shipment and our dealers are given a longer period of time to pay the finance provider if our dealers do not pay the finance company we may be required to repurchase the applicable inventory held by the dealer for financed purchases prior to april 2009 we also indemnify the financing company for credit losses up to 50 of the financed balance where inventory cannot be returned in 2009 we entered into a floor plan financing arrangement with another financing company 

under which we do not indemnify the financing company for credit losses associated with unreturnable inventory 

total inventory financed accounted for approximately 5 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 and approximately 4 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 the amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding was 75 million and 74 million as of december 31 2008 and 2009 respectively 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations however our business could be affected by inflation in the future 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset liability revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company including information about contingencies risk and financial condition the company believes given current facts and circumstances that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to accounting principles generally accepted in the us and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise the company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable inventories property plant and equipment and prepaid expenses management believes the companys most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment defined benefit pension obligations estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty other contingencies derivative accounting and income taxes 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and trade names and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a twostep process the first step is the estimation of fair value of the applicable reporting unit we have determined we have one reporting unit and all significant decisions are made on a companywide basis by our chief operating decision maker estimated fair value is based on management judgments and assumptions with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm and those fair values are compared with our aggregate carrying value if our fair value is greater than the carrying amount there is no impairment if our carrying amount is greater than the fair value then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment if any 

the second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill which is compared to its carrying value the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit at the hypothetical fair value assuming the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of the entire reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 

as of october 31 2008 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test our fair value was estimated based on a weighted analysis of discounted cash flows and comparable public company 

analysis ie market approach the rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk where appropriate in determining the estimated future cash flows current and future levels of income are considered as well as business trends and market conditions due to an increase in the our weighted average cost of capital and lower comparable public company market values resulting from weakening economic conditions the analysis indicated the potential for impairment 

we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment evaluation with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm and determined an impairment of goodwill existed accordingly a noncash charge of 5032 million was recognized in 2008 for goodwill impairment 

we performed our annual fair valuebased impairment test on trade names as of october 31 2008 as a result of the test we recorded a noncash charge of 803 million for trade name impairment the primary reason for this impairment charge related to a rebranding strategy which was committed to in the fourth quarter of 2008 and resulted in our plan to discontinue use of the guardian® trade name over time as we consolidate brands under the generac label accordingly this particular trade name was written down to its estimated realizable value of 87 million which will be amortized over its remaining useful life of two years 

as of october 31 2009 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test which indicated a premium over net book value of 71 the testing determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time in addition we performed our annual fair valuebased impairment test on trade names as of october 31 2009 the testing determined that there was no impairment of our trade names at that time 

we can make no assurances that remaining goodwill or trade names will not be impaired in the future when preparing a discounted cash flow analysis we make a number of key estimates and assumptions we estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs this in turn involves further estimates such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates in addition we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures market betas riskfree rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing changes in these key estimates and assumptions or in other assumptions used in this process could materially affect our impairment analysis for a given year additionally since our measurement also considers a market approach changes in comparable public company multiples can also materially impact our impairment analysis 

in the long term our remaining goodwill and trade name balances could be further impaired in future periods a number of factors many of which we have no ability to control could affect our financial condition operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed these factors include 

• a prolonged global economic crisis • a significant decrease in the demand for our products • the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner • a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate • an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and • successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue operating costs and other relevant factors if managements estimates of future operating results change or if there are 

changes to other assumptions the estimate of the fair value of our business may change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 

defined benefit pension obligations 

the funded status of our pension plans is more fully described in note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report as discussed in note 9 the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with asc 71530 defined benefit plans—pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance actuarial valuations for fiscal year 2009 used a discount rate of 628 and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 766 our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moodys aa or higher rated bonds resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows in estimating the expected return on plan assets we study historical markets and preserve the longterm historical relationships between equities and fixedincome securities we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine longterm capital market assumptions and review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans stockholders equity and related expense we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and therefore cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 

the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 

our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations given this policy we expect to make no contributions to our pension plans in 2010 

allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory reserves product warranty reserves and other contingencies 

the reserves if any for customer rebates product warranty product liability litigation excess and obsolete inventory and doubtful accounts are factspecific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations historical experience and current and expected economic conditions these reserves are reflected under notes 2 3 4 and 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report 

derivative accounting 

we have interest rate swap contracts or the swaps in place to fix a portion of our variable rate indebtedness for 2007 and 2008 the swaps were deemed highly effective per asc 815 formerly sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and therefore any changes in fair value of these swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of january 3 2009 in accordance with the terms of our senior secured credit facilities we changed the interest rate election from threemonth libor to onemonth libor as a result we concluded that as of january 3 2009 the swaps no longer met hedge effectiveness criteria under sfas no 133 future changes in the fair value of the swaps will be immediately recognized in our statement of operations as interest expense while the effective portion of the swaps prior to the change will remain in 

accumulated other comprehensive income loss and will be amortized as interest expense over the period of the originally designated hedged transactions scheduled to end on january 4 2010 

we estimated the fair value of the swaps pursuant to asc 815 derivatives and hedging  which defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value when determining the fair value of the swaps we considered our credit risk in accordance with asc 815 the fair value of the swaps including the impact of credit risk at december 31 2008 and 2009 was a liability of 242 million and 00 million respectively 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  our estimate of income taxes payable deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions and current accounting standards we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 

we have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences as well as significant net operating loss carryforwards in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment as a result of this analysis we have recorded a full valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets 

new accounting standards 

in december 2007 the fasb originally issued sfas no 141r business combinations codified in asc topic 805 this statement requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose certain information related to the nature and financial effect of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective for business combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows however this standard will impact accounting for any future acquisition transactions 

in march 2008 the fasb originally issued sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 133 sfas no 161 codified in asc topic 815 sfas no 161 is intended to improve financial standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand the effect these instruments and activities have on an entitys financial position financial performance and cash flows entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 133 and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position financial performance and cash flows the company adopted sfas no 161 on january 1 2009 which impacted disclosures relating to the companys hedging activities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates to reduce the risk from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we use financial instruments from time to time we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign currency 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of purchasing from suppliers in other countries periodically we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases in the normal course of business contracts typically have maturities of one year or less realized and unrealized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 

on february 18 2010 we entered into a tenmonth foreign currency average rate option transaction for euros with a total notional amount of 25 million the primary objective is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of the euro on our financial results 

commodity prices 

we are a purchaser of commodities and of components manufactured from commodities including steel aluminum copper and others as a result we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process depending on the supplier these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 

periodically we engage in certain commodity risk management activities the primary objectives of these activities are to understand and mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results generally these risk management transactions will involve the use of commodity derivatives to protect against exposure resulting from significant price fluctuations 

we primarily utilize commodity contracts with maturities of one year or less these are intended to offset the effect of price fluctuations on actual inventory purchases at december 31 2008 there were two outstanding commodity contracts in place to hedge our projected commodity purchases total gains or losses recognized in the statements of operations on commodity contracts were a loss of 1092000 for the year ended december 31 2008 at december 31 2009 there was one outstanding commodity contract in place to hedge our projected commodity purchases total gains or losses recognized in the statements of operations on commodity contracts were a 387000 gain for the year ended december 31 2009 

on october 5 2009 we entered into a sixmonth commodity hedge transaction for copper with a total notional amount of 14 million the primary objective of the hedge is to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations of copper on our financial results 

interest rates 

as of december 31 2009 a portion of the outstanding debt under our term loans was subject to floating interest rate risk we previously entered into interest rate swaps with certain banks the notional amount of these swaps was 6750 million as of december 31 2009 these swaps expired on january 4 2010 at december 31 2009 the fair value of the swaps reduced for our credit risk and excluding related accrued interest was a liability of 00 million for further information on these swaps see note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report even after giving effect to these swaps we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our term loans that are not covered by these swaps a hypothetical change in the libor interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed annual cash interest expense by approximately 42 million or without the swaps in place 109 million 

the above interest rate swap agreements terminated on january 4 2010 we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with a certain bank on january 21 2010 the effective date of the swap is july 1 2010 with a notional amount of 200000000 a fixed rate of 173 and an expiration date of july 1 2012 we expect to maintain the swap as highly effective in accordance with asc 815 formerly sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and therefore any changes in the fair value of the swap would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
