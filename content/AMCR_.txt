business strategy 

strategy 

our business strategy consists of three components a focused portfolio differentiated capabilities and our aspiration to be the leading global packaging company to fulfill our aspiration we are determined to win for our customers employees shareholders and the environment 

focused portfolio 

our portfolio of businesses share certain important characteristics 

• a focus on primary packaging for fastmoving consumer goods 

• good industry structure 

• attractive relative growth and 

• multiple paths for us to win through our leadership position scale and ability to differentiate our product offering through innovation 

these criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across flexible and rigid packaging specialty cartons and closures 

differentiated capabilities 

   the amcor way describes the capabilities deployed consistently across amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio talent commercial excellence operational leadership innovation and cash and capital discipline our values of safety integrity collaboration accountability and results and outperformance guide our behavior driving our winning aspiration to be the leading global packaging company 

shareholder value creation 

through our portfolio of focused businesses and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior value for shareholders the nature of our consumer and healthcare end markets means that yeartoyear volatility should be relatively low measured on a constant currency basis over time value creation has been strong and consistent and has reflected a combination of dividends organic growth in the base business and using free cash flow to pursue targeted acquisitions andor returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks 

segment information 

accounting standards codification asc 280 segment reporting establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements in applying the criteria set forth in asc 280 we have determined we have two reportable segments flexibles and rigid packaging the reportable segments produce flexible packaging rigid packaging specialty cartons and closure products which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout europe north america latin america africa and the asia pacific regions refer to note 21 segments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reportable segments 

flexibles segment 

our flexibles segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally with approximately 37000 employees at 169 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 39 countries as of june 30 2022 the flexibles segment is one of the worlds largest suppliers of plastic aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging in fiscal year 2022 flexibles accounted for approximately 77 of consolidated net sales 

rigid packaging segment 

our rigid packaging segment manufactures rigid packaging containers and related products in the americas as of june 30 2022 the rigid packaging segment employed approximately 6000 employees at 52 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 11 countries in fiscal year 2022 rigid packaging accounted for approximately 23 of consolidated net sales 

marketing distribution and competition 

our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels but primarily through our direct sales force sales offices and plants are located throughout europe north america latin america africa and asiapacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers design technicians field service technicians and customer service teams 

we did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10 of consolidated net sales in the last three fiscal years 

the major markets in which we sell our products historically have been and continue to be highly competitive areas of competition include service innovation quality and price competitors include aptargroup inc ball corporation berry global group inc ccl industries inc crown holdings inc graphic packaging holding company huhtamaki oyj international paper company mayrmelnhof karton ag oi glass inc sealed air corporation silgan holdings inc sonoco products company and westrock company and a variety of privately held companies 

we consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we operate however due to the diversity of our business our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable 

backlog 

working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions we maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the markets in which we operate 

raw materials 

polymer resins and films paper inks adhesives aluminum and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use these are purchased from a variety of global industry sources and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials while persistent industrywide shortages of certain raw materials have continued to occur since the second half of fiscal 2021 we have been able to manage supply disruptions with no material impact by working closely with our suppliers and customers supply shortages can lead and have in the past led to increased raw material price volatility increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers through contractual price mechanisms over time and other means we expect supply disruption and price volatility to continue into fiscal year 2023 and will continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers in an effort to minimize the impact on our operations  

intellectual property 

we are the owner or licensee of more than a thousand united states and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products manufacturing processes and equipment we have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the united states and in other countries we also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets our patents licenses and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage however the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our reportable segments patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise 

sustainability and innovation 

we believe there will always be a role for the primary packaging we produce to preserve food beverages and healthcare products protect consumers and promote brands consumers also want cost effective convenient and easy to use packaging with a reduced environmental footprint and a responsible end of life solution we have identified a clear path to provide food beverages and healthcare products to people around the world in a more sustainable way and meet our sustainability ambitions and those of our customers by focusing on what we believe are the three elements of responsible packaging product innovation consumer participation and infrastructure development we believe our commitment to responsible packaging is integral to our success our responsible packaging solutions address both how the product is made as well as what happens after the consumer uses it offering a wide variety of options to advance sustainability while meeting our customers’ specific packaging needs sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business from the investments we are making in sustainable packaging innovation and design to the partnerships we enter and to how we run our manufacturing operations more efficiently 

innovation is central to amcor’s approach to sustainability and we spend approximately 100 million a year on research and development we are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and have more than a thousand active patents we solve packaging challenges developing differentiated products services and processes to protect our customers products and fulfil the needs of the consumers who rely on them around the globe drawing on unrivaled heritage in design science and manufacturing our more than 1000 research and development rd professionals and engineers are constantly innovating new materials formats and technologies 

we collaborate with likeminded partners including customers and suppliers in pursuit of innovative solutions to address some of the world’s most urgent challenges including increasing recycling and reuse and protecting our planet we also partner with nongovernmental organizations promising startups and crossindustry initiatives and bodies these partnerships enable us to learn experience other perspectives share our expertise and expand our innovation with our partners we advocate for sound global standards better waste management infrastructure and more consumer participation 

we consider our overall environmental footprint to go well beyond the products we create we also strive to continuously reduce the environmental impacts of our operations and for more than a decade our enviroaction program has helped us significantly improve how we manage energy water and waste in every one of our locations in january 2022 we further increased our efforts by committing to sciencebased targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 these new commitments have been recognized by the science based targets initiative sbti and build on years of progress under our enviroaction program through our unique material science and innovation capabilities we also advise our customers on the best solutions for their specific needs and those of their consumers – with broad flexibility across packaging functionality formats and materials 

with our global scale deep industry experience and strong capabilities we believe that we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the design and development of more sustainable packaging and this is one of the most important growth opportunities for amcor 

governmental laws and regulations 

our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad governmental laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions these laws and regulations pertain to employee health and safety the discharge of certain materials into the environment handling and disposition of waste cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water other rules to control pollution and manage natural resources and other government regulations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable health and safety laws environmental laws and regulations based on the execution of our environmental health and safety management system and regular audits of those processes and systems however we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to noncompliance with health and safety laws environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or 

operated by us including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or the offsite disposal of regulated materials or other broad government regulations which could be significant in addition these laws and regulations are constantly changing and we cannot always anticipate these changes refer to note 20 contingencies and legal proceedings of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors

 item 1a  risk factors 

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other filings by us with the securities and exchange commission could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results 

strategic risks 

changes in consumer demand — we are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries 

sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers alternative consumer preferences for products in the industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered whether as a result of changes in cost convenience or health environmental and social concerns and perceptions may result in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our or our customers inability to accurately predict customer demand end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and costeffective manner 

changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce however to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand for new or alternative products changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

key customers and customer consolidation — the loss of key customers a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability 

relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to customers while we do not have a single customer accounting for more than ten percent of our net sales customer concentration can be more pronounced within certain businesses consequently the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production requirements or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them could reduce our sales revenue and net profit there is no assurance that existing customer relationships will be renewed at existing volume or price levels or at all 

customers with operations subject to physical risks including due to climate change may relocate production to areas that are less impacted and such areas may be out of range of amcors production sites or supplying such relocated facilities may lead to additional costs any loss change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows which effect may be material 

in addition over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines this consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired while we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition — we face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business 

we operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas each with varying barriers to entry industry structures and competitive behavior we regularly bid for new and continuing business in the industries and regions in which we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand we cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness 

the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may have a significant impact on our operating results in addition our competitors may develop a disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers no assurance can be given that the actions of established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

expanding our current business — we may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth including product innovation or acquisitions 

our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in emerging markets product innovation including to address changes in the industry or regulatory environments and expansion through acquisitions however we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control our ability to grow organically may be limited by among other things extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions strategic priorities or otherwise for many of our businesses organic growth depends on product innovation new product development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences consequently failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential affect our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

additionally over the past decade we have pursued growth through acquisitions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting expected financial benefits 

we also may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations these challenges could include difficulty in integrating or consolidating business processes and systems and challenges with integrating the business cultures which may lead to anticipated benefits of acquisitions not being realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected or involve more costs to do so in addition the process of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal business operations 

operational risks 

global economic conditions — challenging current and future global economic conditions including inflation and supply chain disruptions have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business operations and financial results 

demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products including packaged food beverage healthcare personal care agribusiness industrial and other consumer goods as a result general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results the covid19 pandemic and russiaukraine conflict have increased volatility in world economies current global economic challenges including relatively high inflation and supply chain constraints in key regions in which we operate are likely to continue to put pressure on our business 

when challenging economic conditions exist our customers may delay decrease or cancel purchases from us and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers which may affect our ability to meet customer demands and result in a loss of business weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins although we take measures to mitigate the impact of inflation including through pricing actions and productivity programs if these actions are not effective our cash flow financial condition and results of operations could materially and adversely be impacted in addition there could be a time lag between recognizing the benefit of our mitigating actions and when the inflation occurs and there is no assurance that our mitigating measures will be able to fully mitigate the impact of inflation 

political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate for example in fiscal year 2022 political developments and general civil unrest in south africa and the russiaukraine conflict resulted in net expenses of 213 million including impairment and restructuring expenses future unrest in other regions in which we operate could result in a material impact to our financial condition political developments can also disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and may cause us to lose customers suppliers and employees and adversely impact profitability 

international operations — our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results 

we have operations throughout the world including facilities located in emerging markets in fiscal year 2022 approximately 73 of our sales revenue came from developed markets and 27 came from emerging markets we expect to continue to expand our operations in the future particularly in the emerging markets 

management of global operations is complex particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural political and regulatory environments of the countries in which we operate in addition many of the countries in which we have operations including argentina brazil china colombia india peru russia south africa and ukraine have underdeveloped or developing legal regulatory or political systems which are subject to dynamic change including civil unrest 

the profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by among other things 

• changes in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes 

• changes in or difficulties in interpreting and complying with local laws sanctions and regulations including tax labor foreign investment and foreign exchange control laws 

• nullification modification or renegotiation of or difficulties or delays in enforcing contracts with clients or joint venture partners that are subject to local law 

• reversal of current political judicial or administrative policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade or relating to the use of local agents representatives or partners in the relevant jurisdictions 

• pandemics such as covid19 impacting various regions of the world unequally or 

• changes in exchange rates and inflation including hyperinflation which may be further exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic 

further sustained periods of legal regulatory or political instability in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

the recent conflict between russia and ukraine has negatively impacted the global economy and led to various economic sanctions being imposed by the us united kingdom european union and other countries against russia in advance of the conflict we proactively suspended operations at our manufacturing site in ukraine we also operate three manufacturing facilities in russia which we have classified as held for sale at june 30 2022 we have recorded impairment charges related to our operations in ukraine and russia of 138 million in fiscal year 2022 it is not possible to predict the broader or longerterm consequences of this conflict further sanctions as well as steps taken by our customers suppliers or other stakeholders may disrupt our ability to sell our assets in russia continued escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the conflict could result in the loss of property supply chain disruptions significant inflationary pressure on raw material prices and cost and supply of other resources such as energy and natural gas fluctuations in our customers’ buying patterns given regional shortages of food ingredients and other factors credit and capital market disruption which could impact our ability to obtain financing increase in interest rates and adverse foreign exchange impacts these broader consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

the international scope of our operations which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to certain economic sanctions administered by the us office of foreign assets control and the us department of state and trade and other applicable national and supranational organizations collectively sanctions and operations in certain countries that are from time to time subject to sanctions including those enacted as a result of the russiaukraine conflict also requires us to maintain internal processes and control procedures failure to do so could result in breach by our employees of various laws and regulations including those relating to money laundering corruption export control fraud bribery insider trading antitrust competition and economic sanctions whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise any such breach could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result in reputational damage to our business which effect may be material 

raw materials — price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business 

as a manufacturer of packaging products our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and other inputs including energy all of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films inks and solvents aluminum and fiberbased carton board prices for these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions pandemics such as covid19 currency and commodity price fluctuations resource availability transportation costs weather conditions and natural disasters geopolitical risks including war such as the russiaukraine conflict and 

instability and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures for example we have seen disruptions in the supply of certain raw materials such as specialty resins and increased price volatility of certain raw materials across many of the regions in which we operate since the second half of fiscal year 2021 additionally changes in international trade policy in the countries in which we operate could materially impact the cost and supply of raw materials as duties are assessed on raw materials used in our production process and global supply of key raw materials is disrupted for example in 2018 the us government imposed a 10 tariff on all aluminum imports into the united states from china and in july 2022 the us department of commerce announced an investigation to determine whether imports of aluminum from thailand and south korea circumvented the duties on chinese aluminum 

while we have largely been able to successfully manage through these supply disruptions and related price volatility there is no assurance we will be able to successfully navigate through any ongoing and future disruptions increases in costs and disruptions in supply can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies including by entering into contracts with certain customers which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increases in raw material costs and seeking alternative sources of supply for key raw materials there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements or mitigate supply disruptions in addition there may be delays in adjusting prices to correspond with underlying raw material costs and corresponding impacts on our working capital and level of indebtedness and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows which effect may be material 

commercial risks — we are subject to production supply and other commercial risks including counterparty credit risks which may be exacerbated in times of economic volatility 

we face a number of commercial risks including i operational disruption such as mechanical or technological failures or forced closures due to pandemics or war such as covid19 or the russiaukraine conflict each of which could in turn lead to production loss andor increased costs ii shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers or their inability to supply inputs and iii risks associated with development projects such as cost overruns and delays 

supply shortages fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping capacity or other disruptions in our supply chain including as a result of sourcing materials from a single supplier or those that may occur related to covid19 or other natural disasters or war could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of raw materials equipment and other supplies and in turn adversely impact our ability to supply products to our customers such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in response to the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing and temporary screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our employees illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively impact our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business activities 

additionally the insolvency of or contractual default by any of our customers suppliers and financial institutions such as banks and insurance providers may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition such risks are exacerbated in times of economic volatility such as economic volatility caused by covid19 and the russiaukraine conflict either globally or in the geographies and industries in which our customers operate if a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts may need to be written off if a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project we may need to find a replacement to fulfill that party’s obligations or alternatively fulfill those obligations ourselves which is likely to be more expensive the occurrence of any of these risks including any default by our counterparties could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows which effect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage 

global health outbreaks — our business and operations may be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic covid19 or other similar pandemics 

our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by outbreaks of contagious diseases including covid19 as a result of covid19 governmental authorities have implemented and in certain regions are continuing to implement numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on gatherings quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services we have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services 

covid19 has in the past and could in the future result in the temporary closure of our facilities the facilities of our suppliers or other suppliers in our supply chain in limited cases to date certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak within their facilities which has impacted their demand and we may continue to experience volatility in demand from temporary customer shutdowns in addition covid19 has significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and financial markets of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of capital markets supply chains foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates covid19 may result in a prolonged economic downturn such as increased unemployment decreases in capital spending business shutdowns or economic recessions which could negatively affect demand for our customers’ products despite our efforts to manage these impacts the extent to which covid19 or other pandemics impact our business and operations including our ability to secure financing at attractive rates is unknown and the effect could be material 

attracting and retaining skilled workforce — if we are unable to attract and retain our global executive management team and our skilled workforce we may be adversely affected 

our continued success depends on our ability to identify attract develop and retain skilled personnel in our global executive management team and our operations we focus on our talent acquisition processes as well as our onboarding and talent and leadership programs to ensure our key new hires and skilled personnel’s efficiency and effectiveness aligns with amcor’s values and ways of working however any failure to successfully transition key new hires and retain our skilled personnel in any of our operations and our global executive management team could impact our ability to execute on our strategic plans make it difficult to meet our performance objectives and be disruptive to our business 

we are also impacted by regional labor shortages inflationary pressures on wages and an increasingly competitive labor market while we have been successful to date in responding to regional labor shortages and maintaining plans for continuity of succession there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage through future labor shortages or recruit develop assimilate motivate and retain employees in the future who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture 

operational ehs risks — we are subject to costs and liabilities related to current and future environment health and safety ehs laws and regulations as well as changes in the global climate that could adversely affect our business 

we are required to comply with ehs laws rules and regulations in each of the countries in which we operate and do business additionally many of our products come into contact with the healthcare products and food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditure of financial and employee resources 

in addition changes to such laws regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly and some of the proposals if adopted might directly or indirectly result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units for instance an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials additionally increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change including greenhouse gas carbon emissions and other climaterelated regulations could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices increased cost of fossil fuelbased inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs however any such changes are uncertain and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance 

federal state provincial and local laws and requirements pertaining to workplace health and safety conditions are significant factors in our business to assure our people at all locations are able to go home safely every day changes to these laws and requirements may result in additional costs and actions across the affected country andor region various government agencies may promulgate new or modified legislation and implement special emphasis programs and enforcement actions that could impact specific company operations covered by the respective program 

federal state provincial foreign and local environmental requirements relating to air soil and water quality handling discharge storage and disposal of a variety of substances and climate change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operations we may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is or was contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own used or operate including facilities that may be acquired by us in the future legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties as well as mandated remediation programs that require substantial and in some instances unplanned capital expenditure 

we have incurred in the past and may incur in the future fines penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters and costs relating to the damage of natural resources lost property values and toxic tort claims provisions are raised 

when it is considered probable that we have some liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated however because the extent of potential environmental damage and the extent of our liability for such damage is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently provisioned amount accordingly additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position which may be material 

the effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may adversely affect our business a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating introducing regulatory change to address the impacts of climate change which where implemented may have adverse impacts on our operations or financial results 

labor disputes — we are subject to the risk of labor disputes which could adversely affect our business 

although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disputes in the future including protests and strikes which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation although we consider our relations with our employees to be good there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future 

climate change  our business is subject to risks related to climate change which could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

climate change may have a progressively adverse impact on our business and those of our customers suppliers and partners many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters including earthquakes snowstorms hurricanes flooding forest fires and drought such events may have a physical impact on our facilities inventory suppliers and equipment and any unplanned downtime at any of our facilities could result in unabsorbed costs that could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime longerterm climate change patterns could significantly alter customer demand which is especially true for customers who rely on supply chains routinely impacted by weather for example agricultural supply chains would be impacted by increased levels of drought or flooding and customers in coastal regions would be impacted by frequent flooding 

information technology and cybersecurity risks 

information technology — a failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations compromise customer employee supplier and other data and could negatively affect our business 

we rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and various business functions and on various technologies to process store and report information about our business and to interact with customers suppliers and employees around the world in addition our information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures these measures cover technical changes to our network security organization and governance changes as well as alignment of thirdparty suppliers on market standards as with all information technology systems our systems may be susceptible to damage disruption information loss or shutdown due to a variety of factors including power outages failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software hardware failures computer viruses catastrophic events telecommunications failures user errors unauthorized access and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functionality 

cybersecurity risk — the disruption of our operations or risk of loss of our sensitive business information could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

increased cyberattacks including computer viruses ransomware unauthorized access attempts phishing hacking and other types of attacks pose a risk to the security and availability of our information technology systems including those provided by third parties we have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual and attempted cyberattacks of our information technology systems and networks geopolitical turmoil including as a result of the russiaukraine conflict heightens the risk of cyberattacks while we have operational safeguards in place to detect and prevent cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any significant impacts our safeguards may not always be able to prevent a cyberattack from impacting our systems which could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition our customers and suppliers are susceptible to cyberattacks and disruption to their information technology systems could result in reduced demand for our products or limit our ability to supply our products 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such information our facilities and systems 

and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches cyberattacks misplaced or lost data and programming andor user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information information system damages disruptions shutdowns or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions transaction errors loss of customers and business opportunities violation of privacy laws and legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention negative publicity resulting in reputational damage reimbursement or compensatory payments and other costs any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows which affect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

financial risks 

indebtedness and credit rating — a significant increase in our indebtedness or a downgrade in our credit rating could reduce our operating flexibility and increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

at june 30 2022 we had 65 billion of debt outstanding and a 14 billion undrawn revolving credit facility and we are not restricted in incurring and may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our indebtedness is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows which is dependent in part on prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to maintain sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt commitments our financial condition and results of operations are likely to be materially adversely impacted 

we use cash provided by operations commercial paper issuances bank term loans committed revolving credit facilities debt issuances and equity issuances to meet our funding needs credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on many factors including our financial results their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the global economy any significant additional indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt actions taken by the rating agencies include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for a possible future downgrade if rating agencies downgrade our credit rating place us on a watch list or if there are adverse market conditions including disruptions in the commercial paper market the impacts could include reduced access to the commercial paper credit and capital markets an increase in the cost of our borrowings or the fees associated with our bank credit facility or an increase in the credit spread incurred when issuing debt in the capital markets refer to item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of this annual report on form 10k for more information on our credit rating profile 

in addition a significant number of our operating subsidiaries are not guarantors of our indebtedness in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up the assets of such subsidiary will be used to satisfy the claims of its creditors the nonguarantor subsidiaries have no direct obligations in respect of our indebtedness and therefore a direct claim against any nonguarantor subsidiary and any claims to enforce payment on our indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of the creditors of our nonguarantor subsidiaries 

exchange rates — we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk both transactional and translational which may negatively affect our financial performance transactional foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations including in respect of the us dollar the euro the russian ruble and other currencies including in latin america in which our costs are denominated which may affect our business input costs and proceeds from product sales translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity functional currencies to us dollars our reporting currency and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and expenses in particular our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the exchange rate between the euro the united kingdom pound sterling the australian dollar the chinese yuan and the brazilian real against the us dollar 

exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly due to a variety of factors in addition we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the currency devaluation in argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding highly inflationary accounting 

to the extent currency devaluation occurs across our business we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through us dollardenominated input costs across our business which would adversely impact our margins and profitability as such we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our 

reported cash flow financial condition and results of operations the effect of which may be material our board of directors has approved a hedging policy to limit and manage the risk of such foreign exchange fluctuations however if our hedges are not effective in mitigating our foreign currency risks if we are underhedged or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging arrangements it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

interest rates — rising interest rates increase our borrowing costs on our variable rate indebtedness and could have other negative impacts 

  as of june 30 2022 approximately fifty percent of our indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates when interest rates increase our debt service obligations increase on our variable rate indebtedness even though the amount borrowed remains the same increases in shortterm interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay we manage exposure to interest rates by maintaining a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt monitoring global interest rates and where appropriate entering into various derivative instruments however if our derivative instruments are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk if we are underhedged or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging arrangements it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

in addition rising interest rates could reduce the attractiveness of cash management programs we use such as customer and supply chain finance programs which could negatively impact our cash and working capital and increase our borrowings refer to note 14 debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our variable rate borrowings also refer to item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk including interest rate risk in this annual report on form 10k 

goodwill and other intangible assets — a significant writedown of goodwill andor other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 

as of june 30 2022 we had 69 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows or other factors may cause our goodwill andor other intangible assets to be impaired resulting in a noncash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment in addition if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions such as the russiaukraine conflict adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results if a significant write down is required the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth we have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate see item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates and judgments of this annual report on form 10k 

internal controls — if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which may adversely affect investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price 

we have been subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act sox since fiscal year 2020 while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements as any controls or procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance from misstatement we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with our listing on the nyse in 2019 related to us gaap expertise and segregation of duties within key information technology systems which were remediated in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 respectively 

there can be no assurance that we will not identify new material weaknesses in the future any newly identified material weaknesses could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial results lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

insurance — our insurance policies including our use of a captive insurance company may not provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face 

we seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance a significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance market with thirdparty reinsurers our policies with such thirdparty reinsurers cover a variety of risk exposures including property damage although we believe the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no guarantee that any 

claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid or that we will be able to maintain such insurance at acceptable premium cost levels in the future 

additionally we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a captive insurance company amcor insurances pte ltd which is located in singapore our captive insurance company collects annual premiums from our business groups and assumes specific risks relating to various risk exposures including property damage the captive insurance company may be required to make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captives reserves which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

legal and compliance risks 

intellectual property — our inability to defend our intellectual property rights or intellectual property infringement claims against us could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property we own a number of patents on our products aspects of our products methods of use andor methods of manufacturing and we own or have licenses to use the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products we also rely on trade secrets knowhow and other unpatented proprietary technology if we are unable to detect the infringement of our intellectual property or to enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may suffer the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce certain of our competitive advantages cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us our pending patent applications and our pending trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks our competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies in addition our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage furthermore many of the countries in which we operate particularly the emerging markets do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in which we operate such as the united states and the european union the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business 

similarly while we have not received any significant claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will not receive such claims in the future if we were held liable for a claim of infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all failure to protect our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

litigation — litigation including product liability claims or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are and in the future will likely become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business given our global footprint we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments in addition actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of covid19 or the russiaukraine conflict may result in legal claims or litigation against us refer to item 3  legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k 

environmental social and governance esg practices — increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors customers and governments with respect to our esg practices and commitments may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks 

there is an increased scrutiny from shareholders customers and governments on corporate esg practices our commitment to sustainability and esg practices remains at the core of our business and we have established goals and targets related to our commitment however our esg practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes many of our large global customers are also committing to longterm targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their supply chains if we are unable to support customers in achieving these reductions customers may seek out competitors who are better able to support such reductions a failure or perceived failure to respond to expectations of all parties including with meeting our own climaterelated and other esg target ambitions could cause harm to our business and reputation and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of esg oversight and disclosures which may result in increased expenditures for environmental controls new taxes on the products we produce and significantly increase our compliance costs to meet new disclosure requirements 

environmental health and safety regulations — changing government regulations in environmental health and safety matters including climate change may adversely affect our company 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products increased environmental legislation or regulation including regulations related to extended producer responsibility epr could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost increased energy and freight costs and new taxes on packaging products or result in reduced demand it is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes government bans of or restrictions on certain materials or packaging formats may close off markets to amcors business mandates to use certain types of materials such as postconsumer recycled pcr content may lead to supply shortages and higher prices for those materials as current recycling rates may be insufficient to meet increased demand for pcr within and beyond the packaging industry 

we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits additionally a sizable portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging both highly regulated markets if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

tax law changes —changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the many jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws and regulations are complex and the determination of our global provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation we are subject to routine examinations of our income tax returns and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax our future income taxes could also be negatively impacted by our mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate being different than anticipated given differences in statutory tax rates in the countries in which we operate in addition certain tax policy efforts including any tax law changes resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the g20s inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting beps could adversely impact our tax rate and subsequent tax expense despite the publication of the anti global base erosion model rules and initial commentary there are many open points to be clarified and there is still significant uncertainty which we will continue to monitor until a more conclusive assessment will be possible 

risks relating to being a jersey channel islands company listing ordinary shares 

our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of jersey channel islands which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a us jurisdiction and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other us corporations 

  we are organized under the laws of jersey channel islands a british crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of normandy france jersey is not a member of the european union jersey channel islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on english corporate law principles the rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by jersey law including the companies jersey law 1991 as amended and by the amcor articles of association as may be amended from time to time these rights differ in some respects from the rights of other shareholders in corporations incorporated in the united states further there can be no assurance that the laws of jersey channel islands will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the us which could adversely affect the rights of investors 

us shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us 

a significant portion of our assets are located outside of the united states and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of jurisdictions outside of the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to successfully serve a claim within the united states upon those nonus directors and officers or to enforce judgments realized in the united states 

judgments of us courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the us and the enforcement of judgments of us courts outside of the us including those in australia and jersey may be subject to limitations investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the us including australia and jersey for liabilities under the securities laws of the us additionally our articles of association provide that while the royal court of jersey will have nonexclusive jurisdiction over actions brought against us the royal court of jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions actions for breach of fiduciary duty by our directors and officers actions arising out of companies jersey law 1991 as amended or actions asserting a claim against our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine the exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under us federal securities laws from being raised in a us court and would not prevent a us court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims however there is uncertainty whether a us or jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for actions claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other claims

significant items affecting the periods presented 

impact of covid19 

we continue to monitor the impact of the ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business the covid19 pandemic has resulted in intermittent regional government restrictions on the movement of people goods and nonessential services resulting in a period of historic uncertainty and challenges we remain focused on our commitment to the health and safety of our employees as our first priority we expect to continue to evaluate our response and related precautions until the covid19 pandemic has been fully resolved as a public health crisis 

we have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services our facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified we expect that our facilities will remain operational given the essential products we supply however despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic including temporary closures of our facilities due to outbreaks of the virus among our workforce or government mandates 

we continue to believe we are wellpositioned to meet the challenges of the ongoing covid19 pandemic however we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our operations and financial results the ultimate nearterm impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across the supply chain the implementation of further social distancing measures and other governmentimposed restrictions as well as the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies 

raw material inflation and supply chain trends 

during fiscal year 2022 we experienced persistent supply shortages and price volatility of certain resins and raw materials in both of our reportable segments as a result of market dynamics that first materialized in the second half of fiscal year 2021 and higher rates of regional inflation impacting energy fuel and labor costs the underlying causes for the volatility can be attributed to a variety of factors including the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic resulting in labor shortages and transportation constraints energy shortages and weather disruptions impacting raw material supply in certain regions the complex factors driving ongoing market volatility continue and could be further exacerbated by the continuation of the russiaukraine conflict we intend to continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers leveraging our global capabilities and expertise to work through supply and other resulting issues 

south africa fire 

on july 13 2021 our durban south africa manufacturing facility was destroyed by fire associated with general civil unrest the facility employed 350 individuals and no employees were injured as the facility had been closed in advance of the disturbance in fiscal year 2022 we recorded 45 million in expense before insurance settlements primarily related to inventory property and equipment losses from the fire and other related expenses we have insurance for the majority of property and other losses resulting from the fire and have received 33 million in insurance settlements in fiscal year 2022 

russiaukraine conflict 

russias invasion of ukraine that began in february 2022 continues as of the date of the filing of this annual report in advance of the invasion we proactively suspended operations at our small manufacturing site in ukraine we also operate three manufacturing facilities in russia in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 after a thorough review of our strategic options we committed to sell our russian operations which resulted in a noncash 90 million impairment charge 

since our decision in march 2022 to scale back our russian operations we have remained committed to continuing to support our russian and ukraine employees and customers we are proactively taking steps to mitigate the financial impact of exiting our russian operations including adjusting our european footprint to reallocate and consolidate volumes from russia and ukraine to leverage utilization and deliver enhanced efficiencies across central and western europe as well as taking actions to restructure our regional cost base in addition to the 90 million in impairment charges on assets held for sale we incurred 48 million in other impairment charges given the expectation that certain assets not held for sale in the conflict region will not be recoverable and 62 million in restructuring and other costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the russiaukraine conflict we expect approximately 30 million in additional restructuring and other costs in fiscal year 2023 related to our exit decision 

for further information refer to note 4 restructuring impairment and related expenses net note 6 held for sale and discontinued operations and note 7 restructuring of part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements 

2019 bemis integration plan 

in connection with the acquisition of bemis company inc bemis we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization we have exceeded the targeted pretax synergies of 180 million by approximately 10 driven by procurement supply chain and general and administrative savings as of june 30 2022 

the 2019 bemis integration plan was completed by june 30 2022 with final pretax integration cost amounting to 253 million the total 2019 bemis integration plan cost includes 213 million of restructuring and related expenses net and 40 million of general integration expenses the net cash expenditures for the plan including disposal proceeds are 170 million of which 40 million relates to general integration expenses as part of this plan we have incurred 144 million in employee related expenses 36 million in fixed asset related expenses 39 million in other restructuring and 45 million in restructuring related expenses partially offset by a gain on disposal of a business of 51 million in fiscal year 2022 the plan resulted in net cash outflows of 49 million of which 47 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures the remaining cash outflow will be primarily incurred in fiscal year 2023 

  

2018 rigid packaging restructuring plan 

  on august 21 2018 we announced a restructuring plan in amcor rigid packaging 2018 rigid packaging restructuring plan aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint the plan included the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost reductions 

the 2018 rigid packaging restructuring plan was completed by june 30 2021 with total pretax restructuring costs of 121 million of which 78 million resulted in cash expenditures with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and employee related costs

highly inflationary accounting 

we have subsidiaries in argentina that historically had a functional currency of the argentine peso as of june 30 2018 the argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes accordingly beginning july 1 2018 we began reporting the financial results of our argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the us dollar the transition to highly inflationary accounting resulted in a negative impact on monetary balances of 16 million 19 million and 28 million that was reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities borrowings from banks and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity we periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions expected future cash flows potential funding requirements for debt refinancing capital expenditures and acquisitions the cost of capital sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings and our ease of access to funding sources 

the covid19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have not materially impacted our liquidity position current and expected cash flows from operating activities or available cash we believe that our cash flows provided by operating activities together with borrowings available under our credit facilities and access to the commercial paper market backstopped by our bank debt facilities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations capital expenditures and other commitments including dividends and purchases of our ordinary shares and chess depositary instruments under authorized share repurchase programs into the foreseeable future 

overview 



cash flow overview 

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash inflows provided by operating activities increased by 65 million or by 4 in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 this increase was primarily due to higher net income adjusted for noncash items in fiscal year 2022 partially offset by working capital outflows compared with fiscal year 2021 the variance in other net within net cash inflows provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to the timing of tax payments between periods 

net cash used inprovided by investing activities 

net cash outflows from investing activities increased by 294 million or by 126 in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 this increase was primarily due to higher disposal proceeds from the disposal of amvig the european hospital supplies business and other noncore businesses in fiscal year 2021 and higher capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 

capital expenditures were 527 million for fiscal year 2022 an increase of 59 million compared to 468 million for fiscal year 2021 the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the increased capital spending in the flexibles segment 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash flows used in financing activities decreased by 288 million or by 24 in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 this decrease is primarily due to higher cash net debt drawdowns compared with fiscal year 2021 partially offset by higher share buybacks and onmarket purchases of own shares in fiscal year 2022 

net debt 

we borrow from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts bank loans corporate bonds unsecured notes and commercial paper we have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings 

shortterm debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the shortterm nature of the borrowings except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months the current portion of longterm debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date 

our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to 100 of our total tangible assets subject to some exceptions and variations by facility in addition the covenants of the bank debt facilities require us to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 39 times the negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements as of june 30 2022 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities 

our net debt as of june 30 2022 and june 30 2021 was 57 billion and 54 billion respectively 

available financing 

as of june 30 2022 we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of 14 billion our senior facilities are available to fund working capital growth capital expenditures and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by two bank syndicates these facilities mature in april 2025 and april 2027 respectively and the revolving tranches have two 12month options available to management to extend the maturity date 

as of june 30 2022 the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of 38 billion of which 24 billion had been drawn inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities on april 26 2022 we terminated the previously existing senior bank debt facilities and simultaneously we entered into new three and fiveyear syndicated facility agreements providing an aggregate limit of 38 billion subject to certain conditions we can request the total commitment level under each agreement to be increased by up to 500 million for further information refer to note 14 debt 

on may 17 2022 we issued us dollar notes with a principal amount of 500 million and a contractual maturity in may 2025 the notes pay a coupon of 400 per annum payable semiannually in arrears 

on december 15 2021 we redeemed us private placement notes of a principal amount of 275 million at maturity the notes carried an interest rate of 595 

on july 15 2021 we redeemed us dollar notes with a principal amount of 400 million that had a contractual maturity of october 15 2021 and carried an interest rate of 450 

dividend payments 

  in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 we paid 732 million 742 million and 761 million respectively in dividends 

credit rating 

  our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies these investment grade credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest for various terms and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid including european and us debt capital markets and from global financial institutions 

share repurchases 

on august 17 2021 our board of directors approved a 400 million buyback of ordinary shares and chess depositary instruments cdis in addition on february 1 2022 our board of directors approved an additional 200 million buyback of ordinary shares and cdis during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 we repurchased approximately 600 million excluding transaction costs or 49 million shares the shares repurchased were canceled upon repurchase additionally on august 17 2022 our board of directors approved a further 400 million buyback of ordinary shares andor cdis in the next twelve months 

we had cash outflows of 143 million 8 million and 67 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market during fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of sharebased compensation awards as of june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 we held treasury shares at cost of 18 million 29 million and 67 million representing 2 million 3 million and 7 million shares respectively 

material cash requirements 

  amcor’s material cash requirements for future periods from known contractual obligations are included below we expect to fund these cash requirements primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities borrowings from banks and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity these amounts reflect material cash requirements for which we are contractually committed 

• debt obligations refer to note 14 “debt” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt obligations and the related timing of these expected payments 

• interest payments refer to note 14 “debt” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our interest payments and the related timing of the expected payments 

• operating and finance leases refer to note 15 “leases” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our lease obligations and the related timing of the expected payments 

• employee benefit plan obligations refer to note 13 “pension and other postretirement plans” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plan obligations and the related timing of the expected payments 

• capital expenditures as of june 30 2022 we have 223 million in committed capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2023 

• other purchase obligations amcor has other purchase obligations including commitments to purchase a specified minimum amount of goods inclusive of raw materials utilities and other these obligations are legally binding and noncancellable where we are unable to determine the periods in which these obligations could be payable under these contracts we present the cash requirement in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable the estimated future cash outlays are approximately 16 billion 550 million 500 million 300 million and 100 million in fiscal years 2023 2024 2025 2026 and 2027 respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than as described under material cash requirements as of june 30 2022 we had no significant offbalance sheet contractual obligations or other commitments 

liquidity risk and outlook 

liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to financial liabilities we manage liquidity risk centrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities due to the dynamic nature of our business the aim is to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts bank loans corporate bonds unsecured notes and commercial paper the following guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk 

• maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least 200 million that can be drawn at short notice 

• regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational investing and financing activities 

• generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets 

• maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency 

• managing credit risk related to financial assets 

• monitoring the duration of longterm debt 

• only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions and 

• to the extent practicable spreading the maturity dates of longterm debt facilities 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 we terminated our 3 4 and 5year syndicated facility agreements the three facility agreements collectively provided 38 billion of credit facilities on the same day we entered into three and fiveyear syndicated facility agreements that each provide a revolving credit facility of 19 billion 38 billion in total the facilities are unsecured and have contractual maturities in april 2025 and april 2027 respectively the agreements include customary terms and conditions for a syndicated facility of this nature and the revolving tranches have two 12month options available to management to extend the maturity date 

as of june 30 2022 and 2021 an aggregate principal amount of 24 billion and 18 billion respectively was drawn under commercial paper programs however such programs are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities with maturities in april 2025 19 billion and april 2027 19 billion with an option to extend under which we had 14 billion in unused capacity remaining as of june 30 2022 

we expect longterm future funding needs to primarily relate to refinancing and servicing our outstanding financial liabilities maturing as outlined above and to finance our capital expenditure and payments for acquisitions that may be completed we expect to continue to fund our longterm business needs on the same basis as in the past ie partially through the cash flow provided by operating activities available to the business and management of the capital of the business in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis we decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions individually based on among other factors the return on investment after related financing costs and the payback period of required upfront cash investments in light of our midterm liquidity planning covering a period of four years post the current fiscal year our longterm access to liquidity depends on both our results of operations and on the availability of funding in financial markets 

critical accounting estimates and judgments 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to retirement benefits intangible assets goodwill and expected future performance of operations our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

• the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities 

• valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 

• calculation of deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions and 

• valuation of assets and liabilities held for sale 

pension costs 

approximately 90 of our principal defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals the accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet a substantial portion of our pension amounts relates to our defined benefit plans in the united states switzerland and the united kingdom net periodic pension cost recorded in fiscal year 2022 was 12 million compared to pension cost of 15 million in fiscal year 2021 and 10 million in fiscal year 2020 we expect net periodic pension cost before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately 9 million 

for our sponsored plans the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses salary inflation rates mortality rates and other assumptions we believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets actuarial valuations market conditions and contracted benefit changes the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation as well as independent studies of trends performed by our actuaries however actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions 

the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset in the case of an overfunded plan or as a liability in the case of an underfunded plan the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive incomeloss pension plan liabilities are revalued annually or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straightline basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants the service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income the other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated statements of income separately from the service cost component and outside operating income 

we review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities the discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a highquality corporate bond yield curve derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable thirdparty indexes data providers and rating agencies in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate additionally the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future longterm return assumption for each individual asset class a single longterm return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plans target asset allocation 

pension assumptions sensitivity analysis 

the following chart depicts the sensitivity of estimated fiscal year 2023 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on assets 



intangible assets and goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired including intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential impairment all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit which is defined as an operating segment at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit we have six reporting units of which five are included in our flexibles segment the other reporting unit that is also a reportable segment is rigid packaging 

goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit adjusted for any tax benefits limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill 

in performing our impairment analysis we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative test is necessary if we determine that a quantitative test is necessary or elect to perform a quantitative test instead of the qualitative test we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using income approaches the most significant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units are revenue growth projected operating income growth terminal values and discount rates 

our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts including projected future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings adverse equity market conditions and other external events such as the covid19 pandemic and the russiaukraine conflict may result in the need for more frequent assessments 

intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships technology trademarks and software and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives which range from one to 20 years we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows and discount rates these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events conditions and amounts of future cash flows 

deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 

we deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the determination of uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained on tax audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement significant estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit additionally we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income which might result in the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets including operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards if we do not reach 

the more likely than not threshold based on all available evidence significant judgments and estimates including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the feasibility of tax planning strategies are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets if actual results differ from these estimates or there are future changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates we may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

disposal groups held for sale are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values less cost to sell to their carrying values the fair values of disposal groups held for sale are estimated using accepted valuation techniques which include earnings multiples discounted cash flows and indicative bids a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of sales expenses and a variety of other factors we consider historical experience guidance received from third parties and all other information available at the time the estimates are made to derive fair value however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may significantly differ from the estimated fair value recognized in our consolidated financial statements especially for disposal groups located within countries at war

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

overview 

our activities expose us to a variety of market risks and financial risks our overall risk management program seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks on amcors financial performance from time to time we enter into various derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts commodity fixed price swaps on behalf of customers and interest rate swaps to manage these risks our hedging activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard operating procedures and delegated authorities which provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing reporting these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the economic risk associated with movements in foreign exchange rates raw material prices and to fixed and variable interest rates but may not have been designated or qualify for hedge accounting under us gaap and hence may increase income statement volatility however we do not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in addition we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respective legal entitys functional currency to economically hedge foreign exchange risk in net investments in our nonus subsidiaries which do not qualify for hedge accounting under us gaap and hence may increase income statement volatility 

there have been no material changes in the risks described below other than increased volatility in connection with the russiaukraine conflict and the covid19 pandemic for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 related to interest rate risk foreign exchange risk raw material and commodity price risk and credit risk 

interest rate risk 

our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt monitoring global interest rates and where appropriate hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use of various interest rate derivative instruments including but not limited to interest rate swaps crosscurrency interest rate swaps and interest rate locks 

an increase of 1 in the floating rate on the relevant interest rate yield curve applicable to both derivative and nonderivative instruments denominated in us dollars and euros the currencies with the largest interest rate sensitivity outstanding as of june 30 2022 would have resulted in an adverse impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in incomeloss of affiliated companies of 29 million expense f or the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 

foreign exchange risk 

we operate in over 40 countries across the world and as a result we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

for the year ended june 30 2022  a hypothetical but reasonably possible adverse change of 1 in the underlying average foreign currency exchange rate for the euro would have resulted in an adverse impact on our net sales of 25 million 

during fiscal years 2022 and 2021 49 and 48 of our net sales respectively were effectively generated in us dollar functional currency entities during fiscal years 2022 and 2021 17 and 18 of net sales respectively were generated in euro functional currency entities with the remaining 34 and 34 of net sales respectively being generated in entities with functional currencies other than us dollars and euros the impact of translating euro and other nonus dollar net sales and operating expenses into us dollar for reporting purposes will vary depending on the movement of those currencies from period to period 

raw material and commodity price risk 

the primary raw materials for our products are resins film aluminum and chemicals we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and are exposed to commodity price risk from a number of commodities and certain other raw materials and energy price risk 

changes in prices of our key raw materials and commodities including resins film aluminum inks solvents adhesives and liquids and other raw materials may result in a temporary or permanent reduction in income before income taxes and equity in incomeloss of affiliated companies depending on the level of recovery by material type the level of recovery depends both on the type of material and the market in which we operate across our business we have a number of contractual provisions that allow for passing on of raw material price fluctuations to customers within predefined periods 

a 1 increase on average prices for resins film aluminum and liquids not passed on to the customer by way of a price adjustment would have resulted in an increase in cost of sales and hence an adverse impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 of 74 million and 58 million respectively 

credit risk 

credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss we are exposed to credit risk arising from financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments as well as from overthecounter raw material and commodity related derivative instruments 

we manage our credit risk from balances with financial institutions through our counterparty risk policy which provide guidelines on setting limits to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigating financial loss through potential counterparty failure and on dealing and settlement procedures the investment of surplus funds is made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each specific counterparty financial derivative instruments can only be entered into with high credit quality approved financial institutions as of june 30 2022 and 2021 we did not have a significant concentration of credit risk in relation to derivatives entered into in accordance with our hedging and risk management activities

business strategy 

strategy 

  our strategy consists of three components a focused portfolio differentiated capabilities and our aspiration to be the leading global packaging company to fulfill our aspiration we are determined to win for our customers employees shareholders and the environment 

focused portfolio 

our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics 

• a focus on primary packaging for fastmoving consumer goods 

• good industry structure 

• attractive relative growth and 

• multiple paths for us to win through our leadership position scale and ability to differentiate our product offering through innovation 

these criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across flexible and rigid packaging specialty cartons and closures 

differentiated capabilities 

  the amcor way describes the capabilities deployed consistently across amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio talent commercial excellence operational leadership innovation and cash and capital discipline 

shareholder value creation 

through our portfolio of focused businesses and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior value for shareholders the nature of our consumer and healthcare end markets mean that yeartoyear volatility should be relatively low measured on a constant currency basis over time value creation has been strong and consistent and has reflected a combination of dividends organic growth in the base business and using free cash flow to pursue targeted acquisitions andor returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks 

segment information 

accounting standards codification asc 280 segment reporting establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements in applying the criteria set forth in asc 280 we have determined we have two reportable segments flexibles and rigid packaging the reportable segments produce flexible packaging rigid packaging specialty cartons and closure products which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout europe north america latin america africa and the asia pacific regions refer to note 20 segments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reportable segments 

flexibles segment 

the flexibles segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally with approximately 39000 employees at 174 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 39 countries as of june 30 2021 the flexibles segment is one of the worlds largest suppliers of plastic aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging in fiscal year 2021 flexibles accounted for approximately 78 of our consolidated net sales 

rigid packaging segment 

the rigid packaging segment manufactures rigid packaging containers and related products in the americas as of june 30 2021 the rigid packaging segment employed approximately 6000 employees at 51 significant manufacturing and support facilities in 11 countries in fiscal year 2021 rigid packaging accounted for approximately 22 of our consolidated net sales 

marketing distribution and competition 

our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels but primarily through our direct sales force sales offices and plants are located throughout europe north america latin america africa and asiapacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers design technicians field service technicians and a customer service organization 

we did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10 of consolidated net sales for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 sales to pepsico and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 11 of our total net sales in fiscal year 2019 business arrangements with pepsico are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time 

  the major markets in which we sell our products historically have been and continue to be highly competitive areas of competition include service innovation quality and price competitors include aptargroup inc ball corporation berry global group inc ccl industries inc crown holdings inc graphic packaging holding company huhtamaki oyj international paper company mayrmelnhof karton ag oi glass inc sealed air corporation silgan holdings inc sonoco products company and westrock company and a variety of privately held companies 

we consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we operate however due to the diversity of our business our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable 

backlog 

working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions we maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate 

raw materials 

polymer resins and films paper inks adhesives aluminum and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use these are purchased from a variety of global industry sources and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials while temporary industrywide shortages of raw materials have occurred including during the second half of fiscal 2021 we have been able to manage the supply disruption with no material impact by working closely with our suppliers and customers supply shortages can lead to increased raw material price volatility which we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021 increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers through contractual price 

mechanisms over time and other means we expect supply disruption and price volatility to continue into fiscal 2022 and will continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers in an effort to minimize the impact on our operations 

intellectual property 

we are the owner or licensee of thousands of united states and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products manufacturing processes and equipment we have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the united states and in other countries we also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets our patents licenses and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage however the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our reportable segments patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise 

sustainability innovation and environmental laws and regulations 

we believe there will always be a role for the primary packaging made by amcor  to preserve food and healthcare products protect consumers and promote brands consumers want cost effective convenient and easy to use packaging which also has an end of life solution which will reduce waste we believe responsible packaging is the answer to achieving less waste and that responsible packaging requires three things  innovative packaging design waste management infrastructure and consumer participation 

amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as being integral to our success in january 2018 we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025 to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business  from how we run our manufacturing operations more efficiently to the investment we are making in sustainable packaging innovation 

we are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have thousands of active patents we collaborate with customers suppliers and innovators to create industryleading solutions and with other stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection sorting and recycling and to inform consumers about the importance of packaging and how to reduce its environmental impacts through recycling with our global scale deep industry experience and strong capabilities we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the design and development of more sustainable packaging and this is one of the most important growth opportunities for amcor 

we also work to reduce the environmental impacts of our operations including reducing greenhouse gas emissions production waste and water use our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions these laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of certain materials into the environment handling and disposition of waste cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water and other rules to control pollution and manage natural resources we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our environmental health and safety management system and regular audits of those processes and systems however we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or the offsite disposal of regulated materials which could be significant in addition these laws and regulations are constantly changing and we cannot always anticipate these changes refer to note 19 contingencies and legal proceedings of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors 

seasonal factors 

  the business of each of the reportable segments is not seasonal to any material extent 

research and development 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our research and development expenditures and policies

 item 1a  risk factors 

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other filings by us with the securities and exchange commission could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results 

strategic risks 

changes in consumer demand — we are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries 

sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers consequently changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered whether as a result of changes in cost convenience or health environmental and social concerns and perceptions may result in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products although we have adopted certain strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining sales there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand furthermore any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to accurately predict customer demand end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and costeffective manner 

changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce however to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand for new or alternative products changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

key customers and customer consolidation — the loss of key customers a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability 

relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to customers from time to time a single customer depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations may account for 10 or more of our revenue we did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10 of our net sales in fiscal years 2021 or 2020 sales to our largest customer in fiscal year 2019 accounted for approximately 11 of our total net sales 

customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units consequently the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production requirements or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them could reduce our sales revenue and net profit 

there can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors change to alternative forms of packaging begin manufacturing their packaging products inhouse or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before 

any loss change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

in addition over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines this consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired while we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition — we face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business 

we operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas each with varying barriers to entry industry structures and competitive behavior we regularly bid for new and continuing business in the industries and regions in which 

we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand we cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness 

the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may have a significant impact on our operating results in addition our competitors may develop a disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers no assurance can be given that the actions of established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

expanding our current business — we may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth including product innovation or acquisitions 

our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in emerging markets product innovation and expansion through acquisitions however we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control our ability to grow organically may be limited by among other things extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions strategic priorities or otherwise for many of our businesses organic growth depends on product innovation new product development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences consequently failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential affect our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

additionally over the past decade we have pursued growth through acquisitions including our acquisition of bemis in 2019 there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all other companies in the industries and regions in which we operate have similar investment and acquisition strategies to us resulting in competition for a limited pool of potential acquisition targets due in part to that competition as well as the continued relatively low interest rate environment which has made debt funding more appealing and accessible price multiples for potential targets are currently higher than their historical averages if as a result of these and other factors we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting expected financial benefits 

integration — we may face challenges with integrating acquisitions and achieving the financial and other results anticipated at the time of acquisition 

we may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations these challenges could include difficulty in integrating or consolidating business processes and systems and challenges with integrating the business cultures in addition the process of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal business operations 

we generally expect that we will realize synergy cost savings and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisitions for example we expect the bemis acquisition that occurred in 2019 will generate estimated pretax annual net cost synergies by the end of fiscal year 2022 of at least 180 million from procurement manufacturing and general and administrative efficiencies while we are currently on track to achieve the targeted bemis synergies we cannot predict with certainty that the full savings will be realized or current savings will be sustained if we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and achieve the expected synergy cost savings the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected or involve more costs to do so 

intellectual property — challenges to or the loss of our intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property we own a number of patents on our products aspects of our products methods of use andor methods of manufacturing and we own or have licenses to use the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products we also rely on trade secrets knowhow and other unpatented proprietary technology we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us 

furthermore many of the countries in which we operate particularly the emerging markets do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in which we operate such as the united states and the european union the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce certain of our competitive advantages cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business similarly while we have not received any significant claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will not receive such claims in the future if we were held liable for a claim of infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all failure to protect our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations

global health outbreaks — our business and operations may be adversely affected by the ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus covid19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks 

our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by outbreaks of contagious diseases including the ongoing outbreak of the covid19 that was first detected in wuhan china in december 2019 as a result of the covid19 outbreak governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on gatherings quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services we have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services 

the outbreak has in the past and could in the future result in the temporary closure of our facilities the facilities of our suppliers or other suppliers in our supply chain in limited cases to date certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak within their facilities which has impacted their demand and we may continue to experience volatility in demand from temporary customer shutdowns in addition covid19 has significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and financial markets of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates covid19 may result in a prolonged economic downturn such as increased unemployment decreases in capital spending business shutdowns or economic recessions which could negatively affect demand for our customers’ products despite our efforts to manage these impacts the extent to which the covid19 or other outbreaks impact our business and operations including our ability to secure financing at attractive rates is unknown and the effect could be material 

global operations — challenging current and future global economic conditions have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business operations and financial results 

demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products including packaged food beverage healthcare personal care agribusiness industrial and other consumer goods as a result general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results the current global economic challenges including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate low economic growth and difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and related economic volatility in certain economies are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our business the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility in world economies 

when challenging economic conditions exist our customers may delay decrease or cancel purchases from us and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers which may affect our ability to meet customer demands and result in a loss of business weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins all of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate for example recent political developments and civil unrest has impacted one of our operations in south africa and future unrest in south africa or other regions in which we operate could result in a material impact to our financial condition 

political developments can also disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and may cause us to lose customers suppliers and employees and adversely impact profitability 

international operations — our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results 

we have operations throughout the world including facilities located in emerging markets in fiscal year 2021 approximately 74 of our sales revenue came from developed markets and 26 came from emerging markets we expect to continue to expand our operations in the future particularly in the emerging markets 

management of global operations is extremely complex particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural political and regulatory environments of the countries in which we operate in addition many of the countries in which we operate including argentina brazil china colombia india peru and south africa and other emerging markets have underdeveloped or developing legal regulatory or political systems which are subject to dynamic change and civil unrest 

the profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by among other things 

• changes in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes 

• changes in or difficulties in interpreting and complying with local laws and regulations including tax labor foreign investment and foreign exchange control laws 

• nullification modification or renegotiation of or difficulties or delays in enforcing contracts with clients or joint venture partners that are subject to local law 

• reversal of current political judicial or administrative policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade or relating to the use of local agents representatives or partners in the relevant jurisdictions 

• pandemics such as covid19 impacting various regions of the world unequally or 

• changes in exchange rates and inflation including hyperinflation which may be further exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic 

further sustained periods of legal regulatory or political instability in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

the international scope of our operations which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to certain economic sanctions administered by the us office of foreign assets control and the us department of state and trade and other applicable national and supranational organizations collectively ‘‘sanctions’’ and operations in certain countries that are from time to time subject to sanctions also requires us to maintain internal processes and control procedures failure to do so could result in breach by our employees of various laws and regulations including those relating to money laundering corruption export control fraud bribery insider trading antitrust competition and economic sanctions whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise any such breach could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result in reputational damage to our business which effect may be material 

raw materials — price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business 

as a manufacturer of packaging products our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and other inputs including energy all of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films inks and solvents aluminum and fiberbased carton board prices for these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic currency and commodity price fluctuations resource availability transportation costs weather conditions and natural disasters political unrest and instability and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures for example we experienced disruptions in the supply of certain resins and raw materials and increased price volatility of certain raw materials across many of the regions in which we operate in the second half of fiscal 2021 attributed to weather and other events while we were able to successfully manage through these supply disruptions and related price volatility there is no assurance we will be able to successfully navigate through any future disruptions increases in costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies including by entering into contracts with certain customers which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increases in raw material costs there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements there may be delays in adjusting 

prices to correspond with underlying raw material costs and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

commercial risks — we are subject to production supply and other commercial risks including counterparty credit risks which may be exacerbated in times of economic downturn 

we face a number of commercial risks including i operational disruption such as mechanical or technology failures or forced closures due to pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic each of which could in turn lead to production loss andor increased costs ii shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers or their inability to supply inputs and iii risks associated with development projects such as cost overruns and delays in addition many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters including earthquakes snowstorms hurricanes flooding forest fires and drought any unplanned plant downtime at any of our facilities would likely result in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime longerterm climate change patterns could significantly alter customer demand which is especially true for customers who rely on supply chains routinely impacted by weather for example agricultural supply chains are impacted by increased levels of drought or flooding and customers in coastal regions are impacted by frequent flooding 

supply shortages or disruptions in our supply chain including as a result of sourcing materials from a single supplier or those that may occur related to the covid19 pandemic or other natural disasters could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of raw materials equipment and other supplies and in turn adversely impact our ability to supply products to our customers such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in response to the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing and temporary screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our employees illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively impact our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business activities 

additionally the insolvency of or contractual default by any of our customers suppliers and financial institutions such as banks and insurance providers may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition such risks are exacerbated in times of economic volatility such as economic volatility caused by the covid19 pandemic either globally or in the geographies and industries in which our customers operate if a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts may need to be written off if a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project we may need to find a replacement to fulfill that party’s obligations or alternatively fulfill those obligations ourselves which is likely to be more expensive the occurrence of any of these risks including any default by our counterparties could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage 

information technology — a failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations compromise customer employee supplier and other data and could negatively affect our business 

we rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and various business functions and on various technologies to process store and report information about our business and to interact with customers suppliers and employees around the world in addition our information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures these measures cover technical changes to our network security organization and governance changes as well as alignment of thirdparty suppliers on market standards as with all large systems our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruption information loss or shutdown due to power outages failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software hardware failures computer viruses cyberattacks catastrophic events telecommunications failures user errors unauthorized access and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functionality 

increased cyberattacks including computer viruses ransomware unauthorized access attempts phishing hacking and other types of attacks pose a risk to the security and availability of our information technology systems including those provided by third parties we have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual and attempted cyberattacks of our information technology systems and networks while we have operational safeguards in place to detect and prevent cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any significant impacts our safeguards may not always be able to prevent a cyberattack from impacting our systems which could have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition our customers and suppliers are susceptible to cyberattacks and disruption to their information technology systems could result in reduced demand for our products or limit our ability to supply our products 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches cyberattacks misplaced or lost data and programming andor user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information information system damages disruptions shutdowns or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions transaction errors loss of customers and business opportunities violation of privacy laws and legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention negative publicity resulting in reputational damage reimbursement or compensatory payments and other costs any of which could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which affect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

attracting and retaining key personnel — if we are unable to attract and retain our global executive management team and other key personnel we may be adversely affected 

our continued success depends in a large part on our ability to identify attract develop and retain qualified personnel in our global executive management team and other key roles or functions the failure to retain our global executive management team or other key personnel in any of our operations could make it difficult to meet our performance objectives additionally changes in our global executive management team or other key roles may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition key new hires could impact our ability to execute on our strategic plans we could also be impacted by regional labor shortages or lack of skilled labor while we maintain plans for continuity of succession there can be no assurance we will be able to recruit develop assimilate motivate and retain employees in the future who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture 

operational hazards — we are subject to costs and liabilities related to current and future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 

we are required to comply with environmental and health and safety laws rules and regulations in each of the countries in which we do business many of our products come into contact with the food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditure of financial and employee resources 

in addition changes to such laws regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly and some of the proposals if adopted might directly or indirectly result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units for instance an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials additionally increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change including greenhouse gas carbon emissions and other climaterelated regulations could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices increased cost of fossil fuel inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs however any such changes are uncertain and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance 

federal state provincial foreign and local environmental requirements relating to air soil and water quality handling discharge storage and disposal of a variety of substances and climate change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operations we may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is or was contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own used or operate including facilities that may be acquired by us in the future legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties as well as mandated remediation programs that require substantial and in some instances unplanned capital expenditure 

the effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may adversely affect our business a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating introducing regulatory change to address the impacts of climate change which where implemented may have adverse impacts on our operations or financial results 

we have incurred in the past and may incur in the future fines penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters and costs relating to the damage of natural resources lost property values and toxic tort claims provisions are raised when it is considered probable that we have some liability however because the extent of potential environmental damage and the extent of our liability for such damage is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of 

time our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently provisioned amount accordingly additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position which may be material 

labor disputes — we are subject to the risk of labor disputes which could adversely affect our business 

although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disputes in the future including protests and strikes which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation although we consider our relations with our employees to be good there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future 

financial risks 

libor indexed borrowings — the expected phase out of libor could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase 

a substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 however on march 5 2021 the administrator of libor announced its intention to cease the publication of all settings on nonus dollar libor and only the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings on december 31 2021 with publication of the remaining us dollar libor settings ceasing after june 30 2023 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities 

certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for libor if necessary however if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate some financing agreements that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate however we are not able to predict when libor will cease to be available whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr or other alternative base rates may be on our business financial condition and results of operations 

exchange rates — we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk both transactional and translational which may negatively affect our financial performance transactional foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations including in respect of the us dollar the euro and other currencies including in latin america in which our costs are denominated which may affect our business input costs and proceeds from product sales translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity functional currencies to us dollars consistent with our reporting currency and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and expenses in particular our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the exchange rate between the euro and the brazilian real against the us dollar the exchange rate has varied in recent years and is subject to further movement 

exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly due to a variety of factors in addition we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the currency devaluation in argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding highly inflationary accounting 

to the extent currency devaluation occurs across our business we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through us dollardenominated input costs across our business which would adversely impact our margins and profitability as such we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported cash flow financial condition and results of operations the effect of which may be material 

interest rates — an increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations 

fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations accordingly increases in shortterm interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay refer to note 13 debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our variable rate borrowings and interest rates 

indebtedness and credit rating — a significant increase in our indebtedness or a downgrade in our credit rating could reduce our operating flexibility and increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

at june 30 2021 we had 63 billion of debt outstanding and a 20 billion undrawn revolving credit facility and we are not restricted in incurring and may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our indebtedness is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows which is dependent in part on prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to maintain sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt commitments our financial condition and results of operations are likely to be adversely impacted 

we use cash provided by operations commercial paper drawdown bank loans and also issue longterm bonds to meet our funding needs credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on many factors including our financial results their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the global economy any significant additional indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt actions taken by the rating agencies include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for a possible future downgrade if rating agencies downgrade our credit rating or place us on a watch list the impacts could include reduced access to the commercial paper market an increase in the cost of our borrowings or the fees associated with our bank credit facility or an increase in the credit spread incurred when issuing debt in the capital markets refer to item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for more information on our credit rating profile 

in addition a significant number of our operating subsidiaries are not guarantors of our indebtedness in the event that any nonguarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent liquidates reorganizes dissolves or otherwise winds up the assets of such subsidiary will be used to satisfy the claims of its creditors the nonguarantor subsidiaries have no direct obligations in respect of our indebtedness and therefore a direct claim against any nonguarantor subsidiary and any claims to enforce payment on our indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of the creditors of our nonguarantor subsidiaries 

hedging — failure to hedge effectively against adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations 

we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates associated with borrowing on a floatingrate basis as well as unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our board of directors has approved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations the level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time and we may elect to change our hedging policy at any time if our hedges are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risks if we are underhedged or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging arrangements it could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets — a significant writedown of goodwill andor other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 

as of june 30 2021 we had 73 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows or other factors may cause our goodwill andor other intangible assets to be impaired resulting in a noncash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment in addition if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions such as the covid19 pandemic adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results if a significant write down is required the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth we have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate see item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates and judgments of this annual report on form 10k 

internal controls — we previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition results of operations or cash flows which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and as a result the value of our common stock 

as a newly listed nyse public company in 2019 we elected the transition period for compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act and we were exempt from section 404 compliance until we filed our second annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical australian accounting standards financial statements to us gaap a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting in us gaap and disclosure and filing requirements of a us domestic registrant we have fully remediated this material weakness as of june 30 2020 we also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end financial reporting process specifically we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key information technology it systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information we fully remediated this material weakness as of june 30 2021 see item 9a controls and procedures for further information 

there can be no assurance that we will not identify new material weaknesses in the future any newly identified material weaknesses could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial results lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

insurance — our insurance policies including our use of a captive insurance company may not provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face 

we seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance a significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance market with thirdparty reinsurers our policies with such thirdparty reinsurers cover a variety of risk exposures including property damage although we believe the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no guarantee that any claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid or that we will be able to maintain such insurance at acceptable premium cost levels in the future 

additionally we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a captive insurance company amcor insurances pte ltd which is located in singapore our captive insurance company collects annual premiums from our business groups and assumes specific risks relating to various risk exposures including property damage the captive insurance company may be required to make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captives reserves which could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

legal and compliance risks 

litigation — litigation including product liability claims or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are and in the future will likely become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business given our global footprint we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments in addition actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us refer to item 3  legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k 

increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors customers and governments with respect to our environmental social and governance esg policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks 

there is an increased scrutiny from shareholders customers and governments on corporate esg practices our commitment to sustainability and esg practices remains at the core of our business however our esg practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes many of our large global 

customers are also committing to longterm targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their supply chains if we are unable to support customers in achieving these reductions customers may seek out competitors who are better able to support such reductions a failure or perceived failure to respond to expectations of all parties could cause harm to our business and reputation and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of esg oversight and disclosures which may result in increased expenditures for environmental controls or new taxes on the products we produce 

environmental health and safety regulations — changing government regulations in environmental health and safety matters may adversely affect our company 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products increased environmental legislation or regulation including regulations related to plastic packaging could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost increased energy and freight costs and new taxes on packaging products it is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes government bans of certain materials or packaging formats may close off markets to amcors business mandates to use certain types of materials such as postconsumer recycled pcr content may lead to supply shortages and higher prices for those materials as current recycling rates are insufficient to meet increased demand for pcr within and beyond the packaging industry 

we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits additionally a sizable portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging both highly regulated markets if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the many jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws and regulations are complex and the determination of our global provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation we are subject to routine examinations of our income tax returns and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax our future income taxes could also be negatively impacted by our mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate being different than anticipated given differences in statutory tax rates in the countries in which we operate in addition certain tax policy efforts including the us corporate income tax rate increase proposed by the new us administration and any tax law changes resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the g20s inclusive framework on base erosion and profit sharing beps could adversely impact our tax rate and subsequent tax expense 

patents and proprietary technology — our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to develop acquire and retain intellectual property rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology we rely on intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may suffer our pending patent applications and our pending trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks in addition our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues 

risks relating to being a jersey channel islands company listing ordinary shares 

our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of jersey channel islands which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a us jurisdiction and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other us corporations 

  we are organized under the laws of jersey channel islands a british crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of normandy france jersey is not a member of the european union jersey channel islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on english corporate law principles the rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by jersey law including the companies jersey law 1991 as amended and by the amcor articles of association as may be amended from time to time these rights differ in some respects from the rights of other shareholders in corporations incorporated in the united states further there can be no assurance that the laws of jersey channel islands will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the us which could adversely affect the rights of investors 

us shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us 

a significant portion of our assets are located outside of the united states and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of jurisdictions outside of the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to successfully serve a claim within the united states upon those nonus directors and officers or to enforce judgments realized in the united states 

judgments of us courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the us and the enforcement of judgments of us courts outside of the us including those in australia and jersey may be subject to limitations investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the us including australia and jersey for liabilities under the securities laws of the us additionally our articles of association provide that while the royal court of jersey will have nonexclusive jurisdiction over actions brought against us the royal court of jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions actions for breach of fiduciary duty by our directors and officers actions arising out of companies jersey law 1991 as amended or actions asserting a claim against our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine the exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under us federal securities laws from being raised in a us court and would not prevent a us court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims however there is uncertainty whether a us or jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for actions claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other claims

two year review of results 



overview 

amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food beverage pharmaceutical medical home and personalcare and other products we work with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them differentiate brands and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging specialty cartons closures and services we are focused on making packaging that is increasingly lightweighted recyclable and reusable and made using an increasing amount of recycled content during fiscal year 2021 approximately 46000 amcor employees generated 129 billion in sales from operations that spanned approximately 225 locations in over 40 countries 

significant items affecting the periods presented 

impact of covid19 

the ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic has resulted in a period of historic uncertainty and challenges with the extent and severity of the pandemic continuing to vary among the various regions in which we operate our business is almost entirely exposed to end markets which have demonstrated the same resilience experienced through past economic cycles our operations have been largely recognized as essential by governments and authorities around the world given the role we play in the supply chains for critical food and healthcare products our scale and global footprint has enabled us to collaborate with customers and suppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to service our customers in dealing with the exceptional challenges posed by covid19 we have established three guiding principles focusing on the health and safety of our employees keeping our operations running and contributing to relief efforts in our communities 

health and safety 

our commitment to the health and safety of our employees remains our first priority our rigorous precautionary measures include global and regional response teams that maintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage the situation restrictions on company travel quarantine protocols for employees who may have had exposure or have symptoms frequent disinfecting of our locations and other measures designed to help protect employees customers and suppliers we expect to continue these measures until the covid19 pandemic is adequately contained for our business 

operations and supply chain 

to support our business partners we have instituted business continuity plans in each of our operations and offices globally which address infection prevention measures incident response return to work protocols and supply chain risks we have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services our facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified we expect that our operations will remain operational given the essential products we supply however despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic including temporary closures of our facilities we have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain to date attributed to covid19 

contributions to our communities 

to support our local communities we launched a global program to help mitigate the impact of covid19 by donating food and healthcare packaging products and by funding local community initiatives to improve access to healthcare education or food and other essential products 

looking ahead 

we continue to believe we are wellpositioned to meet the challenges of the ongoing covid19 pandemic however we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our operations and financial results recent outbreaks of variants of the virus have resulted in increased government actions to contain the pandemic the ultimate nearterm impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across the supply chain the duration of social distancing measures and other government imposed restrictions as well as the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies 

raw material and supply chain trends 

we experienced supply shortages of certain resins and raw materials and increased price volatility of certain raw materials across many of the regions in which we operate for both of our reportable segments in the second half of fiscal 2021 attributed to a variety of global factors including significant winter storms across the southern united states we have been able to work closely with our suppliers and customers leveraging our global capabilities and expertise to work through supply and other resulting issues to date we expect supplies of certain raw materials will continue to be tight through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 as supply channels recover barring any future weather or other impacts 

the acquisition of bemis company inc 

on june 11 2019 we completed the acquisition of 100 of the outstanding shares of bemis company inc bemis a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products based in the united states for the purchase price of 52 billion in an allstock transaction in connection with the bemis transaction we assumed 14 billion of debt 

2019 bemis integration plan 

in connection with the acquisition of bemis we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization as previously announced we continue to target realizing at least 180 million of pretax synergies driven by procurement supply chain and general and administrative savings by the end of fiscal year 2022 

our total 2019 bemis integration plan pretax integration costs are expected to be approximately 230 million to 240 million the total 2019 bemis integration plan costs include approximately 190 million to 200 million of restructuring and related expenses net and 40 million of general integration expenses we estimate that net cash expenditures including disposal proceeds will be approximately 160 million to 170 million of which 40 million relates to general integration expense as of june 30 2021 we have incurred 135 million in employee related expenses 38 million in fixed asset related expenses 26 million in other restructuring and 27 million in restructuring related expenses partially offset by a gain on disposal of a business of 51 million the year ended june 30 2021 resulted in net cash inflows of 1 million including 78 million of business disposal proceeds offset by 77 million of cash outflows of which 69 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures the 2019 bemis integration plan relates to the flexibles segment and corporate and is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2022 

restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities however they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities general integration costs are not linked to restructuring we believe the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of the 2019 bemis integration plan the restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics train new employees on relocated equipment and anticipated losses on sale of closed facilities 

2018 rigid packaging restructuring plan 

  on august 21 2018 we announced a restructuring plan in amcor rigid packaging 2018 rigid packaging restructuring plan aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint the plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost reductions 

the 2018 rigid packaging restructuring plan was completed by june 30 2021 with total pretax restructuring costs of 121 million whereof 78 million resulted in cash expenditures with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and employee related costs

equity method investment  amvig holdings limited amvig 

we sold our equity method investment in amvig on september 30 2020 realizing a net gain of 15 million which was recorded in equity in income loss of affiliated companies net of tax in the consolidated statements of income prior to the sale and due to impairment indicators being present for the years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 we performed impairment tests by comparing the carrying value of our investment in amvig at the end of each period including interim periods to the fair 

value of the investment which was determined based on amvigs quoted share price we recorded impairment charges in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 of 26 million and 14 million respectively as the fair value of the investment was below its carrying value refer to note 7 equity method and other investments 

highly inflationary accounting 

we have subsidiaries in argentina that historically had a functional currency of the argentine peso as of june 30 2018 the argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes accordingly beginning july 1 2018 we began reporting the financial results of our argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the us dollar the transition to highly inflationary accounting resulted in a negative impact on monetary balances of 19 million 28 million and 30 million that was reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended june 30 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities borrowings from banks and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity we periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions expected future cash flows potential funding requirements for debt refinancing capital expenditures and acquisitions the cost of capital sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings and our ease of access to funding sources 

despite the existing market uncertainties and volatilities stemming from the covid19 pandemic based on our current and expected cash flow from operating activities and available cash we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities together with borrowings available under our credit facilities and access to the commercial paper market back stopped by our bank facilities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations capital expenditures and other commitments including dividends and purchases of our ordinary shares and chess depositary instruments under authorized share repurchase programs into the foreseeable future 

overview 



cash flow overview 

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash inflows provided by operating activities increased by 77 million or 6 to 1461 million for fiscal year 2021 from 1384 million for fiscal year 2020 this increase was primarily due to higher cash earnings in fiscal year 2021 partially offset by working capital outflows versus the prior fiscal year 

net cash used in provided by investing activities 

net cash flows from investing activities decreased by 271 million or 713 to a 233 million outflow for fiscal year 2021 from a 38 million inflow for fiscal year 2020 this decrease was primarily due to higher disposal proceeds from the divestiture of three bemis medical packaging facilities located in the united kingdom and ireland ec remedy in the prior period and higher capital expenditures in the current period 

capital expenditures were 468 million for fiscal year 2021 an increase of 68 million compared to 400 million for fiscal year 2020 the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the increased capital spending in the flexibles segment 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash flows used in financing activities decreased by 57 million or 5 to 1179 million for fiscal year 2021 from a 1236 million outflow for fiscal year 2020 this decrease was primarily due to lower share buyback payments and onmarket purchases of own shares partially offset by lower cash net debt drawdowns

shortterm debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the shortterm nature of the borrowings except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months the current portion of the longterm debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date 

our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to a range between 75 to 150 of our total tangible assets subject to some exceptions and variations by facility in addition the bank debt facilities and us private placement debt require us to comply with certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage ratios the negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements as of june 30 2021 we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities and us private placement debt

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than as described under contractual obligations as of june 30 2021 we had no significant offbalance sheet contractual obligations or other commitments 

liquidity risk and outlook 

liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to financial liabilities we manage liquidity risk centrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities due to the dynamic nature of our business the aim is to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts bank loans corporate bonds unsecured notes and commercial paper the following guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk 

• maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least 200 million that can be drawn at short notice 

• regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational investing and financing activities 

• generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets 

• maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency 

• managing credit risk related to financial assets 

• monitoring the duration of longterm debt 

• only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions and 

• to the extent practicable spreading the maturity dates of longterm debt facilities 

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 we extended 38 billion in aggregate amount of our 3 4 and 5year revolving credit facilities via a oneyear extension option to april 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively at the same time we entered into amendments to our revolving credit facilities as described above under “available financing” we have an option to extend the maturities for another 12 months in fiscal year 2022 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we canceled a 400 million term loan facility following the issuance of an 800 million 10year senior unsecured note on may 25 2021 

on july 15 2021 we redeemed the 400 million us dollar notes due in october 2021 at a price equal to the principal plus accrued interest 

as of june 30 2021 and 2020 an aggregate principal amount of 18 billion and 20 billion respectively was drawn under commercial paper programs however such programs are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities with maturities in april 2023 750 million april 2024 15 billion and april 2025 15 billion with an option to extend under which we had 20 billion in unused capacity remaining as of june 30 2021 

we expect longterm future funding needs to primarily relate to refinancing and servicing our outstanding financial liabilities maturing as outlined above and to finance our capital expenditure and payments for acquisitions that may be completed we expect to continue to fund our longterm business needs on the same basis as in the past ie partially through the cash flow provided by operating activities available to the business and management of the capital of the business in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis we decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions individually based on among other factors the return on investment after related financing costs and the payback period of required upfront cash investments in light of our midterm liquidity planning covering a period of four years post the current financial year our longterm access to liquidity depends on both our results of operations and on the availability of funding in financial markets 

critical accounting estimates and judgments 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to retirement benefits intangible assets goodwill equity method investments and expected future performance of operations our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

• the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities 

• valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 

• calculation of deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 

• calculation of equity method investments and 

• calculation of acquisition fair values 

considerations related to the covid19 pandemic 

the impact that the ongoing covid19 pandemic will have on our consolidated operations is uncertain while the overall impact on our operations to date has not been material we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns we have considered the potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic in our critical accounting estimates and judgments as of june 30 2021 and will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact on our business and consolidated results of operations 

pension costs 

approximately 50 of our defined benefits plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals the accounting for the pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet a substantial portion of our pension amounts relates to our defined benefit plans in the united states switzerland and the united kingdom net periodic pension cost recorded in fiscal year 2021 was 15 million compared to pension cost of 10 million in fiscal year 2020 and 13 million in fiscal year 2019 we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2022 to be approximately 3 million 

for our sponsored plans the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses salary inflation rates mortality rates and other assumptions we believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets actuarial valuations market conditions and contracted benefit changes the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation as well as independent studies of trends performed by our actuaries however actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions 

the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset in the case of an overfunded plan or as a liability in the case of an underfunded plan the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income pension plan liabilities are revalued annually or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straightline basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants the service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income the other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated statements of income separately from the service cost component and outside operating income 

we review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities the discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a highquality corporate bond yield curve derived based on bond universe 

information sourced from reputable thirdparty indexes data providers and rating agencies in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate for mexico poland and turkey a corporate bond credit spread has been added to the government bond yields additionally the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future longterm return assumption for each individual asset class a single longterm return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plans target asset allocation 

pension assumptions sensitivity analysis 

the following chart depicts the sensitivity of estimated fiscal year 2022 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on assets 



intangible assets and goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired including intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential impairment all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit which is defined as an operating segment at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit we have six reporting units of which five are included in our flexibles segment the other reporting unit that is also a reportable segment is rigid packaging 

goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit adjusted for any tax benefits limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill 

in performing our impairment analysis we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative test is necessary if we determine that a quantitative test is necessary or elect to perform a quantitative test instead of the qualitative test we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using income approaches the most significant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units are revenue growth projected operating income growth terminal values and discount rates 

our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts including projected future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings adverse equity market conditions and other external events such as the covid19 pandemic may result in the need for more frequent assessments 

intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships technology trademarks and software and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives which range from one to 20 years we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows and discount rates these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events conditions and amounts of future cash flows 

deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 

we deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the determination of uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained on tax audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement significant estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit additionally we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income which might result in the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets including operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards if we do not reach the more likely than not threshold based on all available evidence significant judgments and estimates including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the feasibility of tax planning strategies are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets if actual results differ from these estimates or there are future changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates we may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

equity accounted investments 

investments in ordinary shares of companies in which we believe we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method of accounting under this method the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and cash dividends paid the assessment of whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is otherthantemporary and the amount of such otherthantemporary decline requires significant estimates we review our investments in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

acquisitions 

we record acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the purchase method of accounting we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquired business at their fair values as of the date of acquisition goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred also measured at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

we use all available information to estimate fair values and typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination for significant acquisitions the fair value measurements are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected cash flows from customer relationships acquired developed technology corporate trade name and brand names the period of time we expect to use the acquired intangible asset and discount rates 

in estimating the future cash flows we consider demand competition other economic factors and actuarial assumptions for defined benefit plans we utilize common valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and market approaches including the relieffromroyalty method to value acquired developed technology trade names and brand names customer relationships are valued using the cost approach or an income approach such as the excess earnings method we believe our estimates to be based on assumptions that are reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates which could result in impairment charges in the future 

in connection with a given business acquisition we may identify preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as part of the fair value estimates acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine the estimated amounts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date we reevaluate these items quarterly based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period 

we account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business acquisition a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of income in the period in which the liability is incurred we reflect acquired operations that we intend to dispose of as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income and as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

overview 

our activities expose us to a variety of market risks and financial risks our overall risk management program seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks on amcors financial performance from time to time we enter into various derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts commodity fixed price swaps on behalf of customers and interest rate swaps to manage these risks our hedging activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard operating procedures and delegated authorities which provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing reporting these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the economic risk associated with movements in foreign exchange rates raw material prices and to fixed and variable interest rates but may not have been designated or qualify for hedge accounting under us gaap and hence may increase income statement volatility however we do not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in addition we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respective legal entitys functional currency to economically hedge foreign exchange risk in net investments in our nonus subsidiaries which do not qualify for hedge accounting under us gaap and hence may increase income statement volatility 

there have been no material changes in the risks described below other than increased volatility in connection with the covid19 pandemic for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020 related to interest rate risk foreign exchange risk raw material and commodity price risk and credit risk 

interest rate risk 

our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt monitoring global interest rates and where appropriate hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use of various interest rate derivative instruments including but not limited to interest rate swaps crosscurrency interest rate swaps and interest rate locks 

a hypothetical but reasonably possible increase of 1 in the floating rate on the relevant interest rate yield curve applicable to both derivative and nonderivative instruments denominated in us dollars the currency with the largest interest rate sensitivity outstanding as of june 30 2021 would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies of 16 million f or the year ended june 30 2021 

foreign exchange risk 

we operate in over 40 countries across the world and as a result we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

for the year ended june 30 2021 a hypothetical but reasonably possible adverse change of 1 in the underlying average foreign currency exchange rate for the euro would have resulted in an adverse impact on our net sales of 23 million 

during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 48 and 49 of our net sales respectively were effectively generated in us dollar functional currency entities during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 18 and 18 of net sales respectively were generated in euro functional currency entities with the remaining 34 and 33 of net sales respectively being generated in entities with functional currencies other than us dollars and euros the impact of translating euro and other nonus dollar net sales and operating expenses into us dollar for reporting purposes will vary depending on the movement of those currencies from period to period 

raw material and commodity price risk 

the primary raw materials for our products are resins film aluminum and liquids we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and are exposed to commodity price risk from a number of commodities and certain other raw materials and energy price risk 

changes in prices of our key raw materials and commodities including resins film aluminum inks solvents adhesives and liquids and other raw materials may result in a temporary or permanent reduction in income before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies depending on the level of recovery by material type the level of recovery depends both on the type of material and the market in which we operate across our business we have a number of contractual provisions that allow for passing on of raw material price fluctuations to customers within predefined periods 

  a hypothetical but reasonably possible 1 increase on average prices for resins film aluminum and liquids not passed on to the customer by way of a price adjustment would have resulted in an increase in cost of sales and hence an adverse impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 of 58 million and 57 million respectively 

credit risk 

credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss we are exposed to credit risk arising from financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments as well as from overthecounter raw material and commodity related derivative instruments 

we manage our credit risk from balances with financial institutions through our counterparty risk policy which provide guidelines on setting limits to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigating financial loss through potential counterparty failure and on dealing and settlement procedures the investment of surplus funds is made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each specific counterparty financial derivative instruments can only be entered into with high credit quality approved financial institutions as of june 30 2021 and 2020 we did not have a significant concentration of credit risk in relation to derivatives entered into in accordance with our hedging and risk management activities

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso framework 2013 all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations accordingly even effective internal controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2021 based on this evaluation our management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2021 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2021 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers ag an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears on item 8  financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

completed remediation of previously reported material weakness 

as previously described in item 9a of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 we identified a material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end reporting process which we identified in our preparation for compliance with applicable listing requirements in the us and the conversion of our historical australian accounting standards financial statements to us gaap specifically we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key it systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information our main deficiencies concerned the need for improved documentation and monitoring to meet the required internal control over financial reporting standards to enable us to demonstrate segregation of duties are appropriately managed 

since the material weakness has been identified we have i developed and implemented additional controls and procedures to reduce the number of segregation of duties conflicts within our key it systems which includes the implementation of new security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitoring where practical ii designed and implemented additional compensating controls where necessary and iii developed training on segregation of duties given we operate many key erp systems globally this effort initially targeted the largest of these key systems in fiscal year 2020 and was expanded in fiscal year 2021 to cover our remaining key systems these enhanced processes including the implementation 

of new mitigating controls have now operated for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded through testing that they are designed and are operating effectively as a result we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of june 30 2021 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except as described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

business strategy 

strategy 

  our strategy consists of three components a focused portfolio differentiated capabilities and our aspiration to be the leading global packaging company to fulfill our aspiration we are determined to win for our customers employees shareholders and the environment 

focused portfolio 

our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics 

• a focus on primary packaging for fastmoving consumer goods 

• good industry structure 

• attractive relative growth and 

• multiple paths for us to win from our leadership position scale and other competitive advantages 

these criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across flexible and rigid packaging specialty cartons and closures 

differentiated capabilities 

  the amcor way describes the capabilities deployed consistently across amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio talent commercial excellence operational leadership innovation and cash and capital discipline 

shareholder value creation 

through our portfolio of focused business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value the defensive nature of our end markets mean that yeartoyear volatility should be relatively low measured on a constant currency basis over time value creation has been strong and consistent through paying dividends and growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets and pursuing targeted acquisitions or by returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks 

segment information 

accounting standards codification asc 280 segment reporting establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements in applying the criteria set forth in asc 280 the company has determined it has two reporting segments flexibles and rigid packaging the reporting segments produce flexible packaging rigid packaging specialty cartons and closure products which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout europe north america latin america africa and the asia pacific regions refer to note 20 segments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reporting segments 

flexibles segment 

the flexibles segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally with approximately 40000 employees at 181 principal manufacturing facilities in 39 countries as of june 30 2020 the flexibles segment is one of the worlds largest suppliers of plastic aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging in fiscal year 2020 flexibles accounted for approximately 78 of the company’s consolidated net sales 

rigid packaging segment 

the rigid packaging segment manufacturers rigid packaging containers and related products in the americas as of june 30 2020 the rigid packaging segment employed approximately 6000 employees at 50 principal manufacturing facilities in 11 countries in fiscal year 2020 rigid packaging accounted for approximately 22 of the company’s consolidated net sales 

marketing distribution and competition 

our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels but primarily through our direct sales force sales offices and plants are located throughout europe north america latin america africa and asiapacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers design technicians field service technicians and a customer service organization 

we did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10 of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2020 sales to pepsico and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 111 and 110 of our sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively business arrangements with pepsico are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time 

  the major markets in which we sell our products historically have been and continue to be highly competitive areas of competition include service innovation quality and price competitors include aptargroup inc ball corporation berry global group inc ccl industries inc crown holdings inc graphic packaging holding company huhtamaki oyj international paper company mayrmelnhof karton ag oi glass inc sealed air corporation silgan holdings inc sonoco products company and westrock company and a variety of privately held companies 

we consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we serve however due to the diversity of our business our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable 

backlog 

working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions we maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate 

raw materials 

polymer resins and films paper inks adhesives aluminum and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use these are purchased from a variety of global industry sources and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials while temporary industrywide shortages of raw materials may occur we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions currently raw materials are readily available but pricing may fluctuate 

intellectual property 

we are the owner or licensee of a number of united states and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products manufacturing processes and equipment we have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the united states and in other countries we also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets our patents licenses and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage however the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our reporting segments patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise 

sustainability innovation and environmental laws and regulations 

we believe there will always be a role for the primary packages made by amcor packaging protects and preserves food and healthcare products and reduces the carbon footprint and waste of products it extends shelf life and reduces food 

and other product loss across a range of distribution channels consumers want cost effective convenient and easy to use packaging which also has an end of life solution to reduce waste we believe responsible packaging is the answer to achieve less waste through innovative packaging design waste management infrastructure and consumer participation 

amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as being integral to our success in january 2018 we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025 to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world 

we are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have thousands of active patents we collaborate with customers suppliers and innovators to create industryleading solutions and with stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection sorting and recycling and to inform consumers about the environmental implications of their packaging we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging addressing the need for and increasing the supply of responsible packaging is one of the most important growth opportunities for amcor 

our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions these laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of certain materials into the environment handling and disposition of waste and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as various other protections of the environment we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our environmental health and safety management system and regular audits of those processes and systems however we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or the offsite disposal of regulated materials which could be material in addition these laws and regulations are constantly changing and we cannot always anticipate these changes refer to note 19 contingencies and legal proceedings of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors 

employees 

as of june 30 2020 we employed approximately 47000 people worldwide with approximately 42 of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years for more on collective bargaining and labor disputes see item 1a  risk factors 

seasonal factors 

  the business of each of the reporting segments is not seasonal to any material extent

 item 1a  risk factors 

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission could adversely affect the companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results 

strategic risks 

changes in consumer demand — we are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries 

sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers consequently changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered whether as a result of changes in cost convenience or health environmental and social concerns and perceptions may result in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products although we have adopted certain strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining sales there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand furthermore any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to accurately predict customer demand end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and costeffective manner 

changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce however to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand for new or alternative products changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

key customers and customer consolidation — the loss of key customers a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability 

relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to customers from time to time a single customer depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations may account for 10 or more of our revenue sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately 11 of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 we did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10 of our net sales in 2020 or sales to any other customer that accounted for more than 10 of net sales in these fiscal periods 

customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units consequently the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production requirements or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them could reduce our sales revenue and net profit 

there can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors change to alternative forms of packaging begin manufacturing their packaging products inhouse or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before 

any loss change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

in addition over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines this consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired while we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition — we face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business 

we operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas each with varying barriers to entry industry structures and competitive behavior we regularly bid for new and continuing business in the industries and regions in which 

we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand we cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness 

the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may have a significant impact on our operating results in addition our competitors may develop a disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers no assurance can be given that the actions of established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

expanding our current business — we may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth including product innovation or acquisitions 

our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in emerging markets product innovation and expansion through acquisitions however we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control our ability to grow organically may be limited by among other things extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions strategic priorities or otherwise for many of our businesses organic growth depends on product innovation new product development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences consequently failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential affect our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

additionally over the past decade we have pursued growth through acquisitions including our acquisition of bemis in 2019 there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all other companies in the industries and regions in which we operate have similar investment and acquisition strategies to us resulting in competition for a limited pool of potential acquisition targets due in part to that competition as well as the recent low interest rate environment which has made debt funding more appealing and accessible price multiples for potential targets are currently higher than their historical averages if as a result of these and other factors we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting 

expected financial benefits 

integration — we may face challenges with integrating acquisitions and achieving the financial and other results anticipated at the time of acquisition 

we may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations these challenges could include difficulty in integrating or consolidating business processes and systems and challenges with integrating the business cultures in addition the process of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal business operations 

we generally expect that we will realize synergy cost savings and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisitions for example we expect the bemis acquisition in 2019 will generate estimated pretax annual net cost synergies by the end of the third year of approximately 180 million from procurement manufacturing and general and administrative efficiencies while we are currently on track to achieve the targeted bemis synergies we cannot predict with certainty that the full savings will be realized or current savings will be sustained if we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and achieve the expected synergy cost savings the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected or involve more costs to do so 

intellectual property — challenges to or the loss of our intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property we own a number of patents on our products aspects of our products methods of use andor methods of manufacturing and we own or have licenses to use the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products we also rely on trade secrets knowhow and other unpatented proprietary technology we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us furthermore many of 

the countries in which we operate particularly the emerging markets do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in which we operate such as the united states and the european union the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce certain of our competitive advantages cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business similarly while we have not received any significant claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will not receive such claims in the future if we were held liable for a claim of infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all failure to protect our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

operational risks 

global health outbreaks — our business and operations may be adversely affected by the recent 2019 novel coronavirus covid19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks 

our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by outbreaks of contagious diseases including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus that was first detected in wuhan china in december 2019 as a result of the covid19 outbreak governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on gatherings quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services we have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services however we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of our fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future we have also impaired an equity method investment by 256 million in the fourth quarter in part partially due to general market declines associated with the pandemic see note 7 equity method investments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment 

the outbreak has in the past and could in the future result in the temporary closure of our facilities the facilities of our suppliers or other vendors in our supply chain in limited cases to date certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak within their facilities which has impacted their demand and we may continue to experience the volatility in demand from temporary customer shutdowns in addition the coronavirus has significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and financial markets of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the coronavirus may result in a prolonged economic downturn such as increased unemployment decreases in capital spending business shutdowns or economic recessions which could negatively affect demand for our customers’ products despite our efforts to manage these impacts the extent to which the coronavirus or other outbreaks impact our business and operations including our ability to secure financing at attractive rates is unknown and the effect could be material 

global operations — challenging current and future global economic conditions have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business operations and financial results 

demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products including packaged food beverage healthcare personal care agribusiness industrial and other consumer goods as a result general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results the current global economic challenges including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate low economic growth and difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and related economic volatility in certain economies are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our business the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility in world economies 

when challenging economic conditions exist our customers may delay decrease or cancel purchases from us and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers which may affect our ability to meet customer demands and result in a loss of business weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins all of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate for example the united kingdoms exit from the european union has resulted in uncertainty regarding the longterm nature of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union causing significant volatility in global financial markets and altering the conduct of market participants political developments such as this could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and may cause us to lose customers suppliers and employees and adversely impact profitability 

international operations — our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results 

we have operations throughout the world including facilities located in emerging markets in fiscal year 2020 approximately 74 of our sales revenue came from developed markets and 26 came from emerging markets we expect to continue to expand our operations in the future particularly in the emerging markets 

management of global operations is extremely complex particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural political and regulatory environments of the countries in which we operate in addition many of the countries in which we operate including argentina brazil china and india and other emerging markets have underdeveloped or developing legal regulatory or political systems which are subject to dynamic change and civil unrest 

the profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by among other things 

• changes in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes 

• changes in or difficulties in interpreting and complying with local laws and regulations including tax labor foreign investment and foreign exchange control laws 

• nullification modification or renegotiation of or difficulties or delays in enforcing contracts with clients or joint venture partners that are subject to local law 

• reversal of current political judicial or administrative policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade or relating to the use of local agents representatives or partners in the relevant jurisdictions 

• pandemics such as covid19 impacting various regions of the world unequally or 

• changes in exchange rates and inflation including hyperinflation which may be further exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic 

further sustained periods of legal regulatory or political instability in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

the international scope of our operations which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to certain economic sanctions administered by the us office of foreign assets control the us department of state the australian department of foreign affairs and trade and other applicable national and supranational organizations collectively ‘‘sanctions’’ and operations in certain countries that are from time to time subject to sanctions also requires us to maintain internal processes and control procedures failure to do so could result in breach by our employees of various laws and regulations including those relating to money laundering corruption export control fraud bribery insider trading antitrust competition and economic sanctions whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise any such breach could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result in reputational damage to our business which effect may be material 

raw materials — price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business 

as a manufacturer of packaging products our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and other inputs including energy all of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films inks and solvents aluminum and fiberbased carton board prices for these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic currency and commodity price fluctuations resource availability transportation costs weather conditions and natural disasters political unrest and instability and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures increases in costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies including by entering into contracts with certain customers which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increases in raw 

material costs there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements there may be delays in adjusting prices to correspond with underlying raw material costs and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

commercial risks — we are subject to production supply and other commercial risks including counterparty credit risks which may be exacerbated in times of economic downturn 

we face a number of commercial risks including i operational disruption such as mechanical or technology failures or forced closures due to pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic each of which could in turn lead to production loss andor increased costs ii shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers or their inability to supply inputs and iii risks associated with development projects such as cost overruns and delays in addition many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters including earthquakes snowstorms hurricanes forest fires and flooding any unplanned plant downtime at any of our facilities would likely result in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime 

supply shortages or disruptions in our supply chain including as a result of sourcing materials from a single supplier or those that may occur related to the covid19 pandemic or other natural disasters could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of raw materials equipment and other supplies and in turn adversely impact our ability to supply products to our customers such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in response to the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing and temporary screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our employees illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively impact our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business activities 

additionally the insolvency of or contractual default by any of our customers suppliers and financial institutions such as banks and insurance providers may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition such risks are exacerbated in times of economic volatility such as economic volatility caused by the covid19 pandemic either globally or in the geographies and industries in which our customers operate if a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts may need to be written off if a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project we may need to find a replacement to fulfill that party’s obligations or alternatively fulfill those obligations ourself which is likely to be more expensive the occurrence of any of these risks including any default by our counterparties could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage 

information technology — a failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations compromise customer employee vendor and other data and could negatively affect our business 

we rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and various business functions and on various technologies to process store and report information about our business and to interact with customers vendors and employees around the world in addition our information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures these measures cover technical changes to our network security organization and governance changes as well as alignment of third party vendors on market standards as with all large systems our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruption information loss or shutdown due to power outages failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software hardware failures computer viruses cyberattacks catastrophic events telecommunications failures user errors unauthorized access and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functionality 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches misplaced or lost data and programming andor user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information information system damages disruptions shutdowns or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions transaction errors loss of customers and business opportunities violation of privacy laws and legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention negative publicity resulting in reputational damage reimbursement or compensatory payments and other costs any of which could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results 

of operations which affect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

attracting and retaining key personnel — if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be adversely affected 

our continued success depends in large part on our ability to identify attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel in key functions and geographic areas losing the services of key employees in any of our operations could make it difficult to meet our objectives there can be no assurance we will be able to recruit train assimilate motivate and retain employees in the future who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture 

operational hazards — we are subject to costs and liabilities related to current and future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 

we are required to comply with environmental and health and safety laws rules and regulations in each of the countries in which we do business many of our products come into contact with the food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditure of financial and employee resources 

in addition changes to such laws regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly and some of the proposals if adopted might directly or indirectly result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units for instance an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials additionally increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change including greenhouse gas carbon emissions and other climaterelated regulations could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices increased cost of fossil fuel inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs however any such changes are uncertain and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance 

federal state provincial foreign and local environmental requirements relating to air soil and water quality handling discharge storage and disposal of a variety of substances and climate change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operations we may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is or was contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own used or operate including facilities that may be acquired by us in the future legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties as well as mandated remediation programs that require substantial and in some instances unplanned capital expenditure 

the effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may adversely affect our business a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating introducing regulatory change to address the impacts of climate change which where implemented may have adverse impacts on our operations or financial results 

we have incurred in the past and may incur in the future fines penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters and costs relating to the damage of natural resources lost property values and toxic tort claims provisions are raised when it is considered probable that we have some liability however because the extent of potential environmental damage and the extent of our liability for such damage is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently provisioned amount accordingly additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position which may be material 

labor disputes — we are subject to the risk of labor disputes which could adversely affect our business 

although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disputes in the future including protests and strikes which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation although we consider our relations with our employees to be good there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future 

financial risks 

libor indexed borrowings — the expected phase out of libor could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase 

a substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities 

certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for libor if necessary however if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate some financing agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate however we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021 whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business financial condition and results of operations 

exchange rates — we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk both transactional and translational which may negatively affect our financial performance transactional foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations including in respect of the us dollar the euro and other currencies including in latin america in which our costs are denominated which may affect our business input costs and proceeds from product sales translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity functional currencies to us dollars consistent with our reporting currency and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and expenses in particular our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the exchange rate between the euro and the brazilian real against the us dollar the exchange rate has varied in recent years and is subject to further movement 

exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly for instance the mexican peso and the brazilian real have experienced significant pressures as growth and other concerns including those related to the covid19 pandemic have weighed on the mexican and brazilian economies respectively in addition we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the currency devaluation in argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding highly inflationary accounting 

to the extent currency devaluation continues across our business we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through us dollardenominated input costs across our business which would adversely impact our margins and profitability as such we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

interest rates — an increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations 

fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations accordingly increases in shortterm interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay refer to note 13 debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our variable rate borrowings and interest rates 

credit rating — a downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to using cash provided by operations we regularly issue commercial paper drawdown bank loans and issue longterm bonds to meet our funding needs credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on many factors including our financial results their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the global economy actions taken by the rating agencies include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for a possible future downgrade if rating agencies downgrade our credit rating or place us on a watch list the impacts could include reduced access to the commercial paper market an increase in the cost of our borrowings or the fees associated with our bank credit facility or an increase in the credit spread incurred when issuing debt in the capital markets 

refer to item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for more information on our credit rating profile 

hedging — failure to hedge effectively against adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations 

we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates associated with borrowing on a floatingrate basis as well as unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our board of directors has approved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates the level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time and we may elect to change our hedging policy at any time if our hedges are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risks if we are underhedged or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging arrangements it could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets — a significant writedown of goodwill andor other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth 

as of june 30 2020 we had 73 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards these methods include the use of a discount rate to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows or other factors may cause our goodwill andor other intangible assets to be impaired resulting in a noncash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment in addition if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions such as the covid19 pandemic adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results if a significant write down is required the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth we have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate see item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates and judgments of this annual report on form 10k 

internal controls — if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition results of operations or cash flows which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and as a result the value of our common stock 

as a newly listed nyse public company in 2019 we elected the transition period for compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act section 404 requires us to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting this assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting however during our transition period we were exempt from section 404 compliance until we filed our second annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 which is this annual report on form 10k 

amcor limited was required to comply with reporting obligations in australia including the preparation of its financial statements under australian accounting standards aas as adopted by the australian accounting standards board and other relevant companies law amcor limited was not required to comply with us gaap following the consummation of the bemis acquisition we now prepare financial statements in accordance with us gaap we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical aas financial statements to us gaap the first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting in us gaap and disclosure and filing requirements of a us domestic registrant we have fully remediated this material weakness as of the end of fiscal year 2020 see item 9a controls and procedures for further information 

we also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end financial reporting process specifically we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key it systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information 

we are currently in the process of remediating the second material weakness through a process to i develop and implement additional controls and procedures to reduce the number of segregation of duties conflicts within key it systems which includes the implementation of new security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitoring where practical ii design and implement additional compensating controls where necessary and iii develop training on segregation of duties given that we operate many erp systems globally this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in fiscal 2021 we believe that these enhanced resources and processes including the implementation of new mitigating controls will effectively remediate the second material weakness but the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded through testing that these controls are designed and operating effectively 

failure to remediate the material weakness described above at all or within our expected timeframe or any newly identified material weaknesses could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial results lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

insurance — our insurance policies including our use of a captive insurance company may not provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face 

we seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance a significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance market with thirdparty reinsurers our policies with such thirdparty reinsurers cover property damage and business interruption public and products liability and directors and officers liability although we believe the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no guarantee that any claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid 

additionally we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a captive insurance company amcor insurances pte ltd which is located in singapore our captive insurance company collects annual premiums from our business groups and assumes specific risks relating to property damage business interruption and liability claims the captive insurance company may be required to make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captives reserves which could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

legal and compliance risks 

litigation — litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are and in the future will likely become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business given our global footprint we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments in addition actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us refer to item 3  legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k 

environmental health and safety regulations — changing government regulations in environmental health and safety matters may adversely affect our company 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost as well as energy and freight costs it is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits additionally a sizable portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging both highly regulated markets if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

patents and proprietary technology — our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to develop acquire and retain intellectual property rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology we rely on intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our 

proprietary rights if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may suffer our pending patent applications and our pending trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks in addition our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues 

risks relating to being a jersey channel islands company listing ordinary shares 

our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of jersey channel islands which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a us jurisdiction and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other us corporations 

  we are organized under the laws of jersey channel islands a british crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of normandy france jersey is not a member of the european union jersey channel islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on english corporate law principles the rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by jersey law including the companies jersey law 1991 as amended and by the amcor articles of association as may be amended from time to time these rights differ in some respects from the rights of other shareholders in corporations incorporated in the united states further there can be no assurance that the laws of jersey channel islands will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the us which could adversely affect the rights of investors 

us shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us 

a significant portion of our assets are located outside of the united states and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of jurisdictions outside of the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to successfully serve a claim within the united states upon those nonus directors and officers or to enforce judgments realized in the united states 

judgments of us courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the us and the enforcement of judgments of us courts outside of the us including those in australia and jersey may be subject to limitations investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the us including australia and jersey for liabilities under the securities laws of the us additionally our articles of association provide that while the royal court of jersey will have nonexclusive jurisdiction over actions brought against us the royal court of jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions actions for breach of fiduciary duty by our directors and officers actions arising out of companies jersey law 1991 as amended or actions asserting a claim against our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine the exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under us federal securities laws from being raised in a us court and would not prevent a us court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims however there is uncertainty whether a us or jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for actions claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other claims

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

two year review of results 



overview 

amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food beverage pharmaceutical medical home and personalcare and other products amcor works with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them differentiate brands and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging specialty cartons closures and services the company is focused on making packaging that is increasingly lightweighted recyclable and reusable and made using an increasing amount of recycled content during fiscal year 2020 approximately 47000 amcor employees generated 125 billion in sales from operations that spanned approximately 231 locations in over 40 countries 

significant items affecting the periods presented 

impact of covid19 

the 2019 novel coronavirus covid19 has introduced a period of unprecedented uncertainty and challenge amcor’s operations have been largely recognized as essential by governments and authorities around the world given the role we play in the supply chains for critical food and healthcare products our scale and global footprint has enabled us to collaborate with customers and suppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to service our customers in dealing with the exceptional challenges posed by covid19 we have established three guiding principles focusing on the health and safety of our employees keeping our operations running and contributing to relief efforts in our communities 

health and safety 

our commitment to the health and safety of its employees remains our first priority our rigorous precautionary measures include the formation of global and regional response teams that maintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage the situation restrictions on company travel quarantine protocols for employees who may have had exposure or have symptoms frequent disinfecting of amcor locations and other measures designed to help protect employees customers and suppliers we expect to continue these measures until the covid19 pandemic is adequately contained for our business 

operations and supply chain 

to support our business partners we have instituted business continuity plans in each of our operations and offices globally which address infection prevention measures incident response return to work protocols and supply chain risks we have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services however we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future for instance in april our rigid packaging segment sales volumes in north america and latin america were adversely impacted as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and onthego channels our facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified we expect that our operations will remain operational given the essential products we supply however despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic including temporary closures of our facilities 

we have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain to date and continue to monitor the risk of customer raw material and other supply chain disruptions 

contributions to our communities 

to support our local communities we launched a global program to help mitigate the impact of covid19 by donating food and healthcare packaging products and by funding local community initiatives to improve access to healthcare education or food and other essential products 

looking ahead 

we believe we are wellpositioned to meet the challenges of the covid19 pandemic however we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our operations and financial results the ultimate nearterm impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across the supply chain the duration of social distancing measures and other government imposed restrictions and the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies 

the acquisition of bemis company inc 

on june 11 2019 we completed the acquisition of 100 of the outstanding shares of bemis company inc bemis a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products based in the united states for the purchase price of 52 billion in an allstock transaction in connection with the bemis transaction we assumed 14 billion of debt 

2019 bemis integration plan 

in connection with the acquisition of bemis we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization as previously announced we continue to target realizing approximately 180 million of pretax synergies driven by procurement supply chain and general and administrative savings by the end of fiscal year 2022 

our total 2019 bemis integration plan pretax integration costs are expected to be approximately 200 million the total 2019 bemis integration plan costs include 165 million of restructuring and related expenses and 35 million of general integration expenses the restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately 90 million in employee related expenses 25 million in fixed asset related expenses 20 million in other restructuring and 30 million in restructuring related expenses we estimate that approximately 150 million of the 200 million total integration costs will result in cash expenditures of which 115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were 802 million of which 541 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures the 2019 bemis integration plan relates to the flexibles segment and corporate and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2022 

restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities however they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities general integration costs are not linked to restructuring we believe the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of our 2019 bemis integration plan the restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics train new employees on relocated equipment and anticipated loss on sale of closed facilities 

other restructuring plans 

  on august 21 2018 we announced a restructuring plan in amcor rigid packaging 2018 rigid packaging restructuring plan aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint the plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost reductions 

our total 2018 rigid packaging restructuring plan pretax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately 110 million with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and employee related costs the total plan cost has been increased by approximately 15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional noncash impairments we estimate that approximately 70 million of the 110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were 236 million the 2018 rigid packaging restructuring plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021 

on june 9 2016 we announced a major initiative 2016 flexibles restructuring plan to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the flexibles segment this initiative was designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand increase utilization and improve the cost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity particularly in europe to enable greater customer focus and speed to market 

as part of the 2016 flexibles restructuring plan we had closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities our total pretax restructuring costs were 2308 million with 1667 million in employee termination costs 314 million in fixed asset impairment costs and 327 million in other costs which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts approximately 166 million of the 2308 million in total program costs resulted in cash expenditures cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were 144 million the plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2019 

impairment in equity method investment 

due to impairment indicators present for the years ended june 30 2020 2019 and 2018 we performed impairment tests by comparing the carrying value of its investment in amvig holdings limited amvig at the end of each period including interim periods to the fair value of the investment which was determined based on amvigs quoted share price we recorded impairment charges in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 of 256 million 140 million and 365 million respectively as the fair value of the investment was below its carrying value refer to note 7 equity method investments for more information about our equity method investments 

highly inflationary accounting 

we have subsidiaries in argentina that historically had a functional currency of the argentine peso as of june 30 2018 the argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes accordingly beginning july 1 2018 we began reporting the financial results of our argentinean subsidiaries with a functional currency of the argentine peso at the functional currency of the parent which is the us dollar the transition to highly inflationary accounting resulted in a negative impact of 277 million and 302 million that was reflected on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended june 30 2020 and 2019 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities commercial paper borrowings from banks and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity we periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions including the recent covid19 pandemic expected future cash flows potential funding requirements for debt refinancing capital expenditures and acquisitions the cost of capital sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings and our ease of access to funding sources 

based on our current and expected cash flow from operating activities and available cash we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities together with borrowings available under our credit facilities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations capital expenditures and other commitments including dividends into the foreseeable future 

overview 



cash flow overview 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash inflows provided by operating activities increased by 6081 million or 784 to 13842 million for fiscal year 2020 from 7761 million for fiscal year 2019 this increase was primarily due to impacts from the bemis acquisition 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash inflows provided by investing activities increased by 277 million or 2716 to 379 million for fiscal year 2020 from a 102 million inflow for fiscal year 2019 this increase was primarily due to higher disposal proceeds from the ec remedy related to the bemis acquisition as compared to the us remedy in the fiscal year 2019 partially offset by higher capital expenditures as a result of the bemis acquisition 

capital expenditures were 3995 million for fiscal year 2020 an increase of 673 million compared to 3322 million for fiscal year 2019 the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the increased capital spending following the bemis acquisition 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash flows used in financing activities increased by 4715 million or 616 to 12364 million for fiscal year 2020 from a 7649 million outflow for fiscal year 2019 this increase was primarily due to the 500 million onmarket share buyback program partially offset by net inflows from long and shortterm debt sources 

net debt

as of june 30 2020 we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of 18 billion our senior facilities are available to fund working capital growth capital expenditures and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by five separate bank syndicates on september 25 2019 and december 15 2019 we canceled 2500 million and 1000 million respectively of the 7500 million term loan facility 

during the quarter ended march 31 2020 the company extended the maturity of a 364day syndicated facility by an additional six months to october 2020 and reduced the facility size from 10500 million to 840 million this facility was canceled on june 29 2020 following the issuance of a 5000 million 10 year senior unsecured note on june 19 2020 and a €5000 million 7 year senior unsecured note on june 23 2020 

as of june 30 2020 the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of 42 billion of which 24 billion had been drawn inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities our senior facilities mature between fiscal years 2022 and 2024 with an option to extend 

dividend payments 

  in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 we paid 7611 million 6797 million and 5268 million respectively in dividends 

credit rating 

  our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies these credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest for various tenors and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid including european and us debt capital markets and from global financial institutions 

share repurchases 

on august 21 2019 our board of directors approved an onmarket buyback of 500 million of ordinary shares and chess depositary instruments cdis during the twelve months ended june 30 2020 the company repurchased approximately 5000 million excluding transaction costs or 539 million shares the shares repurchased as part of the program were canceled upon repurchase 

we had cash outflows of 670 million 202 million and 357 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market during fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of sharebased compensation awards and shares purchased for shareholder settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 as of june 30 2020 2019 and 2018 we held treasury shares at cost of 670 million 161 million and 107 million representing 67 million 14 million and 09 million shares respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations operating lease obligations and certain other commitments as of june 30 2020 these amounts do not reflect all planned spending under the various categories but rather that portion of spending to which we are contractually committed 



1 all debt obligations are based on their contractual face value excluding interest rate swap fair value adjustments and unamortized discounts 

2 variable interest rate commitments are based on the current contractual maturity date of the underlying facility calculated on the existing drawdown at june 30 2020 after allowing for increasesdecreases in projected bank reference rates 

3 we lease certain manufacturing sites office space warehouses land vehicles and equipment under operating leases the leases have varying terms escalation clauses and renewal rights not included in the above commitments are contingent rental payments which may arise as part of the rental increase indexed to the consumer price index or in the event that units produced by certain leased assets exceed a predetermined production capacity 

4 purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials utilities capital equipment and various other goods and services 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than as described under contractual obligations as of june 30 2020 we had no significant offbalance sheet contractual obligations or other commitments 

liquidity risk and outlook 

  in 2020 the company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market however our access was temporarily restricted in march both in the us and europe due to the impact from covid19 on financial markets we refinanced these maturities with drawings under our committed bank facilities as a precautionary measure to maximize liquidity in march 2020 we also extended our 364day syndicated facility by an additional six months to october 2020 while reducing the facility size from 10500 million to 8400 million this facility was canceled on june 29 2020 following the issuance of a 5000 million 10year senior unsecured note on june 19 2020 and a €5000 million 7year senior unsecured note on june 23 2020 the company also filed a form s3 shelf registration statement on june 10 2020 which enabled the company to issue the two notes in june 2020 and will enable the company to issue debt securities in the future when market conditions are favorable and on a timely basis 

  liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to financial liabilities we manage our liquidity risk centrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities due to the dynamic nature of our business we aim to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts bank loans corporate bonds unsecured notes commercial paper and factoring the following guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk 

• maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least 200 million that can be drawn at short notice 

• regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational investing and financing activities 

• generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets 

• maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency 

• managing credit risk related to financial assets 

• monitoring the duration of longterm debt 

• only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions and 

• to the extent practicable spreading the maturity dates of longterm debt facilities 

as of june 30 2020 and 2019 an aggregate principal amount of 19765 million and 2212 million respectively was drawn under our commercial paper programs however such programs are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities with maturities in april 2022 7500 million april 2023 15 billion and april 2024 15 billion with an option to extend under which we had 18 billion in unused capacity remaining as of june 30 2020 

we expect longterm future funding needs to primarily relate to refinancing and servicing our outstanding financial liabilities maturing as outlined above and to finance our growth capital expenditure and payments for acquisitions that may be completed we expect to continue to fund our longterm business needs on the same basis as in the past ie partially through the cash flow provided by operating activities available to the business and management of the capital of the business in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis we decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions individually based on among other factors the return on investment after related financing costs and the payback period of required upfront cash investments in light of our midterm liquidity planning covering a period of four years post the current financial year our longterm access to liquidity depends on both our results of operations and on the availability of funding in financial markets 

critical accounting estimates and judgments 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to retirement benefits intangible assets goodwill equity method investments and expected future performance of operations our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

• the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities 

• valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 

• calculation of deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 

• calculation of equity method investments and 

• calculation of acquisition fair values 

considerations related to the covid19 pandemic 

the impact that the recent covid19 pandemic will have on our consolidated operations is uncertain while the overall impact on our operations to date has not been material we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns we have considered the potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic in our critical accounting estimates and judgements as of june 30 2020 and will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact on our business and consolidated results of operations 

pension costs 

approximately 50 of our defined benefits plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals the accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states germany switzerland and the united kingdom net periodic pension cost recorded in fiscal year 2020 was 99 million compared to pension cost of 125 million in fiscal year 2019 and 77 million in fiscal year 2018 we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2021 to be approximately 127 million 

for our sponsored plans the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses salary inflation rates mortality rates and other assumptions we believe that the accounting estimates related to 

our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets actuarial valuations market conditions and contracted benefit changes the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation as well as independent studies of trends performed by our actuaries however actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions 

the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset in the case of an overfunded plan or as a liability in the case of an underfunded plan the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income pension plan liabilities are revalued annually or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straightline basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants the service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income the other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated statement of income separately from the service cost component and outside operating income 

we review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities the discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a highquality corporate bond yield curve derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable thirdparty indexes data providers and rating agencies in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate for mexico poland and turkey a corporate bond credit spread has been added to the government bond yields additionally the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future longterm return assumption for each individual asset class a single longterm return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plans target asset allocation 

pension assumptions sensitivity analysis 

the following chart depicts the sensitivity of estimated fiscal year 2021 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on assets 



intangible assets and goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired including intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential impairment all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit which is defined as an operating segment at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit we have six reporting units of which five are included in our flexibles segment the other reporting unit that is also a reporting segment is rigid packaging 

goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit adjusted for any tax benefits limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill 

in performing our impairment analysis we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative test is necessary if we determine that a quantitative test is necessary or elect to perform a quantitative test instead of the qualitative test we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using income approaches the most 

significant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units are the estimated net sales and earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization discount rate and terminal values 

our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts including undiscounted projected future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings adverse equity market conditions and other external events such as the covid19 pandemic may result in the need for more frequent assessments 

intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships technology trademarks and software and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives which range from one to 20 years we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows and discount rates these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events conditions and amounts of future cash flows 

deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 

we deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the determination of uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained on tax audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement significant estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit additionally we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income which might result in the need for a valuation allowance of deferred tax assets including operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards if we do not reach the more likely than not threshold based on all available evidence significant judgments and estimates including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the feasibility of tax planning strategies are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets if actual results differ from these estimates or there are future changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates we may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

equity accounted investments 

investments in ordinary shares of companies in which we believe we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method of accounting under this method the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and cash dividends paid the assessment of whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is otherthantemporary and the amount of such otherthantemporary decline requires significant estimates 

we review our investment in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable for example we tested our investment in amvig holdings limited amvig for impairment at march 31 2020 given that the quoted share price had experienced a significant decline in the month of march associated with general market declines due to the covid19 pandemic at the end of march we concluded that the decline was temporary and the investment was not impaired given our intention to hold the investment however the quoted share price did not recover in our fiscal fourth quarter and we determined that the investment was impaired as of june 30 2020 and recorded an impairment charge of 256 million we also recorded impairment charges of our amvig investment of 140 million in fiscal year 2019 and 365 million in fiscal year 2018 

acquisitions 

we record acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the purchase method of accounting we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquired business at their fair values as of the date of acquisition goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred also measured at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

we use all available information to estimate fair values and typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination for significant acquisitions the fair value measurements are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected cash flows from customer relationships acquired developed technology corporate trade name and brand names the period of time we expect to use the acquired intangible asset and discount rates 

in estimating the future cash flows we consider demand competition other economic factors and actuarial assumptions for defined benefit plans we utilize common valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and market approaches including the relieffromroyalty method to value acquired developed technology trade names and brand names customer relationships are valued using the cost approach or an income approach such as the excess earnings method we believe our estimates to be based on assumptions that are reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates which could result in impairment charges in the future 

in connection with a given business acquisition we may identify preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as part of the fair value estimates acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine the estimated amounts 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date we reevaluate these items quarterly based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period 

we account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business acquisition a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the liability is incurred we reflect acquired operations that we intend to dispose of as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of income and as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

overview 

our activities expose us to a variety of market risks and financial risks our overall risk management program seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks on amcors financial performance from time to time we enter into various derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts commodity fixed price swaps on behalf of customers and interest rate swaps to manage these risks our hedging activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard operating procedures and delegated authorities which provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing reporting these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the economic risk associated with movements in foreign exchange rates raw material prices and to fixed and variable interest rates but may not have been designated or qualify for hedge accounting under us gaap and hence may increase income statement volatility however we do not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in addition we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respective legal entitys functional currency to economically hedge foreign exchange risk in net investments in our non us subsidiaries which do not qualify for hedge accounting under us gaap and hence may increase income statement volatility 

there have been no material changes in the risks described below other than increased volatility in connection with the covid19 pandemic for the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 related to interest rate risk foreign exchange risk raw material and commodity price risk and credit risk 

interest rate risk 

our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt monitoring global interest rates and where appropriate hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps 

a hypothetical but reasonably possible increase of 1 in the floating rate on the relevant interest rate yield curve applicable to both derivative and nonderivative instruments denominated in us dollars the currency with the largest interest rate sensitivity outstanding as of june 30 2020 would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies of 171 million for the year ended june 30 2020 

foreign exchange risk 

we operate in over 40 countries across the world 

for the year ended june 30 2020 a hypothetical but reasonably possible adverse change of 1 in the underlying average foreign currency exchange rate for the euro would have resulted in an adverse impact on our net sales of 223 million 

during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 49 and 36 of our net sales respectively were effectively generated in us dollar functional currency entities during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 18 and 24 of net sales respectively were generated in euro functional currency entities with the remaining 33 and 40 of net sales respectively being generated in entities with functional currencies other than us dollars and euros the impact of translating euro and other nonus dollar net sales and operating expenses into us dollar for reporting purposes will vary depending on the movement of those currencies from period to period 

raw material and commodity price risk 

the primary raw materials for our products are resins film aluminum and liquids we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and are exposed to commodity price risk from a number of commodities and certain other raw materials and energy price risk 

changes in prices of our key raw materials and commodities including resins film aluminum inks solvents adhesives and liquids and other raw materials may result in a temporary or permanent reduction in income before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies depending on the level of recovery by material type the level of recovery depends both on the type of material and the market in which we operate across our business we have a number of contractual provisions that allow for passing on of raw material price fluctuations to customers within predefined periods 

a hypothetical but reasonably possible 1 increase on average prices for resins film aluminum and liquids not passed on to the customer by way of a price adjustment would have resulted in an increase in cost of sales and hence an 

adverse impact on income before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 of 569 million and 414 million respectively 

credit risk 

credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss we are exposed to credit risk arising from financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments as well as from overthecounter raw material and commodity related derivative instruments 

we manage our credit risk from balances with financial institutions through our counterparty risk policy which provide guidelines on setting limits to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigating financial loss through potential counterparty failure and on dealing and settlement procedures the investment of surplus funds is made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each specific counterparty financial derivative instruments can only be entered into with high credit quality approved financial institutions as of june 30 2020 and 2019 we did not have a significant concentration of credit risk in relation to derivatives entered into in accordance with our hedging and risk management activities

none 




 item 9a  controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of june 30 2020 the term disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including its principal executive and financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on this evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of june 30 2020 due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that was identified in our prospectus filed with the sec on march 25 2019 and is still being remediated as described below 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso framework 2013 

our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that 

• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in 

accordance with management and directors of the companys authorization and 

• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or 

disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations accordingly even effective internal controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

as previously described in part ii item 9a of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 we identified a material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end reporting process specifically we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key it systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information this control deficiency did not result in a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements however the control deficiency could have resulted in misstatements of our interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that may have not been prevented or detected on a timely basis 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2020 based on this evaluation our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2020 given a previously identified material weakness had not been remediated as of fiscal 2020 year end 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2020 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers ag an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears on item 8  financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

plan for remediation of material weakness 

we are currently in the process of remediating the material weakness related to deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over period end reporting through a process to i develop and implement additional controls and procedures to reduce the number of segregation of duties conflicts within key it systems which includes the implementation of new security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitoring where practical ii design and implement additional compensating controls where necessary and iii develop training on segregation of duties given we operate many erp systems globally this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in fiscal 2021 these enhanced processes including the implementation of new mitigating controls will effectively remediate the material weakness but the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded through testing they are designed and operating effectively we currently expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed by the end of fiscal 2021 however there is no assurance that the material weakness will be fully remediated by the end of fiscal 2021 as the severity and length of the 2019 novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic is unknown and the remediation timeline could be negatively impacted because of inefficiencies caused by covid19 limitations on travel meetings and onsite work 

completed remediation of previously reported material weakness 

as previously described in part ii item 9a of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 we identified a material weakness related to a lack of experience in technical accounting in us gaap and us domestic registrant filing requirements since the material weakness has been identified we have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes and to remediate the material weakness we have hired additional financial reporting personnel with us gaap technical accounting and financial reporting experience as well as us domestic registrant filing experience aligned our accounting policies and procedures with us gaap enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process with us gaap experienced staff and have conducted technical training for accounting and finance personnel during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented steps and found them to be effective as a result we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of june 30 2020 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except as described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 the amcor way describes the capabilities deployed consistently across amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio talent commercial excellence operational leadership innovation and cash and capital discipline 

shareholder value creation 

through our portfolio of business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value the defensive nature of our end markets mean that yeartoyear volatility should be relatively low measured on a constant currency basis through paying dividends and growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets pursuing acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders over time value creation has been strong and consistent 

segment information 

accounting standards codification asc 280 segment reporting establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements in applying the criteria set forth in asc 280 the company has determined it has two reporting segments flexibles and rigid packaging the reporting segments produce flexible packaging rigid packaging specialty cartons and closure products which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout europe north america latin america africa and the asia pacific regions refer to note 20   segments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about business segments 

flexibles segment 

the flexibles segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally with approximately 43000  employees at 190  facilities in 38  countries as of june 30 2019  the flexibles segment is one of the worlds largest suppliers of plastic aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging in fiscal year 2019  flexibles accounted for approximately 70  of the company’s consolidated net sales 

rigid packaging segment 

the rigid packaging segment is one of the worlds largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and related products as of june 30 2019  the rigid packaging segment employed approximately 6000  employees at 60  facilities in 12  countries in fiscal year 2019  rigid packaging accounted for approximately 30  of the company’s consolidated net sales 

marketing distribution and competition 

our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels but primarily through our direct sales force sales offices and plants are located throughout europe north america latin america africa and asiapacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers design technicians field service technicians and a customer service organization 

sales to pepsico and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 111 110 and 117 of our sales in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively business arrangements with pepsico are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time 

 the major markets in which we sell our products historically have been and continue to be highly competitive areas of competition include service innovation quality and price competitors include aptar group inc ball corporation berry global inc ccl industries inc crown holdings incorporated graphic packaging international inc huhtamaki oyj international paper company mayrmelnhof karton ag owensillinois inc sealed air corporation silgan holdings inc sonoco products company westrock company winpack ltd and a variety of privately held companies 

we consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we serve however due to the diversity of our business our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable 

backlog 

working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions we maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate 

raw materials 

polymer resins and films paper inks adhesives aluminum and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use these are purchased from a variety of global industry sources and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials while temporary industrywide shortages of raw materials may occur we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions currently raw materials are readily available but pricing can fluctuate 

intellectual property 

we are the owner or licensee of a number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to certain of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the united states and in foreign countries we also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets our patents licenses and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage however the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results as a whole or those of our segments 

environmental matters and government regulation 

we believe our commitment to responsible packaging is integral to our success responsible packaging protects the product extends its shelf life and can reduce a significant amount of waste throughout the supply chain 

in january 2018 we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025 to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging 

our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions these laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of certain materials into the environment handling and disposition of waste and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as various other protections of the environment we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our environmental health and safety management system and regular audits of those processes and systems however we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or the offsite disposal of regulated materials which could be material in addition these laws and regulations are constantly changing and we cannot always anticipate these changes refer to note 19   contingencies and legal proceedings  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors 

employees 

as of june 30 2019  we employed approximately 50000  people worldwide

 item 1a  risk factors 

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10k or in other filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission could adversely affect the companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also effect our business operations and financial results 

strategic risks 

changes in consumer demand — we are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries 

  sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers consequently changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered whether as a result of changes in cost convenience or health environmental and social concerns and perceptions may result in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products although we have adopted certain strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining sales there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand furthermore any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to accurately predict customer demand end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and costeffective manner 

changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce however to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand for new or alternative products changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

key customers and customer consolidation — the loss of key customers a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability 

relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to customers from time to time a single customer depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations may account for 10 or more of our revenue sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately 11 of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 we did not have any other customer account for more than 10 of net sales in these fiscal periods 

customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units consequently the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production requirements or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them could reduce our sales revenue and net profit 

there can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors change to alternative forms of packaging begin manufacturing their packaging products inhouse or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before 

any loss change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

in addition over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines this consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired while we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition — we face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business 

we operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas each with varying barriers to entry industry structures and competitive behavior we regularly bid for new and continuing business in the industries and regions in which 

we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand we cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness 

the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may have a significant impact on our operating results in addition our competitors may develop disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers no assurance can be given that the actions of established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

synergy benefits — the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of bemis 

we anticipate that the transaction will generate estimated pretax annual net cost synergies by the end of the third year of approximately 180 million from procurement manufacturing and general and administrative efficiencies however we must successfully integrate our businesses in a manner that permits these anticipated benefits to be realized if we are not able to successfully achieve this the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected or involve more costs to do so 

integration risk — the failure to successfully integrate the business and operations of bemis in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results 

historically amcor limited and bemis were independent companies while we have dedicated teams working on integrating our two operations there can be no assurance that our businesses will be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the loss of customers the disruption of either or both companies’ ongoing businesses unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated specifically the following issues among others must be addressed in integrating our operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction 

 

in addition at times the attention of certain members of our company and resources may be focused on the integration of the business and diverted from daytoday business operations which may disrupt our business 

expanding our current business — we may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth including by product innovation or acquisitions 

our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in emerging markets product innovation and expansion through acquisitions however we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control our ability to grow organically may be limited by among other things extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions strategic priorities or otherwise for many of our businesses organic growth depends on product innovation new product development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences consequently failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential affect our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

additionally over the past decade we have pursued growth through acquisitions including our recent transaction with bemis company inc there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions in the future and with the right participation strategy or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all other companies in the industries and regions in which we operate have similar investment and acquisition strategies to us resulting in competition for a limited pool of potential acquisition targets due in part to that competition as well as the recent low interest rate environment which has made debt funding more appealing and accessible price multiples for potential targets are currently higher than their historical averages if as a result of these and other factors we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting 

expected financial benefits 

intellectual property — challenges to or the loss of our intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property we own a number of patents on our products aspects of our products methods of use andor methods of manufacturing and we own or have licenses to use the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products we also rely on trade secrets knowhow and other unpatented proprietary technology we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us furthermore many of the countries in which we operate particularly the emerging markets do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in which we operate such as the united states and the european union the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce certain of our competitive advantages cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business similarly while we have not received any significant claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will not receive such claims in the future if we were held liable for a claim of infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all failure to protect our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

operational risks 

global operations — challenging current and future global economic conditions have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business operations and financial results 

demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products including packaged food beverage healthcare personal care agribusiness industrial and other consumer goods as a result general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results the current global economic challenges including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate low economic growth and difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and related economic volatility in certain economies are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our business in addition we have recently experienced challenging conditions in parts of south america where economic conditions have been mixed and in particular in argentina where we have employed highly inflationary accounting for our local subsidiaries 

when challenging economic conditions exist our customers may delay decrease or cancel purchases from us and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers which may affect our ability to meet customer demands and result in a loss of business weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins all of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate for example the formal process for the united kingdom leaving the european union has resulted in uncertainty 

regarding the longterm nature of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union causing significant volatility in global financial markets and altering the conduct of market participants political developments such as this could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and may cause us to lose customers suppliers and employees and adversely impact profitability 

international operations — our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results 

we have operations throughout the world including facilities located in emerging markets in fiscal year 2019 approximately 70 of our sales revenue came from developed markets and 30 came from emerging markets we expect to continue to expand our operations in the future particularly in the emerging markets 

management of global operations is extremely complex particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural political and regulatory environments of the countries in which we operate in addition many of the countries in which we operate including argentina brazil china and india and other emerging markets have underdeveloped or developing legal regulatory or political systems which are subject to dynamic change and civil unrest 

the profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by among other things 

 

further sustained periods of legal regulatory or political instability in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

the international scope of our operations which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to certain economic sanctions administered by the us office of foreign assets control the us department of state the australian department of foreign affairs and trade and other applicable national and supranational organizations collectively ‘‘sanctions’’ and operations in certain countries that are from time to time subject to sanctions also requires us to maintain internal processes and control procedures failure to do so could result in breach by our employees of various laws and regulations including those relating to money laundering corruption export control fraud bribery insider trading antitrust competition and economic sanctions whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise any such breach could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result in reputational damage to our business which effect may be material 

raw materials — price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business 

as a manufacturer of packaging products our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and other inputs including energy all of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films aluminum and fiberbased carton board prices for these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions currency and commodity price fluctuations resource availability transportation costs weather conditions and natural disasters political unrest and instability and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures increases in costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies including by entering into contracts with certain customers which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increases in raw material costs there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements there may be delays in adjusting prices to correspond with underlying raw material costs and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

supply shortages or disruptions in our supply chains including as a result of sourcing materials from a single supplier could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of raw materials equipment and other supplies and in turn adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

commercial risks — we are subject to production supply and other commercial risks including counterparty credit risks which may be exacerbated in times of economic downturn 

we face a number of commercial risks including i operational disruption such as mechanical or technology failures each of which could in turn lead to production loss andor increased costs ii shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers and iii risks associated with development projects such as cost overruns and delays in addition many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters including earthquakes snow storms hurricanes forest fires and flooding any unplanned plant downtime at any of our facilities would likely result in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime 

additionally the insolvency of or contractual default by any of our customers suppliers and financial institutions such as banks and insurance providers may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition such risks are exacerbated in times of economic volatility either globally or in the geographies and industries in which our customers operate if a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts may need to be written off if a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project we may need to find a replacement to fulfill that party’s obligations or alternatively fulfill those obligations ourself which is likely to be more expensive the occurrence of any of these risks including any default by our counterparties could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage 

information technology — a failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations compromise customer employee vendor and other data and could negatively effect our business 

we rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and various business functions and on various technologies to process store and report information about our business and to interact with customers vendors and employees around the world in addition our information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures these measures cover technical changes to our network security organization and governance changes as well as alignment of third party vendors on market standards as with all large systems our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruption information loss or shutdown due to power outages failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software hardware failures computer viruses cyberattacks catastrophic events telecommunications failures user errors unauthorized access and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functionality 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches misplaced or lost data and programming andor user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information information system damages disruptions shutdowns or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions transaction errors loss of customers and business opportunities violation of privacy laws and legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention negative publicity resulting in reputational damage reimbursement or compensatory payments and other costs any of which could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which affect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

attracting and retaining key personnel — if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be adversely affected 

our continued success depends in large part on our ability to identify attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel in key functions and geographic areas losing the services of key employees in any of our operations could make it difficult to meet our objectives there can be no assurance we will be able to recruit train assimilate motivate and retain employees in the future who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture 

operational hazards — we are subject to costs and liabilities related to current and future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 

we are required to comply with environmental and health and safety laws rules and regulations in each of the countries in which we do business many of our products come into contact with the food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditure of financial and employee resources 

in addition changes to such laws regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly and some of the proposals if adopted might directly or indirectly result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units for instance an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials additionally increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change including greenhouse gas carbon emissions and other climaterelated regulations could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices increased cost of fossil fuel inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs however any such changes are uncertain and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance 

federal state provincial foreign and local environmental requirements relating to air soil and water quality handling discharge storage and disposal of a variety of substances and climate change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operations we may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is or was contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own used or operate including facilities that may be acquired by us in the future legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties as well as mandated remediation programs that require substantial and in some instances unplanned capital expenditure 

the effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may adversely affect our business a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating introducing regulatory change to address the impacts of climate change which where implemented may have adverse impacts on our operations or financial results 

we have incurred in the past and may incur in the future fines penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters and costs relating to the damage of natural resources lost property values and toxic tort claims provisions are raised when it is considered probable that we have some liability however because the extent of potential environmental damage and the extent of our liability for such damage is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently provisioned amount accordingly additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position which may be material 

labor disputes — we are subject to the risk of labor disputes which could adversely affect our business 

although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disputes in the future including protests and strikes which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation although we consider our relations with our employees to be good there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future 

financial risks 

libor indexed borrowings — our financing agreements may need to be renegotiated if libor ceases to exist 

a substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities 

certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for libor if necessary however if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate some financing agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize 

libor as a factor in determining the interest rate we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate however we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021 whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business financial condition and results of operations 

exchange rates — we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk both transactional and translational which may negatively affect our financial performance transactional foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations including in respect of the us dollar the euro the brazilian real and other currencies in which our costs are denominated which may affect our business input costs and proceeds from product sales translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity functional currencies to us dollars consistent with our reporting currency and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and expenses in particular our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the exchange rate between the euro and the brazilian real against the us dollar the exchange rate has varied in recent years and is subject to further movement 

exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly for instance the peso the real the ruble and the yuan have experienced significant pressures as growth and other concerns have weighed on the argentine brazilian russian and chinese economies respectively to the extent currency depreciation continues across our business we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through us dollardenominated input costs across our business which would adversely impact our margins and profitability as such we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 

interest rates — an increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations 

at june 30 2019 our variable rate borrowings approximated 40 billion which includes 8410 million fixed rate notes that have been effectively converted to variable rate debt through the use of a fixed to variable interest rate swap fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations accordingly increases in shortterm interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay for each one percent increase in variable interest rates our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 400 million on the 40 billion of variable rate debt outstanding as of june 30 2019 

credit rating — a downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to using cash provided by operations we regularly issue commercial paper to meet our shortterm liquidity needs our credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest a downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing or the fees associated with our bank credit facility or the credit spread incurred when issuing longterm debt in the capital markets 

hedging — failure to hedge effectively against adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations 

we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates associated with borrowing on a floatingrate basis as well as unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our board of directors has approved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates the level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time and we may elect to change our hedging policy at any time if our hedges are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risks if we are underhedged or if a hedge provider defaults on our obligations under hedging arrangements it could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets — a significant writedown of goodwill andor other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth 

we review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards these methods include the use of a weightedaverage cost of capital to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows or other factors may cause our goodwill andor other intangible assets to be impaired resulting in a noncash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment in addition if we make changes in 

our business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results if a significant write down is required the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth we have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting estimates and judgments—intangible assets and goodwill” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

financial controls and reporting systems — significant demands will be placed on our financial controls and reporting systems as a result of the acquisition of bemis 

there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with our acquisition of bemis and significant demands will be placed on our managerial operational and financial personnel and systems our future operating results may be affected by the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement expand and revise our operational and financial controls and reporting systems in response to the transaction for example while bemis prepared its financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we have historically prepared our financial statements in accordance with australian accounting standards aas and the combined company will now prepare financial statements in accordance with us gaap the revisions required to consolidate the financial reporting system and to switch reporting systems to us gaap has placed significant demands on our financial controls and reporting systems 

furthermore we are required to comply with different rules and regulations from those that previously applied to us including the rules and regulations of the sec the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the listed rules of the new york stock exchange and the application of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sarbanesoxley act complying with the applicable rules and regulations has and will result in an increase in legal and financial compliance costs and also has made certain activities more timeconsuming and costly 

  

internal controls — if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition results of operations or cash flows which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and as a result the value of our common stock 

as a newly listed nyse public company we have elected the transition period for compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act section 404 requires us to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting this assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting however during our transition period we are exempted from compliance with section 404 we are exempt from section 404 compliance until we file our second annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

amcor limited was required to comply with reporting obligations in australia including the preparation of its financial statements under aas as adopted by the australian accounting standards board and other relevant companies law amcor limited was not required to comply with us gaap following the consummation of the bemis acquisition we now prepare financial statements in accordance with us gaap we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical aas financial statements to us gaap the first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting in us gaap and disclosure and filing requirements of a us domestic registrant we are currently in the process of remediating this material weakness and have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes of the material weakness we have hired additional financial reporting personnel with us gaap technical accounting and financial reporting experience aligned our accounting policies and procedures with us gaap enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process and begun technical training for accounting and finance personnel 

we also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end financial reporting process specifically we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key it systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information 

to address the second material weakness we have commenced a process to i identify those internal controls requiring improved documentation of independent review over the completeness and accuracy of financial information under us gaap ii implement enhanced standards designed to meet the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act iii review the design of applicable internal controls and assess any required amendments and iv increase the training of accounting and finance staff in relevant areas 

we believe that these enhanced resources and processes including the implementation of new mitigating controls will effectively remediate the material weaknesses but the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded through testing that these controls are designed and operating effectively if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section 404 at the end of our transition period or if we or our registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control that are deemed to be material weaknesses the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources 

  

insurance — our insurance policies including our use of a captive insurance company may not provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face 

we seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance a significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance market with thirdparty reinsurers our policies with such thirdparty reinsurers cover property damage and business interruption public and products liability and directors and officers liability although amcor believes the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no guarantee that any claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid 

additionally amcor retains a portion of amcors insurable risk through a captive insurance company amcor insurances pte ltd which is located in singapore amcors captive insurance company collects annual premiums from amcors business groups and assumes specific risks relating to property damage business interruption and liability claims the captive insurance company may be required to make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captives reserves which could have an adverse effect on amcors business cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

legal and compliance risks 

litigation — litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are and in the future will likely become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business given our global footprint we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments see “legal proceedings included in item 3 of this annual report on form 10k 

environmental health and safety regulations — changing government regulations in environmental health and safety matters may adversely affect our company 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost as well as energy and freight costs it is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits additionally a sizable portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging both highly regulated markets if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

patents and proprietary technology — our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to develop acquire and retain intellectual property rights 

our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology we rely on intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may suffer our pending 

patent applications and our pending trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks in addition our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues 

risks relating to being a jersey channel islands company listing ordinary shares 

our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of jersey channel islands which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a us jurisdiction and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other us corporations 

we are organized under the laws of jersey channel islands a british crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of normandy france jersey is not a member of the european union jersey channel islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on english corporate law principles the rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by jersey law including the companies jersey law 1991 as amended and by the amcor articles of association these rights differ in some respects from the rights of other shareholders in corporations incorporated in the united states further there can be no assurance that the laws of jersey channel islands will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the us which could adversely affect the rights of investors 

us shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us 

a significant portion of our assets are located outside of the united states and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of jurisdictions outside of the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service within the united states upon those directors and officers or to realize in the united states upon judgments of courts of the united states predicated upon our civil liability and our directors or officers under the us federal securities laws 

judgments of us courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the us and the enforcement of judgments of us courts outside of the us including those in australia and jersey may be subject to limitations investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the us including australia and jersey for liabilities under the securities laws of the us additionally our articles of association provide that while the royal court of jersey will have nonexclusive jurisdiction over actions brought against us the royal court of jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions actions for breach of fiduciary duty by our directors and officers actions arising out of jersey companies law or actions asserting a claim against our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine the exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under us federal securities laws from being raised in a us court and would not prevent a us court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims however there is uncertainty whether a us or jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for actions for breach of fiduciary duty and other claims

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities borrowings from banks and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity we periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions expected future cash flows potential funding requirements for debt refinancing capital expenditures and acquisitions the cost of capital sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings and our ease of access to funding sources based on our current cash flow from operating activities and available cash we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities together with borrowings available under our credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations capital expenditures and other commitments 

overview

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash inflows provided by operating activities decreased by 953 million or 109 to 7761 million for fiscal year 2019 from 8714 million for fiscal year 2018 this decrease was primarily driven by bemis transaction related costs partially offset by working capital improvements 

net cash inflows provided by operating activities decreased by 375 million or 41 to 8714 million for fiscal year 2018 this decrease was primarily due to a cash outflow in working capital of 1225 million in 2018 compared to a cash outflow of 510 million in fiscal year 2017 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash inflows provided by investing activities increased by 2521 million or 1042 to 102 million for fiscal year 2019 from net cash outflows used by investing activities of 2419 million for fiscal year 2018 this increase was from proceeds from sale of affiliated companies and subsidiaries of 2163 million which primarily related to the cash proceeds of the us remedy 

capital expenditures were 3322 million for fiscal year 2019 a decrease of 328 million compared to 3650 million for fiscal year 2018 the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily the result of general capital expenditure decreases across both the flexibles and rigid packaging segments 

net cash outflows used in investing activities decreased by 3901 million or 617 to 2419 million for fiscal year 2018 from 6320 million for fiscal year 2017 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payments for acquisitions of 

businesses 00 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to 3356 million in fiscal year 2017 in addition to higher proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment and other intangible assets 1370 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to 829 million in fiscal year 2017

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash flows used in financing activities increased by 2222 million or 409 to 7649 million for fiscal year 2019  from 5427 million for fiscal year 2018 this increase was primarily due the repayment of longterm debt offset by the proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt 

net cash flows used in financing activities increased by 3197 million or 1434 to 5427 million for fiscal year 2018 from 2230 million for fiscal year 2017 this increase was primarily due to repayments of longterm debt increasing to 47 billion in 2018 compared to 37 billion in 2017 net proceeds from borrowings increasing to 45 billion in 2018 compared to 40 billion in 2017 and dividend payments increasing from 4891 million in 2017 to 5268 million in 2018 partially offset by the increase in shortterm debt borrowings from 1140 million in 2017 to 1554 million in 2018 

net debt 

we borrow money from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts bank loans corporate bonds unsecured notes and commercial paper we have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings 

shortterm debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the shortterm nature of the borrowings except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months the current portion of the longterm debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date 

our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to a range between 75 to 150 of our total tangible assets subject to some exceptions and variations by facility in addition the bank debt facilities and us private placement debt require us to comply with certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage ratios the negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements as of june 30 2019  we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities and us private placement debt 

our net debt as of june 30 2019  and june 30 2018  was 55 billion  and 42 billion  respectively with the change being primarily due to the bemis acquisition

as of june 30 2019  we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of 27 billion our senior facilities are available to fund working capital growth capital expenditures and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by five separate bank syndicates as of june 30 2019  the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of 56 billion of which 29 billion had been drawn inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities our senior facilities mature between fiscal years 2020 and 2024 

dividend payments 

in fiscal years 2019 2018  and 2017  we paid 6797 million  5268 million  and 4891 million  respectively in dividends 

credit rating 

our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies these credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest for various tenors and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid including european and us debt capital markets and from global financial institutions 

share repurchases 

we had cash outflows of 202 million  357 million  and 402 million  for the purchase of our shares in the open market during fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017  respectively as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of sharebased compensation awards as of june 30 2019  2018  and 2017  we held treasury shares at cost of 161 million  107 million  and 81 million  representing 14 million  09 million  and 07 million  shares respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations operating lease obligations and certain other commitments as of june 30 2019 these amounts do not reflect all planned spending under the various categories but rather that portion of spending to which we are contractually committed 



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than as described under contractual obligations as of june 30 2019  we had no significant offbalance sheet contractual obligations or other commitments 

liquidity risk and outlook 

liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to financial liabilities we manage our liquidity risk centrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities due to the dynamic nature of our business we aim to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts bank loans corporate bonds unsecured notes commercial paper and factoring the following guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk 



 

as of june 30 2019 and 2018 an aggregate principal amount of 2213 million and 7595 million respectively was drawn under these commercial paper programs however such programs are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities with maturities in april 2022 7500 million april 2023 15 billion and april 2024 15 billion under which we had 22 billion in unused capacity remaining as of june 30 2019 

we expect longterm future funding needs to primarily relate to refinancing and servicing our outstanding financial liabilities maturing as outlined above and to finance our growth capital expenditure and payments for acquisitions that may be completed we expect to continue to fund our longterm business needs on the same basis as in the past ie partially through the cash flow provided by operating activities available to the business and management of the capital of the business in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis we decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions individually based on among other factors the return on investment after related financing costs and the payback period of required upfront cash investments in light of our midterm liquidity planning covering a period of four years post the current financial year our longterm access to liquidity depends on both our results of operations and on the availability of funding in domestic and international financial markets 

critical accounting estimates and judgments 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to retirement benefits intangible assets goodwill and expected future performance of operations our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

pension costs 

approximately 50 of our defined benefits plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals the accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states germany switzerland and the united kingdom net periodic pension cost recorded in fiscal year 2019 was 125 million compared to pension cost of 77 million in fiscal year 2018 and 802 million in fiscal year 2017 we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2020 to be approximately 63 million 

for our sponsored plans the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses salary inflation rates mortality rates and other assumptions we believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets actuarial valuations market conditions and contracted benefit changes the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation as well as 

independent studies of trends performed by our actuaries however actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions 

the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset in the case of an overfunded plan or as a liability in the case of an underfunded plan the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income pension plan liabilities are revalued annually or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straightline basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants the service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income the other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated income statements separately from the service cost component and outside operating income 

we review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities the discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a highquality corporate bond yield curve derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable thirdparty indexes data providers and rating agencies in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate for mexico poland and turkey a corporate bond credit spread has been added to the government bond yields additionally the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future longterm return assumption for each individual asset class a single longterm return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plans target asset allocation 

pension assumptions sensitivity analysis 

the following chart depicts the sensitivity of estimated fiscal year 2020 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on assets 



  

intangible assets and goodwill 

the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets identifiable intangible assets liabilities assumed and goodwill determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and asset group and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 

goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired including intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential impairment all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit which is defined as an operating segment at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit we have five reporting units of which four are included in our flexible packaging reporting segment the other reporting segment is rigid packaging 

goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year we elected to early adopt the accounting standards update 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment in fiscal year 2017 as a result of this election if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would recognize an impairment loss 

equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit adjusted for any tax benefits limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill 

our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts including undiscounted projected future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings adverse equity market conditions and other external events may require more frequent assessments 

intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships technology trademarks and software and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives which range from one to 20 years we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows and discount rates these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events condition and amounts of future cash flows 

deferred taxes 

we deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the determination of uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained on tax audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement significant estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit additionally we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income which might result in the need for a valuation allowance of deferred tax assets including operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards if we do not reach the more likely than not threshold based on all available evidence significant judgments and estimates including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the feasibility of tax planning strategies are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets if actual results differ from these estimates or there are future changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates we may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

equity accounted investments 

investments in ordinary shares of companies in which we believe we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method of accounting under this method the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and cash dividends paid the assessment of whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is otherthantemporary and the amount of such otherthantemporary decline requires significant estimates 

we review our investment in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable there was a prolonged and significant decline in amvigs quoted share price during the year ended june 30 2019 and 2018 we determined these prolonged declines were other than temporary impairments of our investment in amvig accordingly we recorded impairments of 140 million and 365 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

overview 

our activities expose us to a variety of market risks and financial risks our overall risk management program seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks on its financial performance from time to time we enter into various derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts commodity fixed price swaps on behalf of customers and interest rate swaps to manage these risks our hedging activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard 

operating procedures and delegated authorities which provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing reporting these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the economic risk associated with movements in foreign exchange rates raw material prices and to fixed and variable interest rates but may not have been designated or qualify for hedge accounting under us gaap and hence may increase income statement volatility however we do not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes in addition we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respective legal entitys functional currency to economically hedge foreign exchange risk in net investments in foreign subsidiaries which do not qualify for hedge accounting under us gaap and hence may increase income statement volatility 

there have been no material changes in the risks described below for the fiscal years 2019 and 2018  related to interest rate risk foreign exchange risk raw material and commodity price risk and credit risk 

interest rate risk 

our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt monitoring global interest rates and where appropriate hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges so the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense 

a hypothetical but reasonably possible increase of 1 in the floating rate on the relevant interest rate yield curve applicable to both derivative and nonderivative instruments denominated in us dollars the currency with the largest interest rate sensitivity outstanding as of june 30 2019  would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies of 170 million for the year ended june 30 2019  

foreign exchange risk 

we operate in over 40 countries across the world 

for the year ended june 30 2019  a hypothetical but reasonably possible adverse change of 1 in the underlying average foreign currency exchange rate for the euro would have resulted in an adverse impact on our net sales of 229 million 

in fiscal years 2019 and 2018  36 and 33 of our net sales respectively were effectively generated in us dollar functional currency entities for the same years 24 and 26 of net sales respectively were generated in euro functional currency entities with the remaining 40 and 41 of net sales respectively being generated in entities with functional currencies other than us dollars and euros the impact of translating euro and other nonus dollar net sales and operating expenses into us dollar for reporting purposes will vary depending on the movement of those currencies from period to period 

raw material and commodity price risk 

the primary raw materials for our products are resins film aluminum and liquids we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and are exposed to commodity price risk from a number of commodities and certain other raw materials and energy price risk 

changes in prices of our key raw materials and commodities including resins film aluminum and liquids and other raw materials may result in a temporary or permanent reduction in income before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies depending on the level of recovery by material type the level of recovery depends both on the type of material and the market in which we operate across our business we have a number of contract provisions that allow for passing on of raw material price fluctuations to customers within contractually predefined periods 

a hypothetical but reasonably possible 1 increase on average prices for resins film aluminum and liquids not passed on to the customer by way of a price adjustment would have resulted in an increase in cost of sales and hence an adverse impact on income before income taxes and equity in income loss of affiliated companies for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  of 414 million and 437 million respectively 

credit risk 

credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss we are exposed to credit risk arising from financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions foreign 

exchange transactions and other financial instruments as well as from overthecounter raw material and commodity related derivative instruments 

we manage our credit risk from balances with financial institutions through standard operating procedures which provide guidelines on setting limits to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigating financial loss through potential counterparty failure and on dealing and settlement procedures the investment of surplus funds is made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each specific counterparty financial derivative instruments can only be entered into with high credit quality approved financial institutions with a minimum longterm credit rating of a or better by standard  poors as of june 30 2019  and 2018  we did not have a significant concentration of credit risk in relation to derivatives entered into in accordance with our hedging and risk management activities 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the information required by this item 7a is included in note 11   derivative instruments  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and under the caption quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is part of management’s discussion and analysis included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 9  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a  controls and procedures 

as disclosed in our prospectus filed with the sec on march 25 2019 during the course of preparing for our initial public offering we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical aas financial statements to us gaap the first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting in us gaap and disclosure and filing requirements of a us domestic registrant we are currently in the process of remediating this material weakness and have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes of the material weakness we have hired additional financial reporting personnel with us gaap technical accounting and financial reporting experience aligned our accounting policies and procedures with us gaap enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process and begun technical training for accounting and finance personnel 

we also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end reporting process specifically we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key it systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information we are currently in the process of remediating this material weakness by commencing a process to i identify those internal controls requiring improved documentation of independent review over the completeness and accuracy of financial information under us gaap ii implement enhanced standards designed to meet the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act iii review the design of applicable internal controls and assess any required amendments and iv increase the training of accounting and finance staff in relevant areas 

we believe that these enhanced resources and processes including the implementation of new mitigating controls will effectively remediate the material weaknesses but the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded through testing that these controls are designed and operating effectively 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of june 30 2019 the term disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including its principal executive and financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as discussed above related to our internal controls over financial reporting we have made significant progress in our remediation efforts but the remediation of these material weaknesses will not be evaluated until management performs its assessment of internal controls at which time the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively therefore as a result of these material weaknesses our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of june 30 2019
