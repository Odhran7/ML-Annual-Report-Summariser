in addition to these federal laws and regulations various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes and have authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites and are currently under the state’s licensed site remediation professional program as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site and in 2008 the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the usepa to complete a remedial investigationfeasibility study in 2018 the usepa issued a record of decision setting forth the scope of required remediation work at the site which includes upgrading a water treatment plant to address constituents such as chlorinated organic compounds 14dioxane and perfluorooctanoic acidperfluorooctane sulfonate pfoapfos in 2020 the court approved a consent decree that requires the company and another responsible party to finance and perform the required remediation work with usepa oversight 

in 2011 our life technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the usepa and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former davis landfill superfund site in smithfield rhode island after years of additional study in september 2020 usepa revised its cleanup plan by selecting an interim remedial approach that includes groundwater treatment followed by additional monitoring of site conditions depending on the results of these treatment and monitoring activities over the next several years usepa anticipates selecting a final groundwater remedy for the site in november 2021 the 2011 consent decree was amended to reflect the parties’ obligations to implement usepa’s interim remedy 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 65 million at december 31 2021 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that the company’s operations products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements – commitments and contingencies

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could also result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in item 1 business under the caption “forwardlooking statements” 

industry and economic risks 

our growth would suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets would diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate our business is affected by general economic conditions both inside and outside the us if the global economy and financial markets or economic conditions in europe the us or other key markets continue to be unstable including as a result of the covid19 pandemic it could adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers distributors and suppliers having the effect of 

• reducing demand for some of our products 

• increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays 

• increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

• increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services 

• causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products and 

• creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2021 currency translation had a favorable effect of 619 million on revenues due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of global and local political legal regulatory and financial instability including issues of geopolitical relations the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions andor sovereign debt issues and may have a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices as a result of these and other factors our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful and growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable 

in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers 

• changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions 

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships including new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers 

• tariffs imposed by the us on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods including the tariffs adopted by the us government on various imports from china and by the chinese government on certain us goods

risk factors continued 

• the impact of public health epidemicspandemics on the global economy such as the covid19 pandemic 

• uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable 

• the imposition of governmental controls 

• diverse data privacy and protection requirements 

• supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products 

• negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

• the effects of the uks departure from the eu known as brexit and 

• geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil including terrorism and war 

demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 

spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget an impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending 

we are subject to risks associated with public health crises and epidemicspandemics such as the covid19 pandemic our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemicspandemics such as covid19 the global spread of covid19 has created significant volatility uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption resulting in an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration 

covid19 has had an adverse impact on certain of our operations supply chains and distribution systems including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking national state and local governments have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions including quarantines border closures increased border controls travel restrictions shelter in place orders and shutdowns and other measures these measures may disrupt normal business operations and may have significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide 

the company has mobilized to support the covid19 response with products and services that help diagnose the virus as well as assisting customers to develop therapeutics and vaccines used to protect from the virus our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees the ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 while we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees these measures may not be successful and we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures while we are staying in close communication with our sites employees customers and suppliers and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation the duration and extent of the effect of covid19 on the company is not determinable 

in addition several of the company’s businesses have had an increase in revenues due to sales of products addressing diagnosis and treatment of covid19 while these positive impacts are expected to continue into 2022 the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand 

business risks 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards competitive factors include technological innovation price service and delivery breadth of product line customer support ebusiness

risk factors continued 

capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenues and operating results would suffer 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenues 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

• strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets 

• allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects 

• developing new applications for our technologies 

• expanding our service offerings 

• continuing key customer initiatives 

• combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively 

• finding new markets for our products and 

• continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support crossselling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings 

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business 

because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

integrating ppd into our business may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized the success of the ppd acquisition including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings depends in part on our ability to successfully integrate ppd into our business the integration is a difficult costly and timeconsuming process it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of our ongoing business or that the alignment of standards controls procedures and policies may adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients customers suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction the loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which ppd now operates which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the ppd acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and our business may be unable to grow as planned which could materially impact our business cash flow financial condition or results of operations as well as adversely impact our share price the integration process may also result in significant expenses and charges both cash and noncash 

our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals as well as disputes or litigation any

acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 4192 billion and 124 billion respectively as of december 31 2021 in addition we have definitelived intangible assets totaling 1888 billion as of december 31 2021 we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired we assess the realizability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

operational risks 

our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance regulatory requirements cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues such as covid19 war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also rely on our information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as interacting with suppliers selling our products and services fulfilling orders and billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers tracking customer activity fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer hackers computer viruses ransomware phishing computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture any of the cyberattacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above if significant could materially interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the us individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe and the eu general data protection regulation imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data several countries such as china and russia have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

we may have difficulty attracting and retaining a highly qualified workforce our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific technical clinical and management workforce in a highly competitive environment qualified individuals are in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract them we may face difficulty in attracting and retaining key talent for a number of reasons including management changes or recruitment by competitors our ability to attract and retain key talent also depends in part on how well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees we cannot ensure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our operations or that the loss of any personnel will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flows our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins and steel while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

natural disasters public health crises political crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend and could impact customer spending we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk an earthquake or other natural disaster such as a fire or hurricane or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control such as strikes or other labor unrest could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if any of our facilities including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities or the facilities of our suppliers thirdparty service providers or customers is affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis power shortages or outages floods or monsoons public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics political crises such as terrorism war political instability or other conflict or other events outside of our control such as trade protectionism strikes or other labor unrest our results of operations could be adversely affected moreover these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity globally which could also adversely impact our operating results 

increasing attention to environmental social and governance matters may impact our business financial results or stock price companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental social and governance esg practices and disclosures including practices and disclosures related to climate change diversity and inclusion and governance standards investor advocacy groups certain institutional investors lenders investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on esg practices and disclosures and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments in addition government organizations are enhancing or advancing legal and regulatory requirements specific to esg matters the heightened stakeholder focus on esg issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws regulations standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements a failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in noncompliance the loss of business reputational impacts diluted market valuation an inability to attract customers and an

inability to attract and retain top talent in addition our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability 

legal quality and regulatory risks 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s the fda regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

our pharma services offerings are highly complex and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers our business could suffer our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and when necessary improve our quality management strategy and systems and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management a failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products in each case such problems could arise for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether 

in addition our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service any such failure could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenues reimbursement to customers for lost drug product registered intermediates registered starting materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients other customer claims damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high if problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of which could be significant 

we are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers additionally products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claims in addition patients involved in our clinical services trials conducted by our clinical development services business or taking drugs approved on the basis of those trials may also bring personal injury claims against us there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators 

any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 3487 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 500 billion as of january 7 2022 of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit the facility we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

our ability to make scheduled payments refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations if we are unable to service our debt refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain a financial ratio and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness merge or consolidate with other entities and create liens the covenants in the facility include a consolidated net interest coverage ratio consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest expense as such terms are defined in the facility specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility it will maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3510 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as the impact of foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and

the company mobilized in early 2020 to support the covid19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze diagnose and protect from the virus however as a result of the pandemic’s impact on various markets the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late march 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the analytical instruments segment and to a lesser extent some businesses within the company’s other three segments the negative impact significantly lessened in 2021 but could worsen in 2022 dependent on the success of global efforts to control and unwind from the pandemic and economic activity ramping up during 2021 the life sciences solutions and specialty diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support covid19 diagnostic testing scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the ongoing covid19 pandemic the biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements additionally through our pharma services business we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally while these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022 the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand sales of products related to covid19 response were 923 billion and 663 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

conditions were strong in each of the company’s end markets during 2021 revenues were particularly strong in pharma and biotech driven by strong market dynamics and the company’s role in supporting customers across a wide range of therapeutic areas including our role in supporting covid19 vaccines and therapies customers in the academic and

the increase in segment revenues at existing businesses in 2021 was driven by a combination of increased demand for testing to diagnose covid19 with higher sales of biosciences products and strong demand in each of the segment’s businesses the decrease in segment income margin resulted primarily from strategic growth investments offset in part by profit on higher sales

nonoperating items 



net interest expense interest expense less interest income increased due primarily to the increase in debt to finance the acquisition of ppd and for general corporate purposes offset in part by lower average interest rates see additional discussion under the caption “liquidity and capital resources” below 

gaap other incomeexpense and adjusted other incomeexpense includes currency transaction gains and losses on nonoperating monetary assets and liabilities and net periodic pension benefit costincome excluding the service cost component gaap other incomeexpense in 2021 also includes 767 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt note 10 and 36 million of financing costs associated with obtaining bridge financing commitments in connection with the agreement to acquire ppd note 2 offset in part by 66 million of net gains on investments gaap other incomeexpense in 2020 includes 81 million of financing costs for a terminated acquisition primarily for loan commitment fees and entering into hedging contracts and 42 million of expense reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items related to a hedge arrangement note 14 offset in part by 10 million of net gains on investments 

the company’s gaap and adjusted tax rates increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher profits at different marginal rates offset in part by the benefits of our tax planning initiatives the company’s 2021 gaap and adjusted tax rates were also impacted by income tax benefits on intraentity transactions totaling 284 million in 2020 the company’s gaap and adjusted tax rates were impacted by foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 96 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense a net income tax benefit of 51 million from a domestication transaction involving the transfer of nonus subsidiaries to the us and a 47 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements additionally the 2020 gaap tax rate included a 27 million tax benefit from tax audit settlements 

the effective tax rate in both 2021 and 2020 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 218 billion and 132 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the company expects its gaap effective tax rate in 2022 will be between 9 and 11 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events the company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 13 in 2022

results of operations continued 

the company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the us some of these countries have lower tax rates than the us the company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the us is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the us and on the statutory tax rates in those countries based on the dispersion of the company’s nonus income tax provision among many countries the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income aside from any resulting onetime adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets the company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends 



approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the us the company uses its nonus cash for needs outside of the us including acquisitions capacity expansion and repayment of thirdparty foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries in addition the company also transfers cash to the us using nontaxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related us dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends as a result of using such means of transferring cash to the us the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant nonus cash balances for the foreseeable future 

the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months 

as of december 31 2021 the company’s shortterm debt totaled 254 billion on january 7 2022 the company replaced its prior credit facility with a new revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to 500 billion of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit note 10 if the company borrows under this facility it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available as of december 31 2021 no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility although available capacity was reduced by approximately 4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit 



during 2021 cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of 204 million and 107 billion respectively primarily to support growth in sales an increase in accounts payable provided cash of 479 million changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of 724 million primarily due to the timing of tax and incentive compensation payments cash payments for income taxes were 218 billion during 2021 

during 2020 cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of 130 billion and 508 million respectively primarily to support growth in sales changes in other assets and other liabilities provided cash of 145 billion primarily due to the timing of incentive compensation payments and to a lesser extent customer billings cash payments for income taxes were 132 billion during 2020 

during 2021 acquisitions used cash of 1940 billion the companys investing activities also included the purchase of 252 billion of property plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments during 2020 the company’s investing activities were principally for the purchase of property plant and equipment

during 2021 issuance of senior notes provided 1814 billion of cash a net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of 251 billion repayment of debt used cash of 1174 billion including 430 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of ppd the company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of 200 billion of the companys common stock 41 million shares and the payment of 395 million in cash dividends on september 23 2021 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 billion of the company’s common stock early in the first quarter of 2022 the company repurchased 200 billion of the companys common stock 33 million shares at february 24 2022 authorization remained for 100 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock as discussed in note 10 in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3650 senior notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of 375 million 

during 2020 issuance of senior notes provided cash of 346 billion repayment of senior notes used cash of 710 million the company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of 150 billion of the company’s common stock 45 million shares and the payment of 337 million in cash dividends 

the company expects that for all of 2022 expenditures for property plant and equipment net of disposals will be between 25 and 27 billion 

in addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at december 31 2021 which include but are not limited to debt note 10 unrecognized tax benefits note 8 operating leases note 11 pension obligations note 7 and contingent consideration note 14 the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business that include agreements to purchase goods services or fixed assets and to pay royalties note 12 

the company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters an unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates if any for one or more of the matters described under the heading “ product liability workers compensation and other personal injury matters ” in note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows 

nongaap measures 

in addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as organic revenue growth which is reported revenue growth excluding the impacts of revenues from acquireddivested businesses and the effects of currency translation we report organic revenue growth because thermo fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s shortterm and longterm financial trends investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues thermo fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods 

we report adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted other incomeexpense adjusted tax rate and adjusted eps we believe that the use of these nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance especially when comparing such results to previous periods forecasts and to the performance of our competitors such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decisionmaking and for compensation purposes to calculate these measures we exclude as applicable 

• certain acquisitionrelated costs including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition significant transactionacquisitionrelated costs including changes in estimates of contingent acquisitionrelated consideration and other costs associated with obtaining shortterm financing commitments for pendingrecent acquisitions we exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs 

• costsincome associated with restructuring activities such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities we exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs 

• equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities impairments of longlived assets and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability including gainslosses on investments the sale of businesses product lines and real estate significant litigationrelated matters curtailmentssettlements of pension plans and the early retirement of debt we exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations andor in certain cases are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods 

• the expense associated with the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years exclusion of 

thermo fisher scientific inc

nongaap measures continued 

the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and longheld businesses and with both acquisitive and nonacquisitive peer companies 

• the tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate changes the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods 

we report free cash flow which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities the company uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain nondiscretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure 

the nongaap financial measures of thermo fisher scientific’s results of operations and cash flows included in this form 10k are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for thermo fisher scientific’s results of operations prepared in accordance with gaap reconciliations of such nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are set forth within the “overview” and “results of operations” sections and below

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to acquisitionrelated measurements and income taxes management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

acquisitionrelated measurements 

business combinations 

the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolesce rates the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition see note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 4192 billion and 124 billion respectively at december 31 2021 see note 1 for additional information estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates discount rates and other factors for the goodwill impairment tests the company considers i peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and ii estimated weighted average costs of capital different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets indications of fair value based on projections of cash flows which increased over the prior year projections at higher rates than the increases in carrying values and on peer revenues earnings trading multiples and discount rates which were relatively consistent with the prior year were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2021 the date of the company’s annual impairment testing there were no interim impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets in 2021 there can be no assurance however that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

definitelived intangible assets 

definitelived intangible assets totaled 1888 billion at december 31 2021 see note 1 for additional information the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset the company recorded impairments of 012 billion in 2021 see note 16 for additional information 

contingent consideration 

the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which were initially exchanged for control of businesses or assumed from acquired businesses was 032 billion at december 31 2021 at each reporting period the fair value of contingent consideration is determined using either discounted cash flow analyses monte carlo simulations or fair values of an underlying recapitalization investment portfolio changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes in estimates of revenue or operating results or in the timing or likelihood of achieving milestones as well as changes in the fair values of the investments underlying the recapitalization investment portfolio these changes resulted in benefitscharges of 005 billion during 2021 see note 14 for additional information 

income taxes 

unrecognized tax benefits 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes the company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled 112 billion at december 31 2021 see note 8 for additional information

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income 

valuation allowances 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit after consideration of all positive and negative evidence and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused in situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 097 billion at december 31 2021 see note 8 for additional information should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

undistributed earnings 

the company has not provided us state income taxes or additional nonus taxes on certain of its nonus subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies see note 8 for additional information these business plans and tax strategies consider shortterm and longterm forecasts and budgets of the us parent and nonus subsidiaries working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated the company’s past practices regarding nonus subsidiary dividends sources of financing by the us parent such as issuing debt or equity and uses of cash by the us parent that are more discretionary in nature such as business combinations and share repurchase programs however should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its us subsidiaries including cash maintained by these nonus subsidiaries the company would recognize additional tax liabilities it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional us state income tax and nonus tax liabilities that the company would incur the company’s intent is to only make distributions from nonus subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs 

recent accounting pronouncements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities the company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixedrate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps additionally the company uses shortterm forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates such exposures result from purchases sales cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations the currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro swiss franc british pounds sterling canadian dollars czech koruna japanese yen and hong kong dollars income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

interest rates 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2021 the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings the fair market value of the company’s 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued 

fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2021 was 3605 billion note 14 fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity if interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2021 would increase by approximately 251 billion if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2021 would decrease by approximately 252 billion 

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments including swap arrangements in 2021 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variablerate debt would have increased the company’s annual pretax interest expense by approximately 6 million 

currency exchange rates 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro british pounds sterling swedish kronor canadian dollars norwegian kroner and danish kroner the effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity the company also uses foreign currencydenominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2021 functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of approximately 123 billion 

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2021 nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 71 million a 10 appreciation in yearend 2021 nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currencyexchange contracts of 71 million the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2021 nonfunctional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of 27 million on the company’s net income

new products and research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position 

resources 

raw materials 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in many aspects of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens 

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

competition 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success primarily depends on the following factors

government regulation 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency usepa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites and are currently under the state’s licensed site remediation professional program as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site and in 2008 the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the usepa to complete a remedial investigationfeasibility study in 2018 the usepa issued a record of decision setting forth the scope of required remediation work at the site which includes upgrading a water treatment plant to address constituents such as chlorinated organic compounds 14dioxane and perfluorooctanoic acidperfluorooctane sulfonate pfoapfos in 2019 the company and another responsible party signed a proposed consent decree which the us government entered in 2020 requiring the parties to finance and perform the required remediation work with usepa oversight in 2011 our life technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the usepa and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former davis landfill superfund site in smithfield rhode island 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 71 million at december 31 2020 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

other laws and regulations 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

business continued 

regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in item 1 business under the caption “forwardlooking statements” 

industry and economic risks 

our growth would suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets would diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns 

we are subject to risks associated with public health crises and epidemicspandemics such as the covid19 pandemic our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemicspandemics such as covid19 the global spread of covid19 has created significant volatility uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption resulting in an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration 

covid19 has had an adverse impact on certain of our operations supply chains and distribution systems including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking due to these impacts and measures we have experienced significant and unpredictable reductions as well as increases in demand for certain of our products many employers in the united states and europe are continuing to require their employees to work from home or not go into their offices if the pandemic continues and conditions worsen we could experience a decline in sales activities and customer orders in certain of our businesses and it remains uncertain what impact these declines would have on future sales and customer orders once conditions begin to improve in addition to existing travel restrictions countries may continue to close or decline to reopen borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel which would significantly impact our ability to support our sites and customers in those locations and the ability of our employees to get to their places of work to produce products or significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain as a result covid19 may materially adversely affect revenue growth in certain of our businesses and it is uncertain how materially covid19 will affect our global operations generally if these impacts were to persist or worsen over an extended 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

period of time the extent and duration of the impacts are uncertain and dependent in part on customers returning to work and economic activity ramping up 

the company has mobilized to support the covid19 response with products and services that help diagnose the virus as well as assisting customers to develop potential therapeutics and vaccines used to protect from the virus our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees the ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 while we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees these measures may not be successful and we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures while we are staying in close communication with our sites employees customers and suppliers and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation the duration and extent of the effect of covid19 on the company is not determinable 

in addition several of the company’s businesses have had an increase in revenues due to sales of products addressing diagnosis and treatment of covid19 while these positive impacts are expected to continue into 2021 the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate our business is affected by general economic conditions both inside and outside the us if the global economy and financial markets or economic conditions in europe the us or other key markets continue to be unstable including as a result of the covid19 pandemic it could adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers distributors and suppliers having the effect of 

• reducing demand for some of our products 

• increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays 

• increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

• increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services 

• causing supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products and 

• creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2020 currency translation had a favorable effect of 133 million on revenues due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers 

• changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions 

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships including new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers 

• tariffs imposed by the us on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods including the tariffs recently adopted by the us government on various imports from china and by the chinese government on certain us goods 

• the impact of public health epidemicspandemics on the global economy such as the covid19 pandemic 

• negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and

for example on january 31 2020 the united kingdom formally withdrew from the european union or eu commonly referred to as “brexit” and on december 24 2020 the uk and eu announced they had entered into a postbrexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues this withdrawal has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the united kingdom these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses 

demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 

spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget an impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards competitive factors include technological innovation price service and delivery breadth of product line customer support ebusiness capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenues and operating results would suffer 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenues 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

• strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets 

• allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects 

• developing new applications for our technologies 

• expanding our service offerings 

• continuing key customer initiatives 

• combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively

• finding new markets for our products and 

• continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support crossselling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings 

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business 

because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 2604 billion and 124 billion respectively as of december 31 2020 in addition we have definitelived intangible assets totaling 1145 billion as of december 31 2020 we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired we assess the realizability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also rely on our information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as interacting with suppliers selling our products and services fulfilling orders and billing collecting and making payments shipping products

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flows our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins and steel while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

natural disasters public health crises political crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend and could impact customer spending we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk an earthquake or other natural disaster such as a fire or hurricane or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control such as strikes or other labor unrest could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if any of our facilities including our manufacturing or warehouse facilities or the facilities of our suppliers thirdparty service providers or customers is affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis power shortages or outages floods or monsoons public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics political crises such as terrorism war political instability or other conflict or other events outside of our control such as strikes or other labor unrest our results of operations could be adversely affected moreover these types of events could negatively impact customer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity globally which could also adversely impact our operating results for example as described above the covid19 pandemic has impacted and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenues associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

our pharma services offerings are highly complex and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers our business could suffer our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and when necessary improve our quality management strategy and systems and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management a failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products in each case such problems could arise for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether 

in addition our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service any such failure could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenues reimbursement to customers for lost drug product registered intermediates registered starting materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients other customer claims damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high if problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of which could be significant 

we are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers additionally products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators

our existing and future indebtedness may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities and negatively impact our credit ratings as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 2174 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 300 billion of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

our ability to make scheduled payments refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations if we are unable to service our debt refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness merge or consolidate with other entities make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in the facility include a consolidated net interest coverage ratio consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest expense as such terms are defined in the facility specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility it will maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3510 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter

overview 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses the company’s operations fall into four segments note 4 life sciences solutions analytical instruments specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services 

the company mobilized in early 2020 to support the covid19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze diagnose and protect from the virus however the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late march 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the analytical instruments segment and to a lesser extent some businesses within the company’s other three segments the extent and duration of the negative impacts continuing into 2021 are uncertain and dependent in part on the success of global efforts to control the pandemic and economic activity ramping up the company believes the impacted businesses’ longterm prospects remain excellent given the company’s attractive markets served its industryleading position and proven growth strategy several of the company’s businesses have had a significant increase in revenues due to sales of product and services addressing diagnosis and treatment of covid19 including test kits and to a lesser extent products and services for therapy and vaccine development and manufacturing while these positive impacts are expected to continue into 2021 the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand 

recent acquisitions and divestiture 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions the company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below 

on april 30 2019 the company acquired within the laboratory products and services segment brammer bio for approximately 167 billion in cash brammer bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies the acquisition expanded the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities brammer bio reported revenues of approximately 140 million in 2018 

on june 28 2019 the company sold its anatomical pathology business to phc holdings corporation for 113 billion net of cash divested the business was part of the specialty diagnostics segment revenues in 2019 through the date of sale and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately 115 million and 238 million respectively net of retained sales through the companys healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses

sales in 2020 were 3222 billion an increase of 668 billion from 2019 sales increased 78 million due to acquisitions net of a divestiture the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of 133 million in 2020

overview of results of operations and liquidity continued 

aside from the effects of acquisitionsdivestitures and currency translation revenues increased 647 billion 25 primarily due to increased demand sales of products that address covid19 testing and treatment totaled 663 billion in 2020 and were offset in part by lower revenues in the remainder of the business during the first half of 2020 sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing the covid19 virus offset in part by lower sales of other products due to pandemicrelated impacts on customer activity sales were also strong to customers in pharma and biotech markets where demand was strong for products and services and pandemicrelated demand for therapies and vaccines also contributed to growth sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from weakened economic conditions related to covid19 sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 sales to academic and government customers decreased due primarily to closure of academic labs during the global pandemic sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2020 sales growth was particularly strong in north america and europe and to a lesser extent in the asiapacific region 

in 2020 total company operating income and operating income margin were 779 billion and 242 respectively compared with 459 billion and 180 respectively in 2019 the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and to a lesser extent sales mix offset in part by a gain on the sale of the anatomical pathology business included in the 2019 period and strategic growth investments in 2020 the company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities including expansion of geographic sales reach and ecommerce platforms marketing initiatives expanded service and operational infrastructure focused research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees the company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi business system reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities and low cost region manufacturing productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases 

the company recorded a provision for income taxes of 850 million in 2020 effective tax rate of 118 in 2020 the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 96 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense and also recorded a net income tax benefit of 51 million from a domestication transaction involving the transfer of nonus subsidiaries to the us a 47 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements and a 27 million tax benefit from tax audit settlements 

the company recorded a provision for income taxes of 374 million in 2019 effective tax rate of 92 including 191 million related to the gain on the sale of the anatomical pathology business in 2019 the company recorded a 62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 75 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense and recorded a 79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intraentity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable 

the effective tax rate in both 2020 and 2019 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 132 billion and 090 billion in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the company expects its effective tax rate in 2021 will be between 11 and 13 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events 

net income increased to 638 billion in 2020 from 370 billion in 2019 principally due to the increase in operating income in 2020 discussed above offset in part by the increase in the income tax provision 

during 2020 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 829 billion compared with 497 billion for 2019 the increase primarily resulted from higher cash provided by income and to a lesser extent lower investment in working capital in 2020 

as of december 31 2020 the company’s shortterm debt totaled 263 billion substantially all of which was redeemed in january 2021 the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to 300 billion of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit note 10 if the company borrows under this facility it intends to leave undrawn an amount

equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available as of december 31 2020 no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility although available capacity was reduced by approximately 31 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit 

the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of 1033 billion as of december 31 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to intangible assets and goodwill income taxes and contingencies and litigation management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

a intangible assets and goodwill 

the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition definitelived intangible assets totaled 1145 billion at december 31 2020 the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 2604 billion and 124 billion respectively at december 31 2020 estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates discount rates and other factors for the goodwill impairment tests the company considers i peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and ii estimated weighted average costs of capital different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets indications of fair value based on projections of profitability and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2020 the date of the company’s annual impairment testing there can be no assurance however that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

b income taxes 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes the company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled 109 billion at december 31 2020 

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit after consideration of all positive and negative evidence and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused in situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 933 million at december 31 2020 should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

the company has not provided us state income taxes or additional nonus taxes on certain of its nonus subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies these business plans and tax strategies consider shortterm and longterm forecasts and budgets of the us parent and nonus subsidiaries working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated the company’s past practices regarding nonus subsidiary dividends sources of financing by the us parent such as issuing debt or equity and uses of cash by the us parent that are more discretionary in nature such as business combinations and share repurchase programs however should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its us subsidiaries including cash maintained by these nonus subsidiaries the company would recognize additional tax liabilities it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional us state income tax and nonus tax liabilities that the company would incur the company’s intent is to only make distributions from nonus subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs 

c contingencies and litigation 

the company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental workers’ compensation product general and auto liabilities and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on management’s judgment historical claims experience the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarial estimates accruals of acquired businesses including product liability and environmental accruals are initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value additionally the company records receivables from thirdparty insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable

in 2020 total company operating income and operating income margin were 779 billion and 242 respectively compared with 459 billion and 180 respectively in 2019 the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and to a lesser extent sales mix offset in part by a gain on the sale of the anatomical pathology business included in the 2019 period and strategic growth investments in 2020

operating income margin was 158 in 2020 compared to 231 in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to sales mix the decrease in sales a 108 million charge related to a longterm supply contract discussed in note 12 and to a lesser extent strategic growth investments offset in part by productivity improvements 

specialty diagnostics 



sales in the specialty diagnostics segment increased 163 billion to 534 billion in 2020 sales increased 173 billion 48 due to higher revenues at existing businesses the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of 14 million and the divestiture of the anatomical pathology business in june 2019 decreased revenues by 121 million the increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to higher demand primarily driven by products addressing treatment of covid19 with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segments healthcare market channel business and to a lesser extent microbiology and clinical diagnostics products these increases were offset in part by lower sales in some of the segment’s businesses due to pandemicrelated reductions in demand 

operating income margin was 256 in 2020 and 250 in 2019 the increase was primarily due to profit on higher sales offset in part by sales mix and to a lesser extent strategic growth investments 

laboratory products and services 



sales in the laboratory products and services segment increased 165 billion to 1225 billion in 2020 sales increased 141 billion 13 due to higher revenues at existing businesses and 184 million due to acquisitions the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of 52 million the increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold through its research and safety market channel business and to a lesser extent service offerings of the segments pharma services business the increase in demand was driven by pandemic response as well as the segment’s other products and services 

operating income margin was 104 in 2020 and 125 in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to sales mix and strategic growth investments offset in part by profit on higher sales and to a lesser extent productivity improvements 

other expense net 

in 2020 the company recorded 81 million of financing costs for a terminated acquisition primarily for amortization of loan commitment fees and entering into currency hedging contracts in 2019 the company recorded 184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt offset in part by 44 million of net gains on investments the investment gains include a 28 million gain on the sale of a joint venture for net proceeds of 42 million in the first quarter of 2021 the company recorded approximately 197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt note 10 

provision for income taxes 

the company recorded a provision for income taxes of 850 million in 2020 effective tax rate of 118 in 2020 the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 96 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense and also recorded a net income tax benefit of 51 million from a domestication

transaction involving the transfer of nonus subsidiaries to the us a 47 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements and a 27 million tax benefit from tax audit settlements 

the company recorded a provision for income taxes of 374 million in 2019 effective tax rate of 92 including 191 million related to the gain on the sale of the anatomical pathology business in 2019 the company recorded a 62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 75 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense and recorded a 79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intraentity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable 

the effective tax rate in both 2020 and 2019 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 132 billion and 090 billion in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the company expects its effective tax rate in 2021 will be between 11 and 13 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events 

the company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the us some of these countries have lower tax rates than the us the company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the us is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the us and on the statutory tax rates in those countries based on the dispersion of the company’s nonus income tax provision among many countries the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income aside from any resulting onetime adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate

the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of 1033 billion as of december 31 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities the company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixedrate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps additionally the company uses shortterm forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates such exposures result from purchases sales cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations the currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in swiss franc euro british pounds sterling canadian dollars hong kong dollars japanese yen and czech koruna income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

interest rates 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2020 the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings the fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2020 was 2467 billion note 14 fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity if interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2020 would increase by approximately 152 billion if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2020 would decrease by approximately 192 billion 

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments including swap arrangements in 2020 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variablerate debt would have increased the company’s annual pretax interest expense by approximately 14 million 

currency exchange rates 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro british pounds sterling swedish kronor canadian dollars swiss franc norwegian kroner and danish kroner the effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity the company also uses foreign currencydenominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2020 functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of approximately 122 billion 

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2020 nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 410 million a 10 appreciation in yearend 2020 nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currencyexchange contracts of 348 million the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2020 nonfunctional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of 18 million on the company’s net income

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position 

raw materials 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in many aspects of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens 

working capital requirements 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

dependency on a single customer 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years 

backlog 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2019 and 2018 was as follows 



we believe that approximately 63 of our backlog at the end of 2019 will be filled during 2020 

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results

environmental matters 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency usepa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites and are currently under the state’s licensed site remediation professional program as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site and in 2008 the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the usepa to complete a remedial investigationfeasibility study in 2018 the usepa issued a record of decision including the scope of required remediation work based on findings of this study in 2019 the company and another responsible party signed a proposed consent decree that once approved by the court requires the parties to finance and perform the required remediation work with usepa oversight in 2011 our life technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the usepa and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former davis landfill superfund site in smithfield rhode island 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 66 million at december 31 2019 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of

operations or cash flows however we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulatory affairs 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

• creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns 

demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 

spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget an impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2019 currency translation had an unfavorable effect of 440 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers 

• changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions 

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships including new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers

• tariffs imposed by the us on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods including the tariffs recently adopted by the us government on various imports from china and by the chinese government on certain us goods 

• the impact of public health epidemics on the global economy such as the coronavirus currently impacting china 

• negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and 

• geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil including terrorism and war 

for example on january 31 2020 the united kingdom formally withdrew from the european union or eu and entered a transition period during which it will negotiate a trade deal with the eu this withdrawal has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the united kingdom these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example we manufacture pharmaceuticals and many of our instruments are marketed to the

pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

our pharma services offerings are highly complex and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers our business could suffer our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and when necessary improve our quality management strategy and systems and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management a failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products in each case such problems could arise for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether 

in addition our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service any such failure could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue reimbursement to customers for lost drug product registered intermediates registered starting materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients other customer claims damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high if problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of which could be significant 

we are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers additionally products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators 

any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 2571 billion and 125 billion respectively as of december 31 2019 in addition we have definitelived intangible assets totaling 1276 billion as of december 31 2019 we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired we assess the realizability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses

if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected

these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also rely on our information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as interacting with suppliers selling our products and services fulfilling orders and billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers tracking customer activity fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer hackers computer viruses ransomware phishing computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results any of the cyberattacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above if significant could materially interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results

overview 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses the company’s operations fall into four segments see note 4 life sciences solutions analytical instruments specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services 

recent acquisitions and divestiture 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions the company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestiture are described below 

on october 25 2018 the company acquired within the life sciences solutions segment becton dickinson and companys advanced bioprocessing business for 477 million in cash this north americabased business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment’s bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs the advanced bioprocessing business reported revenues of 100 million in 2017 

on april 30 2019 the company acquired within the laboratory products and services segment brammer bio for approximately 167 billion in cash brammer bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies the acquisition expands the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities brammer bio reported revenues of approximately 140 million in 2018 

on june 28 2019 the company sold its anatomical pathology business to phc holdings corporation for 113 billion net of cash divested the business was part of the specialty diagnostics segment the sale of this business resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 478 million included in restructuring and other income costs net revenues in 2019 through the date of sale and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately 115 million and 238 million respectively net of retained sales through the companys healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 



sales in 2019 were 2554 billion an increase of 118 billion from 2018 sales increased 153 million due to acquisitions net of a divestiture the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of 440 million in 2019 aside from the effects of acquisitionsdivestitures and currency translation revenues increased 147 billion 6 primarily due to increased demand sales to customers in each of the company’s primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas in 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2019 sales to industrial customers declined and sales growth in asia was modest due to weaker end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter in 2018

overview of results of operations and liquidity continued 

in 2019 total company operating income and operating income margin were 459 billion and 180 respectively compared with 378 billion and 155 respectively in 2018 the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales the gain on the sale of the anatomical pathology business and to a lesser extent productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases these increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange the company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities including expansion of geographic sales reach and ecommerce platforms marketing initiatives expanded service and operational infrastructure focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience the company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi business system reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities and low cost region manufacturing 

the company recorded a 374 million provision for income taxes in 2019 including 191 million related to the gain on the sale of the anatomical pathology business in 2019 the company recorded a 62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 75 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense and recorded a 79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intraentity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable 

the company recorded a 324 million provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of 68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act recorded in 2017 consisting of an incremental provision of 117 million offset in part by a 49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017 these adjustments were required based on new us treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections legislative updates regulations earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes in 2018 the provision for income taxes also included a 71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the anatomical pathology business 

the effective tax rate in both 2019 and 2018 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 896 million and 591 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the company expects its effective tax rate in 2020 will be between 8 and 10 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events 

income from continuing operations increased to 370 billion in 2019 from 294 billion in 2018 principally due to increase in operating income in 2019 discussed above offset in part by 184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2019 note 10 

during 2019 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 497 billion compared with 454 billion for 2018 the increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation and lower investment in working capital in the 2019 period 

as of december 31 2019 the company’s shortterm debt totaled 676 million including 672 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to 250 billion of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit if the company borrows under this facility it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available as of december 31 2019 no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility although available capacity was reduced by approximately 72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit 

the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of 240 billion as of december 31 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months

and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to intangible assets and goodwill income taxes and contingencies and litigation management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition definitelived intangible assets totaled 1276 billion at december 31 2019 the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 2571 billion and 125 billion respectively at december 31 2019 estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates discount rates and other factors for the goodwill impairment tests the company considers i peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and ii estimated weighted average costs of capital different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

for reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test indications of fair value based on projections of profitability and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2019 the date of the company’s annual impairment testing there can be no assurance however that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

b income taxes 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax

positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes the company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled 155 billion at december 31 2019 

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit after consideration of all positive and negative evidence and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused in situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 408 million at december 31 2019 should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

the company has not provided us state income taxes or additional nonus taxes on certain of its nonus subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies these business plans and tax strategies consider shortterm and longterm forecasts and budgets of the us parent and nonus subsidiaries working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated the company’s past practices regarding nonus subsidiary dividends sources of financing by the us parent such as issuing debt or equity and uses of cash by the us parent that are more discretionary in nature such as business combinations and share repurchase programs however should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its us subsidiaries including cash maintained by these nonus subsidiaries the company would recognize additional tax liabilities it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional us state income tax and nonus tax liabilities that the company would incur the company’s intent is to only make distributions from nonus subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs 

c contingencies and litigation 

the company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental workers’ compensation product general and auto liabilities and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on management’s judgment historical claims experience the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarial estimates accruals of acquired businesses including product liability and environmental accruals are initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value additionally the company records receivables from thirdparty insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable

sales in 2019 were 2554 billion an increase of 118 billion from 2018 sales increased 153 million due to acquisitions the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of 440 million in 2019 aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation revenues increased 147 billion 6 primarily due to increased demand sales to customers in each of the company’s primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas in 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2019 sales to industrial customers declined and sales growth in asia was modest due to weaker end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter in 2018 

in 2019 total company operating income and operating income margin were 459 billion and 180 respectively compared with 378 billion and 155 respectively in 2018 the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales the gain on the sale of the anatomical pathology business and to a lesser extent productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases these increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange 

in 2019 the company recorded restructuring and other income net of 334 million including 482 million of net gains on the sale of businesses principally the anatomical pathology business see note 2 the company also recorded 17 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and 62 million of net charges to selling general and administrative expenses principally transaction and integrationrelated costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture in addition the company recorded 52 million of cash restructuring charges net primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the us and europe see note 16 

in 2018 the company recorded restructuring and other costs net of 91 million including 12 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition the company recorded 29 million of net charges to selling general and administrative expenses primarily for thirdparty transaction and integration costs associated with recent and pending acquisitions offset in part by income from favorable results of product liability litigation in addition the company recorded 88 million of cash restructuring costs in its continued effort to streamline operations including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the us and europe the company also recorded 38 million of other income net principally for resolution of a litigation matter 

as of february 26 2020 the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately 65 million primarily in 2020 and expects to identify additional actions during 2020 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred approximately 25 of the additional charges will be incurred in the life sciences solutions segment 30 in the analytical instruments segment 35 in the laboratory products and services segment and 10 in the specialty diagnostics segment the restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2019 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately 60 million beginning in part in 2019 and to a greater extent in 2020 including 20 million in the life sciences solutions segment 15 million in the analytical instruments segment 5 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and 20

million in the laboratory products and services segment the restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2018 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 65 million beginning in part in 2018 and to a greater extent in 2019 including 20 million in the life sciences solutions segment 10 million in the analytical instruments segment 5 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and 30 million in the laboratory products and services segment

income from the company’s reportable segments increased 6 to 597 billion in 2019 due primarily to profit on higher sales and to a lesser extent productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases offset in part by strategic growth investments sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange 

life sciences solutions

results of operations continued 

sales in the life sciences solutions segment increased 587 million to 686 billion in 2019 sales increased 620 million 10 due to higher revenues at existing businesses and 89 million due to an acquisition the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of 122 million the increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segments principal businesses with particular strength in sales of bioproduction and biosciences products 

operating income margin was 357 in 2019 compared to 344 in 2018 the increase in operating margin resulted primarily from profit on higher sales offset in part by strategic growth investments and to a lesser extent sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange 

analytical instruments 



sales in the analytical instruments segment increased 53 million to 552 billion in 2019 sales increased 149 million 3 due to higher revenues at existing businesses the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of 96 million the increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to increased demand for products sold by each of the segments primary businesses with particular strength in chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments sales decreased in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to industrial end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter of 2018 

operating income margin was 231 in 2019 compared to 228 in 2018 the increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases these increases were offset in part by sales mix and strategic growth investments 

specialty diagnostics 



sales in the specialty diagnostics segment remained flat at 372 billion in 2019 sales increased 186 million 5 due to higher revenues at existing businesses the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of 66 million and the divestiture of the anatomical pathology business decreased revenues by 126 million the increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to increased demand for products sold through the segments healthcare market channel as well as clinical diagnostic and immunodiagnostic products 

operating income margin was 250 in 2019 and 256 in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to strategic growth investments and to a lesser extent sales mix and the divestiture of the anatomical pathology business these decreases were offset in part by profit on higher sales and to a lesser extent productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases following multiyear extensions of several expiring licensing arrangements with commercial partners segment revenues and operating income in 2020 will both be unfavorably affected by approximately 30 million 

laboratory products and services 



sales in the laboratory products and services segment increased 564 million to 1060 billion in 2019 sales increased 604 million 6 due to higher revenues at existing businesses and 187 million due to acquisitions the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of 167 million a change in the method of reporting certain intersegment sales reduced segment revenues by 60 million with no impact to consolidated results the increase in revenue at

existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segments principal businesses with particular strength in service offerings of its pharma services business and products sold through its research and safety market channel business 

operating income margin was 125 in both 2019 and 2018 increases from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases were offset by strategic growth investments and to a lesser extent sales mix 

other expenseincome net 

in 2019 the company recorded 184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt offset in part by 44 million of net gains on investments the investment gains include a 28 million gain on the sale of a joint venture for net proceeds of 42 million in 2018 the company recorded 15 million of net losses on investments 

provision for income taxes 

the company recorded a 374 million provision for income taxes in 2019 including 191 million related to the gain on the sale of the anatomical pathology business in 2019 the company recorded a 62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 75 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense and recorded a 79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intraentity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable 

the company recorded a 324 million provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of 68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 recorded in 2017 consisting of an incremental provision of 117 million offset in part by a 49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017 these adjustments were required based on new us treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections legislative updates regulations earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes in 2018 the provision for income taxes also included a 71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the anatomical pathology business 

the effective tax rate in both 2019 and 2018 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 896 million and 591 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the company expects its effective tax rate in 2020 will be between 8 and 10 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events 

the company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the us some of these countries have lower tax rates than the us the company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the us is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the us and on the statutory tax rates in those countries based on the dispersion of the company’s nonus income tax provision among many countries the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income aside from any resulting onetime adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities the company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixedrate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps additionally the company uses shortterm forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates such exposures result from purchases sales cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations the currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in swiss franc euro canadian dollars swedish kronor british pounds sterling japanese yen and czech koruna income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

interest rates 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2019 the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings the fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2019 was 1867 billion see note 14 fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity if interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2019 would increase by approximately 149 billion if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2019 would decrease by approximately 150 billion 

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments including swap arrangements in 2019 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variablerate debt would have increased the company’s annual pretax interest expense by approximately 16 million 

currency exchange rates 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in british pounds sterling swedish kronor euro canadian dollars swiss franc norwegian kroner and danish kroner the effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity the company also uses foreign currencydenominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2019 functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 114 billion 

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2019 nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 243 million a 10 appreciation in yearend 2019 nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currencyexchange contracts of 203 million the 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued 

unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2019 nonfunctional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of 32 million on the company’s net income

 sales and marketing 

we market and sell our products and services through a direct sales force customerservice professionals electronic commerce thirdparty distributors and various catalogs 

we have approximately 12000  sales personnel including highly trained technical specialists who enable us to better meet the needs of our more technical endusers we also provide customers with product standardization and other supplychainmanagement services to reduce procurement costs 

new products and research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position 

raw materials 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in many aspects of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens 

working capital requirements 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

dependency on a single customer 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years

backlog 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2018  and 2017  was as follows 



we believe that approximately 90  of our backlog at the end of 2018  will be filled during 2019  

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

competition 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success primarily depends on the following factors 

 environmental matters 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

business continued 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites and are currently under the state’s licensed site remediation professional program as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site and in 2008 the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the us environmental protection agency usepa to complete a remedial investigationfeasibility study in 2018 the usepa issued a record of decision including the scope of required remediation work based on findings of this study the company has indicated its willingness to finance and perform the required remediation work together with the other responsible parties in 2011 our life technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the usepa and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former davis landfill superfund site in smithfield rhode island 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 69 million  at december 31 2018  

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulatory affairs 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

risk factors 

tableend set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in item 1 business  under the caption forwardlooking statements 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards competitive factors include technological innovation price service and delivery breadth of product line customer support ebusiness capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 



thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

 we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate our business is affected by general economic conditions both inside and outside the us if the global economy and financial markets or economic conditions in europe the us or other key markets are unstable it could adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers distributors and suppliers having the effect of 

 demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 

spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget an impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending 

economic political foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2018  currency translation had a favorable  effect of 173 million  on revenues due to the weakening  of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 



thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

 significant developments stemming from the us administration or the uk’s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us the us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements and is imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the united states the administration has also indicated an intention to request congress to make significant changes replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act and government negotiationregulation of drug prices paid by government programs changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business 

additionally on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union or eu this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom’s referendum in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the united kingdom these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the united kingdom’s actual or threatened withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

risk factors continued 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

our pharma services offerings are highly complex and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers our business could suffer our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and when necessary improve our quality management strategy and systems and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management a failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products in each case such problems could arise for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether 

in addition our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service any such failure could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue reimbursement to customers for lost drug product registered intermediates registered starting materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients other customer claims damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high if problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of which could be significant 

we are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers additionally products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators 

any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 2535 billion  and 127 billion  respectively as of december 31 2018  in addition we have definitelived intangible assets totaling 1371 billion  as of december 31 2018  we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired we assess the

realizability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations and are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies  we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the us federal drug administration the fda the us drug enforcement agency the dea various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services the dhhs the european medicines agency the ema in europe the eu member states and other comparable agencies and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us in particular we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the dea the fda the dhhs foreign agencies including the ema and other various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of many of our products and services including medical devices and pharma services are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea the ema and other equivalent local state federal and nonus regulatory authorities in addition we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities including without limitation remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals including those relating to products or facilities in addition such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs any or all of which could be significant we are the sole manufacturer of a number of 

thermo fisher scientific inc

pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers ability to provide products to their customers 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption anticompetition and privacy and data protection laws any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites  we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins and steel while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also rely on our information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as interacting with suppliers selling our products and services fulfilling orders and billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers tracking customer activity fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise conducting business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer hackers computer viruses ransomware phishing computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results any of the cyberattacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above if significant could materially interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

consequences as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe and the recentlyenacted eu general data protection regulation which took effect in may 2018 imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data several countries such as china and russia have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 1899 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 250 billion  of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

our ability to make scheduled payments refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations if we are unable to service our debt refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness merge or consolidate with other entities make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility the facility include a consolidated leverage ratio total debttoconsolidated ebitda and a consolidated interest coverage ratio consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as such terms are defined in the facility specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility it will maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 35 10 the company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility it will maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 30 10 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

sales in 2018  were 2436 billion  an increase  of 344 billion  from 2017  sales increased   153 billion  due to acquisitions the favorable  effects of currency translation resulted in an increase  in revenues of 173 million  in 2018  aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation revenues increased   174 billion   8  primarily due to increased demand sales to customers in each of the companys primary end markets grew sales growth was strong in each of the companys primary geographic areas particularly asia   

in 2018  total company operating income and operating income margin were 378 billion  and 155  respectively compared with 296 billion  and 142  respectively in 2017  the increase  in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and to a lesser extent the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases offset in part by an increase in strategic growth investments unfavorable sales mix and amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets due to recent acquisitions   the company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities including expansion of geographic sales reach and ecommerce platforms marketing initiatives expanded service and operational infrastructure focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience the company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi business system reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities and low cost region manufacturing   

the company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of 68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017  the tax act  recorded in 2017 consisting of an incremental provision of 117 million offset in part by a 49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017 these adjustments were required based on new us treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections legislative updates regulations earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes in 2018 the provision for income taxes also included a 71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the planned sale of the anatomical pathology business note 2 

the company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2017 principally due to a net provision of 204 million from the effects of the tax act consisting primarily of a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the us statutory tax rate reduction in 2017 the company refinanced certain long term intercompany debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of 237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes in addition in 2017 the company recorded a 65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in singapore the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to nonus subsidiaries in 2017 these nonus subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s us operations which resulted in no net tax cost as a result of these distributions the company benefitted from us foreign tax credits of 86 million offset in part by additional us income taxes of 53 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017 for a net benefit of 33 million the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the us during the reporting year and the us treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 20 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense  

the effective tax rate in both 2018 and 2017 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition

overview of results of operations and liquidity continued 

income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 591 million and 479 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively   

the company expects its effective tax rate in 2019 will be between 7 and 10 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events   

income from continuing operations increased  to 294 billion  in 2018  from 223 billion  in 2017  principally due to increase  in operating income in 2018  discussed above 

during 2018  the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 454 billion  compared with 401 billion  for 2017  the increase  primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2018 period offset in part by higher investment in working capital to support sales growth 

as of december 31 2018  the company’s shortterm debt totaled 127 billion  including 693 million  of commercial paper obligations and 573 million  of senior notes due within the next twelve months the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to 250 billion  of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit if the company borrows under this facility it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available as of december 31 2018  no  borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility although available capacity was reduced by approximately 82 million  as a result of outstanding letters of credit   

the company expects to fund the acquisition of gatan inc with a combination of existing cash balances and shortterm borrowings the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of 210 billion  as of december 31 2018  and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months   

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to intangible assets and goodwill income taxes contingencies and litigation and pension costs management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

 the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition definitelived intangible assets totaled 1371 billion  at december 31 2018  the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition 

and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 2535 billion  and 127 billion  respectively at december 31 2018  estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth discount rates and other factors for the goodwill impairment tests the company considers peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and estimated weighted average costs of capital different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

for reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2019  and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2018  the date of the company’s impairment testing there can be no assurance however that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

with the completion of the patheon acquisition in august 2017 the company established a new reporting unit called pharma services which solely consists of the legacy patheon business the book carrying value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date during its annual 2018 goodwill impairment assessment the company determined that the pharma services reporting units cushion of fair value over book value had increased to 5 despite this favorable increase given that the fair value of the reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value relatively small decreases in future cash flows from anticipated results could result in impairment of goodwill the key variables that drive the valuation of the reporting unit are revenue and operating income growth rate assumptions peer revenue and earnings trading multiples as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate applied the estimates used for these assumptions represent managements best estimates which the company believes are reasonable these assumptions however are subject to variability and uncertainty including the degree to which the reporting unit will grow revenue and profitability levels the pharma services reporting unit had 337 billion of goodwill and an overall carrying value of 770 billion as of december 31 2018 

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes the company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled 144 billion  at december 31 2018  

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit after consideration of all positive and negative evidence and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused in situations in which the company has been able to conclude that its deferred tax assets will be realized it has generally relied on future reversals of taxable temporary differences expected future taxable income where such estimates have historically been reliable and other factors if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 471 million  at december 31 2018  should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

the company has not provided state income or foreign withholding taxes on certain of its nonus subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies these business plans and tax strategies consider shortterm and longterm forecasts and budgets of the us parent and nonus subsidiaries working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated the company’s past practices regarding nonus subsidiary dividends sources of financing by the us parent such as issuing debt or equity and uses of cash by the us parent that are more discretionary in nature such as business combinations and share repurchase programs however should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its us subsidiaries including cash maintained by these nonus subsidiaries the company would recognize additional tax liabilities it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional state and foreign withholding tax liabilities that the company would incur the company’s intent is to only make distributions from nonus subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs 

 the company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental workers’ compensation product general and auto liabilities and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on management’s judgment historical claims experience the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates accruals of acquired businesses including product liability and environmental accruals were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value additionally the company records receivables from thirdparty insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

 several of the company’s us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with thirdparty actuaries and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled 22 million  in 2018  the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled 391 million  at yearend 2018  compared with 486 million  at yearend 2017  should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation for example a 10 decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately 2 million  and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately 93 million

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

the table below summarizes by period due or expiration of commitment the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december 31 2018  



 the contractual obligation at december 31 2018 to acquire gatan inc for approximately 925 million has been omitted from the above table the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals 

reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of 144 billion  have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions 

the company has no material commitments for purchases of property plant and equipment other than those included in the above table but expects that for 2019  such expenditures will be between 800 and 850 million  

guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment see note 11  the residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of 147 million  the initial terms of these leases end in 2019 2020 and 2023 although renewal options exist for each 

a guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment the purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so the amount of the guarantee at december 31 2018  was 38 million  

in disposing of assets or businesses the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including for example unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees the company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions however the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position annual results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities the company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixedrate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps additionally the company uses shortterm forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates such exposures result from purchases sales cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations the currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro british pounds sterling swiss franc norwegian kroner canadian dollars japanese yen and swedish kronor income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

interest rates 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2018  the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings the fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2018  was 1904 billion  see note 13  fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity if interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2018  would increase by approximately 106 billion  if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2018  would decrease by approximately 098 billion  

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments including swap arrangements in 2018  a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variablerate debt would have increased the company’s annual pretax interest expense by approximately 43 million  

currency exchange rates 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in british pounds sterling swedish kronor euro canadian dollars swiss franc norwegian kroner and danish kroner the effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders’ equity the company also uses foreign currencydenominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2018  functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 084 billion  

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2018  nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 145 million  a 10 appreciation in yearend 2018  nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currencyexchange contracts of 138 million  the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2018  nonfunctional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of 25 million  on the company’s net income

raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in many aspects of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens 

working capital requirements 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

dependency on a single customer 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years

backlog 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2017  and 2016  was as follows 



we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2017  will be filled during 2018  

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

competition 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success primarily depends on the following factors 

 environmental matters 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

business continued 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites and are currently under the state’s licensed site remediation professional program as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site and in 2008 the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the us environmental protection agency usepa to complete a remedial investigationfeasibility study in 2011 our life technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the usepa and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former davis landfill superfund site in smithfield rhode island 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 52 million  at december 31 2017  

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulatory affairs 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

number of employees 

we have approximately 70000  employees

risk factors 

tableend set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in item 1 business  under the caption forwardlooking statements 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards competitive factors include technological innovation price service and delivery breadth of product line customer support ebusiness capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

 we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate our business is affected by general economic conditions both inside and outside the us if the global economy and financial markets or economic conditions in europe the us or other key markets are unstable it could adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers distributors and suppliers having the effect of 

 demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 

spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget an impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2017  currency translation had a favorable  effect of 70 million  on revenues due to the weakening  of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

significant developments stemming from the us administration or the uk’s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us the us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the united states particularly from china and mexico the administration has also indicated an intention to request congress to make significant changes replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act and government negotiationregulation of drug prices paid by government programs changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business 

additionally on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union or eu this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom’s referendum in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the united kingdom these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the united kingdom’s actual or threatened withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights our life technologies subsidiary is party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim we infringe their intellectual property note 10  we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

our pharma services offerings are highly complex and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers our business could suffer our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and when necessary improve our quality management strategy and systems and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management a failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products in each case such problems could arise for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether 

in addition our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service any such failure could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue reimbursement to customers for lost drug product registered intermediates registered starting materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients other customer claims damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high if problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of which could be significant 

we are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers additionally products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators 

any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 2529 billion  and 127 billion  respectively as of december 31 2017  in addition we have definitelived intangible assets totaling 1541 billion  as of december 31 2017  we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired we assess the realizability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations and are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies  we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the us federal drug administration the fda the us drug enforcement agency the dea various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the us department of health and human services the dhhs the european medicines agency the ema in europe the eu member states and other comparable agencies and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us in particular we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the dea the fda the dhhs foreign agencies including the ema and other various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of many of our products and services including medical devices and pharma services are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea the ema and other equivalent local state federal and nonus regulatory authorities in addition we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities including without limitation remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals including those relating to products or facilities in addition such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs any or all of which could be significant we are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers ability to provide products to their customers 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites  we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins and steel while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers track customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

which could harm our reputation and financial results any of the cyberattacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above if significant could materially interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 2101 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 250 billion  of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

our ability to make scheduled payments refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations if we are unable to service our debt refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness merge or consolidate with other entities make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility the facility include a consolidated leverage ratio total debttoconsolidated ebitda and a consolidated interest coverage ratio consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as such terms are defined in the facility specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility it will maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 40 10 for the first and second quarters of 2018 and then stepping down to 35 10 for the third quarter of 2018 and thereafter the company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility it will maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 30 10 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

sales in 2017  were 2092 billion  an increase  of 264 billion  from 2016  sales increased   163 billion  due to acquisitions the favorable  effects of currency translation resulted in an increase  in revenues of 70 million  in 2017  aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation revenues increased   949 million   5  primarily due to increased demand sales to customers in each of the companys primary end markets grew sales growth was moderate in north america and europe and particularly strong in asia   

in 2017  total company operating income and operating income margin were 297 billion  and 142  respectively compared with 245 billion  and 134  respectively in 2016  the increase  in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases offset in part by an increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets due to recent acquisitions and strategic growth investments   the company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities including expansion of geographic sales reach and ecommerce platforms marketing initiatives focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience the company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi business system reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities and low cost region manufacturing   

the increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was principally due to a net provision of 204 million from the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017  the tax act  consisting primarily of a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the us statutory tax rate reduction although the net 204 million charge represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the tax act the components of the net charge are provisional and may change as discussed in note 7 in 2017 the company refinanced certain long term intercompany debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of 237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes in addition in 2017 the company recorded a 65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in singapore and 65 million of benefit associated with new required accounting for tax benefits from equity awards as discussed in note 1 the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to nonus subsidiaries in 2017 these nonus subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s us operations which resulted in no net tax cost as a result of these distributions the company benefitted from us foreign tax credits of 86 million offset in part by additional us income taxes of 53 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017 for a net benefit of 33 million the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the us during the reporting year and the us treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned the company intends to make similar types of distributions from nonus subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost the ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time accordingly the impact of foreign tax credits on the company’s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 20 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense   

the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016 in 2016 the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to nonus subsidiaries these nonus subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s us operations which resulted in no net tax cost as a result of these distributions the company benefitted from us foreign tax credits of 91 million  offset in part by additional us taxes of 37 million  on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016 for a net benefit of   54 million

the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 100 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense in addition the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling 39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of 12 million related to tax audits   

the effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 479 million and 663 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively   

the company expects its effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 6 and 9 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events   

income from continuing operations increased  to 223 billion  in 2017  from 203 billion  in 2016  the increase  in operating income in 2017  discussed above was offset in part by an increase  in interest expense of 123 million  primarily due to increases in outstanding debt to fund acquisitions and the increase in the tax provision in 2017  discussed above 

during 2017  the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 401 billion  compared with 326 billion  for 2016  the increase  primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2017 period and lower investment in working capital in 2017 

as of december 31 2017  the company’s shortterm debt totaled 214 billion  including 096 billion  of commercial paper obligations and 117 billion  of senior notes due within the next twelve months the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to 250 billion  of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit if the company borrows under this facility it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available as of december 31 2017  no  borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility although available capacity was reduced by approximately 77 million  as a result of outstanding letters of credit   

the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of 134 billion  as of december 31 2017  and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months   

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories business combinations intangible assets and goodwill sales returns income taxes contingencies and litigation and pension costs management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

 the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

the dates of acquisition definitelived intangible assets totaled 1541 billion  at december 31 2017  the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 2529 billion  and 127 billion  respectively at december 31 2017  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

for reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2018  and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2017  the date of the company’s impairment testing there can be no assurance however that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

with the completion of the patheon acquisition in august 2017 the company established a new reporting unit which solely consists of the legacy patheon business the book carrying value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date during its annual 2017 goodwill impairment assessment the company performed a qualitative assessment of this reporting unit and determined that no events had occurred and no circumstances had changed that would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount as a result the company did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit given that the fair value of the reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual 2017 assessment date relatively small decreases in future cash flows from anticipated results could result in impairment of goodwill the key variables that will drive the cash flows of the reporting unit will be levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate applied the business unit consisting of the legacy patheon business had 325 billion of goodwill and an overall carrying value of 733 billion as of december 31 2017 

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes the company’s reserve for these matters totaled 141 billion  at december 31 2017  

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s

level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit after consideration of all positive and negative evidence and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused in situations in which the company has been able to conclude that its deferred tax assets will be realized it has generally relied on future reversals of taxable temporary differences expected future taxable income where such estimates have historically been reliable and other factors if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 256 million  at december 31 2017  should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

the company has not provided state income or foreign withholding taxes on certain of its nonus subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies these business plans and tax strategies consider shortterm and longterm forecasts and budgets of the us parent and nonus subsidiaries working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated the company’s past practices regarding nonus subsidiary dividends sources of financing by the us parent such as issuing debt or equity and uses of cash by the us parent that are more discretionary in nature such as business combinations and share repurchase programs however should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its us subsidiaries including cash maintained by these nonus subsidiaries the company would recognize additional us tax liabilities it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional state and foreign withholding tax liabilities that the company would incur 

 the company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental workers’ compensation product general and auto liabilities and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on management’s judgment historical claims experience the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates accruals of acquired businesses including product liability and environmental accruals were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value additionally the company records receivables from thirdparty insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

 several of the company’s us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with thirdparty actuaries and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled 25 million  in 2017  the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled 486 million  at yearend 2017  compared with 610 million  at yearend 2016  should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation for example a 10 decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately 2 million  and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately 95 million  

as of december 31 2017  the company expects to contribute between 35  and 65 million  to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2018

the company reported other expense net of 539 million  and 425 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively note 4  interest expense increased   123 million  primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt 

provision for income taxes 

the increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was principally due to a net provision of 204 million from the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017  consisting primarily of a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the us statutory tax rate reduction although the net 204 million charge represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the tax act the components of the net charge are provisional and may change as discussed in note 7 in 2017 the company refinanced certain long term intercompany debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of 237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes in addition in 2017 the company recorded a 65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in singapore and 65 million of benefit associated with new required accounting for tax benefits from equity awards as discussed in note 1 the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to nonus subsidiaries in 2017 these nonus subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s us operations which resulted in no net tax cost as a result of these distributions the company benefitted from us foreign tax credits of 86 million offset in part by additional us income taxes of 53 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017 for a net benefit of 33 million the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the us during the reporting year and the us treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned the company intends to make similar types of distributions from nonus subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost the ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time accordingly the impact of foreign tax credits on the company’s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 20 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense 

the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016 in 2016 the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to nonus subsidiaries these nonus subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s us operations which resulted in no net tax cost as a result of these distributions the company benefitted from us foreign tax credits of 91 million  offset in part by additional us taxes of 37 million  on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016 for a net benefit of   54 million  the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 100 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense in addition the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling 39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of 12 million related to tax audits 

the effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for

income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 479 million and 663 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively 

the company expects its effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 6 and 9 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events 

the company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the us some of these countries have lower tax rates than the us the company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the us is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the us and on the statutory tax rates in those countries  based on the dispersion of the company’s nonus income tax provision among many countries the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income aside from any resulting onetime adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate

 reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of 141 billion  have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions 

the company has no material commitments for purchases of property plant and equipment other than those included in the above table but expects that for 2018  such expenditures will be between 700 and 730 million  

guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment see note 10  the residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of 155 million  the initial terms of these leases end in 2019 2020 and 2022 although renewal options exist for each 

a guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment the purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so the amount of the guarantee at december 31 2017  was 43 million

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities the company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixedrate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps additionally the company uses shortterm forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates such exposures result from purchases sales cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations the currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro british pounds sterling swedish kronor norwegian kroner swiss franc and canadian dollars income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

interest rates 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2017  the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings the fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2017  was 2162 billion  see note 12  fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity if interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2017  would increase by approximately 130 billion  if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2017  would decrease by approximately 120 billion  

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments including swap arrangements in 2017  a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variablerate debt would have increased the company’s annual pretax interest expense by approximately 44 million  

currency exchange rates 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in british pounds sterling swedish kronor euro canadian dollars danish kroner and swiss franc the effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders’ equity the company also uses foreign currencydenominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2017  functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 155 billion  

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2017  nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currencyexchange contracts of 130 million  a 10 appreciation in yearend 2017  nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 130 million  the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2017  nonfunctional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of 34 million  on the company’s net income

new products and research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments during 2016  2015  and 2014  we spent 755 million  692 million  and 691 million  respectively on research and development we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position 

raw materials 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in many aspects of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens 

working capital requirements 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

dependency on a single customer 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years

backlog 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2016  and 2015  was as follows 



we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2016  will be filled during 2017  

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

competition 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success primarily depends on the following factors 

 environmental matters 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

business continued 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites and are currently under the state’s licensed site remediation professional program as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site and in 2008 the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the us environmental protection agency usepa to complete a remedial investigationfeasibility study in 2011 our life technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the usepa and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former davis landfill superfund site in smithfield rhode island 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 49 million  at december 31 2016  

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulatory affairs 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in item 1 business under the caption forwardlooking statements 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards competitive factors include technological innovation price service and delivery breadth of product line customer support ebusiness capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth  some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

 we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate our business is affected by general economic conditions both inside and outside the us if the global economy and financial markets or economic conditions in europe the us or other key markets are unstable it could adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers distributors and suppliers having the effect of 

 demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 

spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget an impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2016  currency translation had an unfavorable  effect of 145 million  on revenues due to the strengthening  of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

significant developments stemming from the recent us presidential election or the uk’s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us  the new us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the united states particularly from china and mexico the new administration has also indicated an intention to request congress to make significant changes replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act and government negotiationregulation of drug prices paid by government programs changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business 

additionally on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union or eu this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom’s referendum in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the united kingdom these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the united kingdom’s actual or threatened withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and our customers’ businesses 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights our life technologies subsidiary is party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim we infringe their intellectual property note 10  we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

if our security products do not operate as designed and fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 2133 billion  and 134 billion  respectively as of december 31 2016  in addition we have definitelived intangible assets totaling 1263 billion  as of december 31 2016  we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired we assess the realizability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations and are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies for example some of our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the us food and drug administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products andor cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties 

our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins and steel while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers track

customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results any of the cyberattacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 1663 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 250 billion  of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

our ability to make scheduled payments refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations if we are unable to service our debt refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness merge or consolidate with other entities make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility and our term facility each a “facility” and together the “facilities” include a total debttoconsolidated ebitda ratio and an interest coverage ratio specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the revolving credit facility any letter of credit is outstanding under the revolving credit facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the revolving credit facility it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility the consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda to be greater than 45 to 10 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the first two consecutive quarters following the acquisition of fei see note 2  with such ratio stepping down to 40 to 10 for the two immediately following fiscal quarters and then stepping down to 35 to 10 for each fiscal quarter thereafter the company’s term facility includes consolidated leverage ratio covenants substantively the same as the covenant included in the revolving credit facility 

the company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the revolving credit facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the revolving credit facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under any facility including the term loan and bridge facilities it will not permit the consolidated interest coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense to be less than 30 to 10 as at the last day of any fiscal quarter 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

recent acquisitions and divestitures 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions the company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below 

on february 3 2014 the company completed the acquisition of life technologies corporation for a total purchase price of 1530 billion net of cash acquired including the assumption of 228 billion of debt the company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption “liquidity and capital resources” life technologies was integrated into the life sciences solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis as well as those in applied markets such as forensics and food safety testing life technologies’ revenues totaled 387 billion in 2013 

on march 21 2014 the company sold its legacy sera and media gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to ge healthcare for 106 billion net of cash divested the sale of these businesses resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 761 million included in restructuring and other costs income net the businesses fell principally in the life sciences solutions segment divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the life technologies acquisition revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately 250 million and 64 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2013 and 61 million and 12 million respectively in 2014 through the date of sale

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

sales in 2016  were 1827 billion  an increase  of 131 billion  from 2015  sales increased   733 million  due to acquisitions the unfavorable  effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease  in revenues of 145 million  in 2016  aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions revenues increased   721 million   4  primarily due to increased demand sales to customers in the company’s primary end markets grew demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong sales growth was strong in asia moderate in europe and modest in north america  based on the weakening of currency exchange rates against the us dollar that occurred in 2016 the company currently expects that there will be a continued adverse effect on reported amounts of revenue and operating income in 2017 as a result of the stronger us dollar 

in 2016  total company operating income and operating income margin were 245 billion  and 134  respectively compared with 234 billion  and 138  respectively in 2015  the increase  in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases and to a lesser extent acquisitions these increases were offset in part by higher restructuring and acquisitionrelated charges in the 2016 period strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix  the company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities including expansion of geographic sales reach and ecommerce platforms marketing initiatives focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience the company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi business system reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities and low cost region manufacturing 

the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016 in 2016 the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to nonus subsidiaries these nonus subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s us operations which resulted in no net tax cost as a result of these distributions the company benefitted from us foreign tax credits of 91 million  offset in part by additional us taxes of 37 million  on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016 for a net benefit of   54 million  the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the us during the reporting year and the us treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned the company intends to make similar types of distributions from nonus subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost the ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time accordingly the impact of foreign tax credits on the company’s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 100 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense in addition the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling 39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of 12 million related to tax audits   

the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015 in 2015 the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to nonus subsidiaries these nonus subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s us operations which resulted in no net tax cost as a result of these distributions the company benefitted from us foreign tax credits of 111 million offset in part by additional us taxes of 46 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015 for a net benefit of 66 million the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the us during the reporting year and the us treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 80 million of foreign tax credits with no related

incremental us income tax expense in addition the company recorded discrete benefits totaling 54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of life technologies the tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by 37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates the effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 663 million and 477 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively   

the company expects its effective tax rate in 2017 will be less than 3 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits   

income from continuing operations increased  to 203 billion  in 2016  from 198 billion  in 2015  the increase  in operating income in the 2016  period discussed above was offset in part by an increase  in interest expense of 55 million  primarily due to increases in outstanding debt to fund acquisitions and a lower tax benefit from income taxes in 2016 

during 2016  the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 316 billion  compared with 282 billion  for 2015  the increase  primarily resulted from lower investments in working capital and higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2016 period 

as of december 31 2016  the company’s shortterm debt totaled 126 billion  including 300 million  due within the next twelve months under a 3year term loan agreement and 953 million  of commercial paper obligations the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to 250 billion  of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit if the company borrows under this facility it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available as of december 31 2016  no  borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility although available capacity was reduced by approximately 72 million  as a result of outstanding letters of credit   

the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of 786 million  as of december 31 2016  and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months   

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories business combinations intangible assets and goodwill sales returns income taxes contingencies and litigation and pension costs management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

 the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due such allowances totaled 77 million  at december 31 2016  the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate reducing their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required 

 the company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand additional writedowns may be required 

 the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition definitelived intangible assets totaled 1263 billion  at december 31 2016  the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 2133 billion  and 134 billion  respectively at december 31 2016  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2017  and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2016  the date of the company’s impairment testing there can be no assurance however that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

with the completion of the fei acquisition in september 2016 the company established a new reporting unit called materials and structural analysis which consists of the former fei business because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business the book value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date no cushion of fair value over book value existed at the acquisition date during its 2016 goodwill impairment testing the company determined that the materials and structural analysis reporting unit’s cushion of fair value over book value was nominal as of november 5 2016 given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill the key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the weighted average cost of capital wacc rate applied the estimates used for these assumptions represent managements best estimates which the company believes are reasonable these assumptions however are subject to uncertainty including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels the materials and structural analysis reporting unit had 199 billion of goodwill and had an overall carrying value of 393 billion as of december 31 2016 

 in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change the company’s revenue recognition would be affected 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition 

and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

in instances where the company sells equipment with customerspecified acceptance criteria the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition if the nature of customerspecified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers should a greater or lesser number of products be returned additional adjustments to revenue may be required 

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company’s reserve for these matters totaled 802 million  at december 31 2016  where applicable associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes 

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 113 million  at december 31 2016  should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result 

the company operates in various jurisdictions around the world with the exception of its affymetrix singapore subsidiary the company has not provided income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its nonus subsidiaries due to its intention to permanently reinvest such earnings unless the company can remit such earnings to the us without associated net tax cost the company recorded a deferred tax liability of 156 million  in acquisition accounting for the outside basis difference of affymetrix singapore as the company intends to integrate it with the company’s existing singapore operations within the next twelve months aside from this plan the company’s intent is to only make distributions from nonus subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost 

 the company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental workers’ compensation product general and auto liabilities and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on management’s judgment historical claims experience the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates accruals of acquired businesses including product liability and environmental accruals were initially recorded at fair value and

discounted to their net present value additionally the company records receivables from thirdparty insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

 several of the company’s us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with thirdparty actuaries and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled 34 million  in 2016  the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled 610 million  at yearend 2016  compared with 528 million  at yearend 2015  should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation for example a 10 decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately 2 million  and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately 93 million  

as of december 31 2016  the company expects to contribute between 215  and 235 million  to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2017  

as of january 1 2017 the company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other retiree benefit plans historically the company estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing the single weightedaverage discount rate used to measure each plans benefit obligation at the beginning of the year beginning in 2017 the company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spotrates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows the company has made this change to provide a more precise measurement of the service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates the company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and will account for it prospectively starting in january 2017 the reduction in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change in estimate will be approximately 10 million

guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment see note 10  the residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of 155 million  the initial terms of these leases end in 2019 2020 and 2022 although renewal options exist for each 

a guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment the purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so the amount of the guarantee at december 31 2016  was 40 million  

in disposing of assets or businesses the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including for example unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees the company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions however the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position annual results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities the company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixedrate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps additionally the company uses shortterm forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates such exposures result from purchases sales cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations the currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro british pounds sterling swiss franc japanese yen norwegian kroner and swedish kronor income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

interest rates 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2016  the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings the fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2016  was 1698 billion  see note 12  fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity if interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2016  would increase by approximately 840 million  if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2016  would decrease by approximately 802 million  

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments including swap arrangements in 2016  a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variablerate debt would have increased the company’s annual pretax interest expense by approximately 42 million  

currency exchange rates 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in british pounds sterling swedish kronor euro danish kroner canadian dollars and swiss franc the effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity the company also uses foreign currencydenominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2016  functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 119 billion  

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2016  nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currencyexchange contracts of 126 million  a 10 appreciation in yearend 2016  nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 117 million  the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2016  nonfunctional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of 36 million  on the company’s net income

development we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position 

raw materials 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

rawmaterial and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in all segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens 

working capital requirements 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

dependency on a single customer 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years 

backlog 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2015  and 2014  was as follows 



backlog at yearend 2015 compared to the 2014 balance was affected by unfavorable currency translation we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2015  will be filled during 2016  

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results

competition 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success primarily depends on the following factors 

 environmental matters 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites and are currently under the state’s licensed site remediation professional program as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site and in 2008 the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the us environmental protection agency usepa to complete a remedial investigationfeasibility study in 2011 our life technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the usepa and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former davis landfill superfund site in smithfield rhode island 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 35 million  at december 31 2015  

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of

operations or cash flows however we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulatory affairs 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

risk factors 

tableend set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in item 1 business under the caption forwardlooking statements 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards competitive factors include technological innovation price service and delivery breadth of product line customer support ebusiness capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth  some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

 we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate our business is affected by general economic conditions both inside and outside the us if the global economy and financial markets or economic conditions in europe the us or other key markets are unstable it could adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers distributors and suppliers having the effect of 

 for example recent developments in europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations this debt crisis could result in customers in europe taking longer to pay for products they have purchased from us or being unable to pay at all the continued weakness in world

risk factors continued 

economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further 

demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 

spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget an impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending in fiscal year 2013 the us government was unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the budget control act of 2011 as a result in early 2013 an enforcement mechanism known as sequestration went into effect which triggered one year of budget reductions in subsequent years statutory spending caps have constrained federal funding levels despite agreement not to impose similar cuts in fiscal years 2014 through 2017 it is possible that congress will allow similar cuts to occur again in fiscal year 2018 and beyond 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2015  currency translation had an unfavorable  effect of 938 million  on revenues due to the strengthening  of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services for 2016  the company is expecting a significant negative impact on revenues and operating income due to the stronger us dollar 

healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us the patient protection and affordable care act could have an adverse impact on us some of the potential consequences such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights with our acquisition of life technologies we became party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim we infringe their intellectual property note 10  we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making

risk factors continued 

these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

if our security products do not operate as designed and fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 1883 billion  and 125 billion  respectively as of december 31 2015  in addition we have definitelived intangible assets totaling 1151 billion  as of december 31 2015  we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired we assess the realizability of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations and are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies for example some of our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the us food and drug administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products andor cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products  in 2012 the sec adopted a rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the rule requires an annual disclosure report to be filed and requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tantalum tin gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we undertake which may harm our reputation in addition we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

risk factors continued 

tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins and steel while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations  as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers track customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results 

our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 1253 billion  in outstanding indebtedness in addition we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 200 billion  of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

our ability to make scheduled payments refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations if we are unable to service our debt refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility include a total debttoebitda ratio and an interest coverage ratio specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the facility the consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 35  to 10 or the consolidated interest coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense to be less than 30  to 10 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend reference is made throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page f1 of this report 

overview 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses the company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments see note 3  life sciences solutions analytical instruments specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services 

recent acquisitions and divestitures 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions the company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below 

on february 3 2014 the company completed the acquisition of life technologies corporation for a total purchase price of 1530 billion net of cash acquired including the assumption of 228 billion of debt the company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption “liquidity and capital resources” life technologies was integrated into the life sciences solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis as well as those in applied markets such as forensics and food safety testing life technologies’ revenues totaled 387 billion in 2013 

on march 21 2014 the company sold its legacy sera and media gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to ge healthcare for 106 billion net of cash divested the sale of these businesses resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 761 million included in restructuring and other costs income net the businesses fell principally in the life sciences solutions segment divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the life technologies acquisition revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately 250 million and 64 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2013 and 61 million and 12 million respectively in 2014 through the date of sale 

on august 15 2014 the company sold its coleparmer specialty channel business part of the laboratory products and services segment for 480 million in cash net of cash divested the sale of this business resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 134 million included in restructuring and other costs income net revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately 232 million and 43 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2013 and 149 million and 28 million respectively in 2014 through the date of sale 

on february 4 2015 the company acquired advanced scientifics inc a north americabased global provider of singleuse technologies for customized bioprocessing solutions for approximately 289 million advanced scientifics was integrated into the life sciences solutions segment and expands the company’s bioprocessing offerings revenues of advanced scientifics were approximately 80 million in 2014 

on september 30 2015 the company acquired within the laboratory products and services segment alfa aesar a ukbased global manufacturer of research chemicals from johnson matthey plc for £257 million   392 million  in cash the acquisition expands the company’s existing portfolio of chemicals solvents and reagents revenues of alfa aesar were approximately £78 million  in 2014 

in january 2016 the company signed an agreement to acquire within the life sciences solutions segment affymetrix inc a north americabased provider of cellular and genetic analysis products for approximately 13 billion  in cash the acquisition will expand the companys existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for highgrowth flow cytometry and singlecell biology applications revenues of affymetrix were 360 million  in 2015 the transaction which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2016 is subject to the approval of affymetrix shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals the company expects to issue debt in advance of closing the acquisition of affymetrix to partially fund the acquisition

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition 

and results of operations 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

sales in 2015  were 1697 billion  an increase  of 76 million  from 2014  the unfavorable  effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease  in revenues of 938 million  in 2015  sales increased   212 million  due to acquisitions net of divestitures aside from the effects of currency translation acquisitions and divestitures revenues increased   803 million   5  primarily due to increased demand sales to customers in the company’s primary end markets grew demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong while sales to industrial markets and academic and government markets grew modestly in 2015  sales growth was moderate in north america and europe and strong in asia revenues and operating income of the company’s nonus operations are translated into us dollars to report consolidated results based on weakening of currency exchange rates against the us dollar that occurred in 2015  and early 2016 the company currently expects that there will be a continued adverse effect on reported amounts of revenues and operating income in 2016  as a result of the stronger us dollar 

in 2015  total company operating income and operating income margin were 234 billion  and 138  respectively compared with 250 billion  and 148  respectively in 2014  the decrease  in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of 895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014 offset in part by 450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the february 2014 acquisition of life technologies the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability these factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases and to a lesser extent profit on higher sales in local currencies  the company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi business system reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities and low cost region manufacturing 

the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015 in 2015 the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to nonus subsidiaries these initiatives resulted in additional foreign tax credits of 111 million offset in part by additional us income taxes of 46 million on the related foreign income net benefit of 66 million which reduced the company’s effective rate by 34 percentage points the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in 80 million of foreign tax credits with no related incremental us income tax expense in addition the company recorded tax benefits totaling 54 million or 28 percentage points related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of life technologies the tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by 37 million or 19 percentage points as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates the effective tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 477 million and 586 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate was 92 in 2014 the 2014 provision for income taxes included 390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses aside from the discrete tax on the gains the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of life technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits in 2014 nonus subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s us operations which resulted in no net tax cost as a result of these distributions the company generated us foreign tax credits of 172 million offset in part by additional us income taxes of 55 million on the related foreign income the net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by 117 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 56 percentage points in 2014 the federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by 20 million or 10 percentage point in 2014 the company recognized a discrete

tax benefit of 15 million or 07 percentage points attributable to tax rulings related to nonus subsidiaries the tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by 55 million or 03 percentage points as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates   

the company expects its effective tax rate in 2016 will be less than 3 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits   

income from continuing operations increased  to 198 billion  in 2015  from 190 billion  in 2014  the decrease  in operating income in the 2015  period discussed above was more than offset by an increase in the income tax benefit in the 2015  period discussed above and a decrease  in interest expense of 65 million  primarily due to a reduction in outstanding debt and effective interest rates 

during 2015  the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 282 billion  compared with 262 billion  for 2014  the increase  resulted from cash disbursements in the 2014 period totaling 325 million related to the acquisition of life technologies including severance obligations thirdparty transactionintegration costs and monetizing certain equity awards held by life technologies employees at the date of acquisition offset in part by lower payments in 2014 for incentive compensation as a result of life technologies having paid its annual incentive compensation prior to the acquisition 

as of december 31 2015  the company’s shortterm debt totaled 105 billion  including 100 billion  of senior notes due in the next twelve months and 50 million  of commercial paper obligations the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to 200 billion  of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit if the company borrows under this facility it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available as of december 31 2015  no  borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility although available capacity was reduced by approximately 65 million  as a result of outstanding letters of credit 

the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of 452 million  as of december 31 2015  and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories business combinations intangible assets and goodwill sales returns income taxes contingencies and litigation and pension costs management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

 the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due such allowances totaled 70 million  at december 31 2015  the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate reducing their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required 

 the company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand additional writedowns may be required 

 the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition definitelived intangible assets totaled 1151 billion  at december 31 2015  the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 1883 billion  and 125 billion  respectively at december 31 2015  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

projections of profitability for 2016  and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2015  the date of the company’s impairment testing there can be no assurance however that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

 in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change the company’s revenue recognition would be affected 

in instances where the company sells equipment with customerspecified acceptance criteria the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition if the nature of customerspecified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers should a greater or lesser number of products be returned additional adjustments to revenue may be required 

 in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest

amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company’s reserve for these matters totaled 350 million  at december 31 2015  where applicable associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes 

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 109 million  at december 31 2015  should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result 

 the company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental workers’ compensation product general and auto liabilities and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on management’s judgment historical claims experience the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates accruals of acquired businesses including product liability and environmental accruals were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value additionally the company records receivables from thirdparty insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

 several of the company’s us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with thirdparty actuaries and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled 29 million  in 2015  the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled 528 million  at yearend 2015  compared with 540 million  at yearend 2014  should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation for example a 10 decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately 2 million  and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately 102 million  

as of december 31 2015  the company expects to contribute between 30  and 50 million  to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2016

 reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of 350 million  have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions 

the company has no material commitments for purchases of property plant and equipment other than those included in the above table but expects that for 2016  such expenditures will approximate 415 to 430 million  

guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for two facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment see note 10  the residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of 111 million  the initial terms of these leases end in 2019 and 2020 although renewal options exist for each

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities the company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixedrate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps additionally the company uses shortterm forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates such exposures result from purchases sales cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations the currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro british pounds sterling swiss franc japanese yen norwegian kroner and swedish kronor income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements 

interest rates 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2015  the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings the fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2015  was 1268 billion  see note 12  fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity if interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2015  would increase by approximately 630 million  if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2015  would decrease by approximately 581 million  

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments including swap arrangements in 2015  a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements would have increased the company’s annual pretax interest expense by approximately 33 million  

currency exchange rates 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in british pounds sterling swedish kronor euro danish kroner and canadian dollars the effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity the company also uses foreign currencydenominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2015  functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 111 billion  

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2015  nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currencyexchange contracts of 6 million  a 10 appreciation in yearend 2015  nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 9 million  the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2015  non

new products and research and development 

 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments during 2014 2013 and 2012 we spent 691 million 396 million and 376 million respectively on research and development we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position 

 

raw materials 

 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

 

rawmaterial and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

 

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

patents are important in all segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

 

seasonal influences 

 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period’s airborne pollen allergens 

 

working capital requirements 

 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

 

dependency on a single customer 

 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years

backlog 

 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2014 and 2013 was as follows 

 

 

we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2014 will be filled during 2015 

 

government contracts 

 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

 

competition 

 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success primarily depends on the following factors 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements

thermo fisher scientific inc 

  

business continued 

  

  a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

 

  our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites and are currently under the state’s licensed site remediation professional program as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site and in 2008 the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the us environmental protection agency usepa to complete a remedial investigationfeasibility study in 2011 our life technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the usepa and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former davis landfill superfund site in smithfield rhode island 

 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 32 million at december 31 2014 

 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

regulatory affairs 

 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations

  we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

raw materials 

 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

 

rawmaterial and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

 

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

patents are important in all segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

 

seasonal influences 

 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of airborne pollen allergens 

 

working capital requirements 

 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

 

dependency on a single customer 

 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2013 and 2012 was as follows 

 

 

we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2013 will be filled during 2014 the table above does not include backlog of life technologies which was acquired on february 3 2014

government contracts 

 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

 

competition 

 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors in general competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 our rockford illinois facility is subject to a resource conservation and recovery act rcra corrective action program administered by the illinois environmental protection agency we are required to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site

business continued 

 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 29 million at december 31 2013 the liability for environmental matters associated with fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value 

 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

our recently acquired life technologies subsidiary also has certain environmental liabilities including from its prior acquisitions such as obligations for the cleanup of formerlyowned locations as well as several hazardous waste sites under state and federal environmental laws in connection with its acquisitions of dexter corporation in 2000 and applied biosystems in 2008 life technologies has reserves accrued for these matters unexpected results related to the investigation and cleanup of any of these sites could cause our financial exposure in these matters to exceed stated reserves requiring us to allocate additional funds and other resources to address these environmental liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

regulatory affairs 

 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the food and drug administration and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

overview 

 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses the company’s continuing operations fall into three business segments see note 3 analytical technologies specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services 

 

recent and pending acquisitions and divestitures 

 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2012 and its 2014 acquisition of life technologies the company’s principal 2012 acquisitions are described below 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition on april 14 2013 the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with life technologies providing for the acquisition of life technologies by the company the “life technologies acquisition” at a price of approximately 136 billion in cash 761311786 per share plus the assumption of certain life technologies indebtedness note 2 life technologies provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis as well as those in applied markets such as forensics and food safety testing life technologies’ revenues totaled 39 billion in 2013 the acquisition was completed on february 3 2014 life technologies will be reported in a new segment life sciences solutions together with most of the company’s existing biosciences businesses 

 

the company completed its permanent financing arrangements for the life technologies acquisition in december 2013 the financing consists of a term loan agreement the “term credit facility” proceeds from issuance of senior debt and commercial paper proceeds from equity forward agreements and cash on hand these arrangements are discussed below under the caption “liquidity and capital resources” 

 

in december 2013 the company entered an agreement to sell its sera and media gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to ge healthcare for approximately 106 billion the businesses fall principally in the analytical technologies segment divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the life technologies acquisition as of december 31 2013 the agreement to sell the businesses was contingent on among other things obtaining antitrust approval for the acquisition of life technologies that approval was obtained in january 2014 at which time these businesses were designated as held for sale revenues and operating income in 2013 of the businesses to be sold were approximately 250 million and 80 million respectively the sale is subject to additional regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 

 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

 

in february 2013 in connection with a change in management responsibility for two product lines with aggregate annual revenues of approximately 100 million the company transferred its water analysis and research serum and media product lines to the laboratory products and services segment from the analytical technologies segment the company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect these transfers

new products and research and development 

 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments we are not currently committed to any new products that require the investment of a material amount of our funds nor do we have any definitive plans to enter new businesses that would require such an investment 

 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 we spent 376 million 340 million and 284 million respectively on research and development 

 

raw materials 

 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

 

rawmaterial and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

 

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

patents are important in all three segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

 

seasonal influences 

 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of airborne pollen allergens 

 

working capital requirements 

 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital

dependency on a single customer 

 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2012 and 2011 was as follows 

 

 

we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2012 will be filled during 2013 

 

government contracts 

 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

 

competition 

 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors in general competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

 

financial statement index 

  

  

thermo fisher scientific inc 

 

business continued 

 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 our rockford illinois facility is subject to a resource conservation and recovery act rcra corrective action program administered by the illinois environmental protection agency we are required to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site 

 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 23 million at december 31 2012 the liability for environmental matters associated with fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value 

 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

regulatory affairs 

 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the food and drug administration and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

 item 1a risk factors 

 

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements beginning on page 4 

 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards competitive factors include technological innovation price service and delivery breadth of product line customer support ebusiness capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business

risk factors continued 

  

  our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate our business is affected by general economic conditions both inside and outside the us if the global economy and financial markets or economic conditions in europe the us or other key markets are unstable it could adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers distributors and suppliers having the effect of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example recent developments in europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations this debt crisis and related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to deteriorate reducing the purchasing power of our european customers and reducing our us dollar revenues as translated from the euro in addition the european crisis could result in customers in europe taking longer to pay for products they have purchased from us or being unable to pay at all the continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further 

 

demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 

 

spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget an impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending the us government has been unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the budget control act of 2011 unless congress and the administration take further action an enforcement mechanism known as sequestration will trigger a total of 12 trillion in spending reductions over the next decade divided between domestic and defense spending as a result government funding would be reduced for certain of our customers including those who are dependent on funding from the national institutes of health which would likely have a significant effect on these entities’ spending policies these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 

 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2011 currency translation had a favorable effect of 244 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services and in 2012 currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of 227 million

risk factors continued 

healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act could have an adverse impact on us some of the potential consequences such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services 

 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

 

if our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our

product which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

 

our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 1247 billion and 134 billion respectively as of december 31 2012 we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

 

because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory products business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability  we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one of these thirdparty packagedelivery

provider experiences a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

 

we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations and are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies for example some of our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the us food and drug administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products andor cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties 

 

new regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products on august 22 2012 the sec adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured the new rule which is effective for 2013 and requires a disclosure report to be filed by may 31 2014 will require companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country the new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tantalum tin gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities as our supply chain is complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation in addition we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 

 

our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

  we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins and steel while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers track customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm our systems when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results 

 

our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 712 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition on april 11 2012 we terminated our prior revolving credit agreements and entered into new revolving credit facilities that provide for up to 20 billion of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations if we are unable to service our debt refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures recent disruptions in the financial markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions and reduced lending activity may adversely affect the availability terms and cost of credit in the future we cannot be sure that initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will continue to stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to us 

 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facilities include a total debttoebitda ratio specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under either facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under either facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility that supports letters of credit it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the facility the consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 35 to 10

reference is made throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page f1 of this report 

 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses the company’s continuing operations fall into three business segments see note 3 analytical technologies specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services 

 

the results of two businesses sold in april 2011 and a business sold in october 2012 have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation the results discussed below refer to the company’s continuing operations unless otherwise noted 

 

 

sales in 2012 were 1251 billion an increase of 951 million from 2011 the increase was due to acquisitions including phadia and dionex and higher sales at existing businesses offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation had phadia dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011 revenues would have increased 403 million 3 over pro forma 2011 revenues aside from the effects of currency translation and other acquisitions net of divestitures revenues in 2012 increased 474 million 4 over pro forma 2011 revenues discussed in total and by segment below the pro forma increase in revenues was primarily due to increased demand demand from customers in academic and government markets slowed such that growth was nominal in 2012 and demand from customers in industrial markets slowed such that growth was nominal in the second half of 2012 the company expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue in the near term due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the us and europe the company expects slowness in industrial markets will continue in the near term due to global economic uncertainty 

 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2012 and 2011 the company’s principal recent acquisitions are described below

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

overview of results of operations and liquidity continued 

 

 

 

in 2012 total company operating income and operating income margin were 148 billion and 118 respectively compared with 125 billion and 108 respectively in 2011 the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses and to a lesser extent productivity improvements net of inflationary cost increases and 84 million of lower acquisitionrelated charges in 2012 the increase was offset in part by commercial investments and an increase in amortization expense of 100 million in 2012 primarily related to the acquisitions of phadia and dionex the company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi processes reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities 

 

the company’s effective tax rates were 09 and 97 in 2012 and 2011 respectively due primarily to the nondeductibility of intangible asset amortization the company’s cash payments for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled 331 million and 353 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate was due in part to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the phadia acquisition the tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by 53 million or 41 percentage points as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates particularly a lower tax rate in sweden the tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by 12 million or 10 percentage points as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates offset in part by 8 million or 07 percentage points by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the phadia acquisition the company expects its effective tax rate in 2013 will be between 5 and 7 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business the tax provision in 2013 will benefit from an estimated 13 million of us tax credits for research and development activities in both 2012 and 2013 as a result of legislation enacted in january 2013 

 

income from continuing operations increased to 126 billion in 2012 from 102 billion in 2011 primarily due to increased operating income and lower income taxes offset in part by higher interest expense associated with debt to fund acquisitions 

 

during 2012 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 204 billion after deducting 28 million used by discontinued operations compared with 169 billion including 14 million from discontinued operations for 2011 the increase resulted primarily from higher income before amortization and depreciation in 2012 compared to 2011 

 

as of december 31 2012 the company’s shortterm debt totaled 93 million including 50 million of commercial paper obligations the company has revolving credit facilities with a bank group that provide up to 20 billion of unsecured multicurrency revolving credit the credit facilities include a 1 billion 5year credit agreement with the ability to request an additional 500 million plus a 500 million 364day credit agreement if the company borrows under these facilities it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available as of december 31 2012 no borrowings were outstanding under either facility although available capacity was reduced by approximately 50 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit 

 

the company believes that its existing cash and shortterm investments of 855 million as of december 31 2012 and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreements are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories business combinations intangible assets and goodwill equity investments sales returns warranty obligations income taxes contingencies and litigation pension costs and stockbased compensation management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

 

a accounts receivable 

 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due such allowances totaled 56 million at december 31 2012 the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate reducing their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required 

 

b inventories 

 

the company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand additional writedowns may be required 

 

c intangible assets and goodwill 

 

the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition definitelived intangible assets totaled 646 billion at december 31 2012 the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 1247 billion and 134 billion respectively at december 31 2012 estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

 

growth at some of the company’s businesses slowed in 2011 and 2012 which the company believes was in part due to uncertainty in funding expectations of customers in academic and government markets and economic uncertainty including a slowdown in southern europe projections of profitability for 2013 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2012 the date of the company’s impairment testing there can be no assurance however that the slowing of growth experienced in 2011 and 2012 at some businesses will not continue or worsen in 2013 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

 

the company’s immunodiagnostics reporting unit was created with the acquisition of the phadia group in august 2011 because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business its book value equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date and thus no cushion of fair value over book value existed at that date during its 2012 goodwill impairment testing the company determined that the immunodiagnostics reporting unit’s cushion of fair value over book value had increased from 0 at the acquisition date to 9 as of november 2 2012 despite this favorable increase given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill the key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the weighted average cost of capital wacc rate applied the estimates used for these assumptions represent managements best estimates which the company believes are reasonable these assumptions however are subject to uncertainty including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels the immunodiagnostics reporting unit had 178 billion of goodwill and had an overall carrying value of 330 billion as of december 31 2012 

 

d other longlived assets 

 

the company reviews other longlived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets other longlived assets totaled 233 billion at december 31 2012 including 173 billion of fixed assets in testing a longlived asset for impairment assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and assetrelated expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts charges for impairment of other longlived assets may be necessary

   e revenues 

 

in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change the company’s revenue recognition would be affected 

 

in instances where the company sells equipment with customerspecified acceptance criteria the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition if the nature of customerspecified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 

 

the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” the company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered elements in the event vsoe is not available for any undelivered element revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than postcontract support is completed revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed based on vsoe which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately 

 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers should a greater or lesser number of products be returned additional adjustments to revenue may be required 

 

f warranty obligations 

 

at the time the company recognizes revenue it provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns the liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled 49 million at december 31 2012 should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 

 

g income taxes 

 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company’s reserve for these matters totaled 165 million at december 31 2012 where applicable associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income 

 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 114 million at december 31 2012 should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

 

the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result 

 

h contingencies and litigation 

 

the company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental workers’ compensation product general and auto liabilities and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on management’s judgment historical claims experience the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates reserves of acquired businesses including product liability and environmental reserves were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value additionally the company records receivables from thirdparty insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

 

i pension and other retiree benefits 

 

several of the company’s us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with thirdparty actuaries and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled 17 million in 2012 the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled 408 million at yearend 2012 compared with 346 million at yearend 2011 should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation for example a 10 decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately 11 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately 77 million 

 

the company expects to contribute between 60 and 70 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2013

  j stockbased compensation 

 

the fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model for option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions a lattice model is used to estimate fair value use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant the dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent quarterly dividend rate changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stockbased compensation the compensation expense recognized for all stockbased awards is net of estimated forfeitures the company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures if actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures adjustments to compensation expense may be required

provision for income taxes 

 

the company’s effective tax rates were 97 and 93 in 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the items discussed below offset in part by increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the phadia acquisition the tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by 12 million or 10 percentage points as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates offset in part by 8 million or 07 percentage points by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the phadia acquisition the tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by 17 million or 16 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates

new products and research and development 

 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments we are not currently committed to any new products that require the investment of a material amount of our funds nor do we have any definitive plans to enter new businesses that would require such an investment 

 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we spent 341 million 285 million and 244 million respectively on research and development 

 

raw materials 

 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

 

rawmaterial and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

 

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

patents are important in all three segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow

seasonal influences 

 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of flu season sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of airborne pollen allergens 

 

working capital requirements 

 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

 

dependency on a single customer 

 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2011 and 2010 was as follows 

 

 

we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2011 will be filled during 2012 

 

government contracts 

 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

 

competition 

 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors in general competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 our rockford illinois facility is subject to a resource conservation and recovery act rcra corrective action program administered by the illinois environmental protection agency we are required to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site 

 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 22 million at december 31 2011 the liability for environmental matters associated with fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value 

 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

regulatory affairs 

 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the food and drug administration and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

 item 1a risk factors 

 

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements beginning on page 4 

 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business

risk factors continued 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate our business is affected by general economic conditions both inside and outside the us if the global economy and financial markets or economic conditions in europe the us or other key markets are unstable it could adversely affect the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers distributors and suppliers having the effect of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example recent developments in europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations this debt crisis and related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to deteriorate reducing the purchasing power of our european customers and reducing our us dollar revenues as translated from the euro in addition the european crisis could result in customers in europe taking longer to pay for products they have purchased from us or being unable to pay at all the continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further 

 

demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 

 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2010 currency translation had an unfavorable effect of 19 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services but in 2011 currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of 266 million due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

 

healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us the recently enacted federal legislation on healthcare reform could have an adverse impact on us some of the potential consequences such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services the new legislation also includes an excise tax beginning in 2013 on revenue from the sale by manufacturers of certain medical devices which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations

risk factors continued 

 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

 

if our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all

our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 1199 billion and 133 billion respectively as of december 31 2011 we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

 

because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory products business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability  we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one of these thirdparty packagedelivery provider experiences a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected

we are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations including those regarding the manufacture of products the shipping of our products and environmental matters some of our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the us food and drug administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

 

we are subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern the handling transportation manufacture use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture sell or distribute this requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations including the establishment of reserves to address potential environmental costs and manage environmental risks 

 

our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins and steel while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers track customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks unauthorized access to customer or employee data and other attempts to harm our systems when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results

our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 703 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to borrow an additional 951 million under our revolving credit facility and an additional 100 million under another revolver that supports our commercial paper program we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations if we are unable to service our debt refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures recent disruptions in the financial markets including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions and reduced lending activity may adversely affect the availability terms and cost of credit in the future we cannot be sure that initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will continue to stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to us 

 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility include a total debttoebitda ratio specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the facility the consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 35 to 10 

 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

reference is made throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page f1 of this report 

 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses beginning in the third quarter of 2011 the company’s continuing operations fall into three business segments see note 3 analytical technologies specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services prior period segment results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation 

 

the results of two businesses sold on april 4 2011 have been classified and presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation the results discussed below refer to the company’s continuing operations unless otherwise noted 

 

 

sales in 2011 were 1173 billion an increase of 116 billion from 2010 the increase was due to acquisitions including phadia and dionex and to a lesser extent higher sales at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation had phadia dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010 pro forma revenues would have increased 787 million 7 over pro forma 2010 revenues aside from the effects of currency translation and other acquisitions net of divestitures pro forma revenues increased 389 million 3 over pro forma 2010 revenues discussed in total and by segment below the increase in pro forma revenues was primarily due to increased demand offset in part by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract discussed below and lower stimulusfunded sales in japan as compared to 2010 which together decreased sales by approximately one percentage point the company had lower sales to academic and government markets in the second half of 2011 which it believes may be due to uncertainty in funding expectations in the us and europe these markets represent approximately a quarter of the company’s revenues and the decrease in sales to this customer base reduced the company’s overall growth in the second half of 2011 by approximately one percentage point although the decline moderated in the fourth quarter the company currently expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue into 2012 

 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2011 and 2010 the company’s principal recent acquisitions are described below

in 2011 operating income and operating income margin were 125 billion and 106 respectively compared with 121 billion and 114 respectively in 2010 the decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to 124 million of higher acquisitionrelated charges and an increase in amortization expense of 93 million in 2011 primarily related to the acquisitions of phadia and dionex the decrease in operating margin was offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses the company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi processes reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities 

 

the company’s effective tax rates were 95 and 98 in 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the phadia acquisition the tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by 12 million or 10 percentage points as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates offset in part by 8 million or 07 percentage points by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the phadia acquisition the tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by 17 million or 16 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates the company expects its effective tax rate in 2012 will be between 115 to 135 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business 

 

income from continuing operations increased to 102 billion in 2011 from 997 million in 2010 primarily due to increased operating income offset in part by higher other expense net primarily interest expense as a result of borrowings to partially fund acquisitions 

 

on april 4 2011 the company sold in separate transactions its athena diagnostics business athena for 740 million in cash and its lancaster laboratories business lancaster for 180 million in cash and escrowed proceeds of 20 million due in october 2012 the sale of these businesses resulted in an aftertax gain in discontinued operations of 304 million or 079 per diluted share 

 

during 2011 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 169 billion including 13 million from discontinued operations compared with 150 billion including 45 million from discontinued operations for 2010 the increase resulted primarily from higher income before amortization and depreciation offset in part by growth in working capital items in 2011 compared to 2010 

 

as of december 31 2011 the company’s shortterm debt totaled 127 billion principally commercial paper obligations and 354 million of senior notes due december 2012 under its principal unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in august 2012 the company has available capacity of 951 million at december 31 2011 in addition the company has a 1 billion shortterm revolving credit agreement expiring in june 2012 the purpose of which is to provide shortterm funds in the event access to commercial paper markets is not available the company expects to renew these facilities before their expiration for all or a portion of the available borrowings thereunder at december 31 2011 the company had 900 million of commercial paper indebtedness outstanding and accordingly the company had 100 million of borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program revolver

overview of results of operations and liquidity continued 

 

the company believes that its existing cash and shortterm investments of 102 billion as of december 31 2011 and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under both its principal and commercial paper revolving credit agreements and the expected renewals thereof are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories business combinations intangible assets and goodwill equity investments sales returns warranty obligations income taxes contingencies and litigation pension costs and stockbased compensation management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

 

a accounts receivable 

 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due such allowances totaled 67 million at december 31 2011 the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate reducing their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required 

 

b inventories 

 

the company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand additional writedowns may be required 

 

c intangible assets and goodwill 

 

the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible assets which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition definitelived intangible assets totaled 647 billion at december 31 2011 the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

 

 

financial statement index

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 1199 billion and 133 billion respectively at december 31 2011 estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

 

the company’s businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010 growth at some of the company’s businesses also slowed in 2011 which the company believes was in part due to uncertainty in funding expectations of customers in academic and government markets projections of profitability for 2012 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2011 the date of the company’s impairment testing there can be no assurance however that the slowing of growth experienced in 2011 at some businesses will not continue or worsen in 2012 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

 

d other longlived assets 

 

the company reviews other longlived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets other longlived assets totaled 221 billion at december 31 2011 including 166 billion of fixed assets in testing a longlived asset for impairment assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and assetrelated expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts charges for impairment of other longlived assets may be necessary 

 

e revenues 

 

in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change the company’s revenue recognition would be affected

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

 

in instances where the company sells equipment with customerspecified acceptance criteria the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition if the nature of customerspecified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 

 

the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” the company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered elements in the event vsoe is not available for any undelivered element revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than postcontract support is completed revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed based on vsoe which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately 

 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers should a greater or lesser number of products be returned additional adjustments to revenue may be required 

 

f warranty obligations 

 

at the time the company recognizes revenue it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns the liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled 42 million at december 31 2011 should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 

 

g income taxes 

 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company’s reserve for these matters totaled 120 million at december 31 2011 where applicable associated interest expense has also been recognized 

 

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 142 million at december 31 2011 should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

 

the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result 

 

h contingencies and litigation 

 

the company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental workers’ compensation product general and auto liabilities and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on management’s judgment historical claims experience the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates reserves of acquired businesses including environmental reserves were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value additionally the company records receivables from thirdparty insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

 

i pension and other retiree benefits 

 

several of the company’s us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with thirdparty actuaries and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled 17 million in 2011 the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled 346 million at yearend 2011 compared with 244 million at yearend 2010 should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation for example a 10 decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately 2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately 79 million 

 

the company expects to contribute between 20 and 30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012

   j stockbased compensation 

 

the fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model for option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions a lattice model is used to estimate fair value use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stockbased compensation the compensation expense recognized for all stockbased awards is net of estimated forfeitures the company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures if actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures adjustments to compensation expense may be required 

 

results of operations 

 

2011 compared with 2010 

 

continuing operations 

 

sales in 2011 were 1173 billion an increase of 116 billion from 2010 the increase was due to acquisitions including phadia and dionex and to a lesser extent higher revenues at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation had phadia dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010 pro forma revenues would have increased 787 million 7 over pro forma 2010 revenues including 132 million due to other acquisitions net of divestitures 266 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and 389 million 3 due to higher revenues at existing businesses the increase in pro forma revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand offset in part by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract discussed below and lower stimulusfunded sales in japan as compared to 2010 which together decreased sales by approximately 1 percentage point sales growth was strong in asia and modest in europe and north america the results in north america and asia were affected by the cessation of the supply contract and the lower stimulusfunded sales in japan respectively the company had lower sales to academic and government markets in the second half of 2011 which it believes may be due to uncertainty in funding expectations in the us and europe these markets represent approximately a quarter of the company’s revenues and the decrease in sales to this customer base reduced the company’s overall growth in the second half of 2011 by approximately one percentage point although the decline moderated in the fourth quarter the company currently expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue into 2012 

 

in 2011 operating income and operating income margin were 125 billion and 106 respectively compared with 121 billion and 114 respectively in 2010 the decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to 124 million of higher acquisitionrelated charges and an increase in amortization expense of 93 million in 2011 primarily related to the acquisitions of phadia and dionex the decrease in operating margin was offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses the company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi processes reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities

currency exchange rates 

 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro swedish krona british pounds sterling canadian dollars danish krone and swiss francs the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in yearend 2011 functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 761 million 

 

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2011 nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currencyexchange contracts of 30 million a 10 appreciation in yearend 2011 nonfunctional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 30 million the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

 

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2011 nonfunctional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of 10 million on the company’s net income

raw materials 

 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business rawmaterial and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials and the use of derivative instruments to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

 

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

patents are important in both segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

 

seasonal influences 

 

revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of flu season 

 

working capital requirements 

 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

 

dependency on a single customer 

 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 5 of our total revenues in any of the past three years 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2010 and 2009 was as follows 

 

 

we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2010 will be filled during 2011 

 

government contracts 

 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results

competition 

 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors in general competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 our rockford illinois facility is subject to a resource conservation and recovery act rcra corrective action program administered by the illinois environmental protection agency we are required to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 22 million at december 31 2010 the liability for environmental matters associated with fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value 

 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

regulatory affairs 

 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the food and drug administration and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

 item 1a risk factors 

 

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements beginning on page 3 

 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business

our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate the current economic conditions including the lingering effects of the global recession could adversely impact our business in 2011 and beyond resulting in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 

 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2010 currency translation had an unfavorable effect of 20 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

 

healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us the recently enacted federal legislation on healthcare reform could have an adverse impact on us some of the potential consequences such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services the new legislation also includes an excise tax beginning in 2013 on revenue from the sale by manufacturers of certain medical devices which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

 

if any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage the products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments businesses include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all

our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory including antitrust approvals we may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 927 billion and 133 billion respectively as of december 31 2010 we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

 

because we compete directly with certain of our largest customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory consumables business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability  we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as ups and federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if ups or another thirdparty packagedelivery provider experiences a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if ups or our other thirdparty packagedelivery providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected

we are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations including those regarding the manufacture of products the shipping of our products and environmental matters some of our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the us food and drug administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

 

we are subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern the handling transportation manufacture use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture sell or distribute this requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations including the establishment of reserves to address potential environmental costs and manage environmental risks 

 

we rely heavily on our manufacturing operations to produce products we sell and our business could be adversely affected by disruptions of our manufacturing operations we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins steel and serum while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems or system failures at certain of our sites could interfere with our operations as a part of the effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected

  we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to customers track customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results 

 

our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 214 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to borrow an additional 952 million under our revolving credit facility we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility include a debttoebitda ratio specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the facility the consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 30 to 10 

 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings including individual and consolidated multiparty product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured these matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business as well as through acquisitions we believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers management after review and consideration with counsel considers that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows while liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material we currently believe on the basis of our claims history and related factors that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable see “item 1 – business – environmental matters” for legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

reference is made throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page f1 of this report 

 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses the company’s continuing operations fall into two business segments analytical technologies and laboratory products and services revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of customers 

 

 

sales in 2010 were 1079 billion an increase of 679 million from 2009 aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions net of divestitures discussed in total and by segment below revenues increased from 2009 revenues by 433 million 4 due to increased demand and to a lesser extent higher stimulusfunded spending by customers and price increases sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand the increase in revenues was offset by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season than in 2009 as discussed below these factors decreased sales by approximately 2 percentage points the company estimates that stimulusfunded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010 primarily in the first quarter 

 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2010 and 2009 the company’s principal acquisitions are described below

on december 13 2010 the company and dionex corporation a leading manufacturer and marketer of chromatography systems announced that their boards of directors unanimously approved a transaction under which thermo fisher will acquire all of the outstanding shares of dionex for 11850 per share in cash or a total purchase price of approximately 21 billion dionex headquartered in sunnyvale california is a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems consumables and software for chemical analysis dionex systems are used worldwide in environmental analysis and by the life sciences chemical petrochemical food and beverage power generation and electronics industries their expertise in applications and instrumentation helps analytical scientists to evaluate and develop pharmaceuticals establish environmental regulations and produce better industrial products the transaction is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals 

 

in 2010 operating income and operating income margin were 126 billion and 117 respectively compared with 105 billion and 104 respectively in 2009 the increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and to a lesser extent productivity improvements global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions in addition amortization expense decreased by 25 million in 2010 primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles from a 2005 acquisition 

 

the company’s effective tax rates were 113 and 82 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions the tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by 174 million or 15 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates the company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 155 and 175 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business the tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by 55 million or 06 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates 

 

income from continuing operations increased to 103 billion in 2010 from 851 million in 2009 primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income offset in part by a higher tax rate 

 

during 2010 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 150 billion compared with 166 billion for 2009 the decrease resulted primarily from increases in working capital items particularly accounts receivable and inventories to support the growth in sales 

 

as of december 31 2010 the company’s outstanding debt totaled 214 billion of which approximately 033 billion is convertible debt at a conversion price of 4020 per share upon an investor’s election to convert the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock at the companys election for any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted march 2011 the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of 100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet the facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of 952 million at december 31 2010 

 

in december 2010 the company obtained shortterm financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund 15 billion of the purchase price of dionex however in february 2011 the company issued 22 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 – 10 years primarily to fund the purchase of dionex and subsequently terminated the shortterm financing commitment if the company does not consummate the dionex acquisition by september 30 2011 the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101 of the aggregate principal plus accrued and unpaid interest

the company believes that its existing cash and shortterm investments of 926 million as of december 31 2010 and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories business combinations intangible assets and goodwill equity investments sales returns warranty obligations income taxes contingencies and litigation pension costs and stockbased compensation management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

 

a accounts receivable 

 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due such allowances totaled 40 million at december 31 2010 the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate reducing their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required 

 

b inventories 

 

the company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand additional writedowns may be required 

 

c intangible assets and goodwill 

 

the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining i fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition amortizable intangible assets totaled 471 billion at december 31 2010 the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

 

 

financial statement index 

  

  

 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

 

 

 

 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 927 billion and 133 billion respectively at december 31 2010 estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

 

the company’s businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010 projections of profitability for 2011 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at december 31 2010 there can be no assurance however that an economic recovery will continue into 2011 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

 

d other longlived assets 

 

the company reviews other longlived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets other longlived assets totaled 190 billion at december 31 2010 including 141 billion of fixed assets in testing a longlived asset for impairment assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and assetrelated expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts charges for impairment of other longlived assets may be necessary 

 

e revenues 

 

in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change the company’s revenue recognition would be affected 

 

 

financial statement index 

  

  

 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

 

 

 

in instances where the company sells equipment with customerspecified acceptance criteria the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition if the nature of customerspecified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 

 

the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” the company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered elements in the event vsoe is not available for any undelivered element revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed based on vsoe which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately 

 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers should a greater or lesser number of products be returned additional adjustments to revenue may be required 

 

f warranty obligations 

 

at the time the company recognizes revenue it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns the liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled 42 million at december 31 2010 should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 

 

g income taxes 

 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company’s reserve for these matters totaled 62 million at december 31 2010 where applicable associated interest expense has also been recognized 

 

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income 

 

 

financial statement index 

  

  

 

thermo fisher scientific inc 

 

 

 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 156 million at december 31 2010 should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

 

the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates accrued income taxes totaled 59 million at december 31 2010 should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result 

 

h contingencies and litigation

i pension and other retiree benefits 

 

several of the company’s us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with thirdparty actuaries and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled 14 million in 2010 the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled 244 million at yearend 2010 compared with 225 million at yearend 2009 should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation for example a 10 decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately 4 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately 84 million 

 

the company expects to contribute between 20 and 30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2010 the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings the fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2010 was 229 billion fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity if interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s debt at december 31 2010 would increase by approximately 77 million 

 

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments including swap arrangements a 100basispoint increase in interest rates at december 31 2010 would increase the company’s annual pretax interest expense by approximately 12 million 

 

currency exchange rates 

 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros british pounds sterling canadian dollars swedish kronor and swiss francs the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in yearend 2010 functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 441 million

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

patents are important in both segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

 

seasonal influences 

 

revenues in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in the other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of flu season 

 

working capital requirements 

 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

 

dependency on a single customer 

 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in any of the past three years

government contracts 

 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

 

competition 

 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors in general competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures

  our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 our rockford illinois facility is subject to a resource conservation and recovery act rcra corrective action program administered by the illinois environmental protection agency we are required to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site 

 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 23 million at december 31 2009 the liability for environmental matters associated with fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value 

 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

regulatory affairs 

 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the food and drug administration and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements beginning on page 3 

 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business 

 

our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate the current economic conditions including the global recession could adversely impact our business in 2010 and beyond resulting in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

development of our products requires significant investment our products and technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels these activities require us to make significant investments 

 

products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can the products that we are currently developing or those we will develop in the future may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete 

 

demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets in 2009 our international revenues from continuing operations including export revenues from the united states accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenues the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2009 currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of 211 million due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

 

healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us the us congress is debating healthcare reform that could have an adverse impact on us some of the potential changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services changes in tax laws relating to healthcare reform such as the proposal in the bill approved by the house of representatives that would assess an annual tax on revenue from the sale of medical devices would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

 

if any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage the products sold by our environmental instruments business include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the product undetected which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

 

our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory including antitrust approvals we may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 898 billion and 133 billion respectively as of december 31 2009 we assess the realizability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets

  our growth strategy to acquire new businesses may not be successful and the integration of future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive to our ongoing operations 

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

 

because we compete directly with certain of our largest customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us our largest customer in the laboratory consumables business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability  we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as ups and federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if ups or another thirdparty packagedelivery provider experiences a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if ups or our other thirdparty packagedelivery providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations including those regarding the manufacture of products the shipping of our products and environmental matters some of our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the us food and drug administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

 

we are subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern the handling transportation manufacture use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture sell or distribute this requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations including the establishment of reserves to address potential environmental costs and manage environmental risks

we rely heavily on manufacturing operations to produce the products we sell and our business could be adversely affected by disruptions of our manufacturing operation we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins steel and serum while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems or system failures at certain of our sites could interfere with our operations as a part of the effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

 

we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with suppliers sell our products and services fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events when we upgrade or change systems we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality certain of our systems are not redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our services which could harm our reputation and financial results

our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 218 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to borrow an additional 946 million under our revolving credit facility we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility include a debttoebitda ratio specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the facility the consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 30 to 10 

 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings including individual and consolidated multiparty product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured these matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business as well as through acquisitions we believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers management after review and consideration with counsel considers that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows while liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material we currently believe on the basis of our claims history and related factors that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable see “item 1 – business – environmental matters” for legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters 

 

we are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including among others the us food and drug administration and the agency for international development various governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine matters relating to our operations some operations involve and have involved the handling manufacture use or sale of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws consequently some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and we cannot assure that material damage will not occur or be discovered or that the damage will not be determined to be material in the future

  reference is made throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page f1 of this report 

 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses the company’s continuing operations fall into two business segments analytical technologies and laboratory products and services during each of the first quarters of 2009 and 2008 the company transferred management responsibility and related financial reporting and monitoring for a small product line between segments the company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect these transfers revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers 

 

 

sales in 2009 were 1011 billion a decrease of 388 million from 2008 aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions net of divestitures discussed in total and by segment below revenues decreased from 2008 revenues by 342 million 3 due to lower revenues at existing businesses as a result of decreased demand offset in part by price increases sales of equipment and to a lesser extent services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn sales of consumables grew modestly however and were not as significantly affected by the severe economic conditions 

 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2009 and 2008 the principal acquisitions in 2009 were biolab an australiabased provider of analytical instruments life science consumables and laboratory equipment in april 2009 and brahms ag a leading provider of specialty diagnostic tests based on patented biomarkers for sepsis cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as well as intensive care treatments and prenatal screening in october 2009 biolab broadened the geographic reach of the company’s customer channels brahms increased the breadth of the company’s specialty diagnostics portfolio and provided a significant reagent manufacturing center in europe 

 

in 2009 operating income and operating income margin were 105 billion and 104 respectively compared with 123 billion and 117 respectively in 2008 the decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives in addition restructuring and other costs increased 32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and to a lesser extent increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – overview of results of operations and liquidity continued 

the company’s effective tax rates were 82 and 135 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions the tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by 55 million or 06 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of newly enacted tax rates the company expects its effective tax rate in 2010 will be between 17 and 19 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business the tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by 28 million or 25 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in switzerland

 

income from continuing operations decreased to 851 million in 2009 from 975 million in 2008 primarily due to the items discussed above that decreased operating income offset in part by a lower tax rate 

 

during 2009 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 166 billion compared with 142 billion for 2008 the increase resulted primarily from decreased investment in working capital items particularly accounts receivable and inventories 

 

as of december 31 2009 the company’s outstanding debt totaled 218 billion of which approximately 066 billion is convertible debt at conversion prices ranging from 2373 to 4020 per share as of december 31 2009 340 million of the convertible debt was currently convertible during 2009 and early 2010 holders of debentures totaling 68 million in par value exercised conversion rights upon an investor’s election to convert the company is required to pay the original principal portion of these debentures in cash and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock at the companys election for any holders electing to convert in 2010 the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of 113 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet the facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of 946 million at december 31 2009 

 

the company believes that its existing cash and shortterm investments of 157 billion as of december 31 2009 and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to equity investments bad debts sales returns inventories business combinations intangible assets and goodwill warranty obligations income taxes pension costs contingencies and litigation stockbased compensation restructuring and sale of businesses management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

 

the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 

 

a accounts receivable 

 

the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due such allowances totaled 47 million at december 31 2009 the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate reducing their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required 

 

b inventories 

 

the company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand additional writedowns may be required 

 

c intangible assets and goodwill 

 

the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining i fair value and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or nonamortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition amortizable intangible assets totaled 501 billion at december 31 2009 the company reviews definitelived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

 

the company evaluates goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 898 billion and 133 billion respectively at december 31 2009 estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

 

the company’s businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn although results progressively improved during the year projections of profitability for 2010 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets existed at december 31 2009 there can be no assurance however that indicators of economic recovery will continue into 2010 and that a prolonged downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or other indicators of impairment or as a result of changes in the discount rate charges for impairment may be necessary 

 

d other longlived assets 

 

the company reviews other longlived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets other longlived assets totaled 177 billion at december 31 2009 including 133 billion of fixed assets in testing a longlived asset for impairment assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and assetrelated expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts charges for impairment of other longlived assets may be necessary 

 

e revenues 

 

in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change the company’s revenue recognition would be affected if fair value is not available for any undelivered element revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed 

 

in instances where the company sells equipment with customerspecified acceptance criteria the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition if the nature of customerspecified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 

 

the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements” the company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered elements in the event vsoe is not available for any undelivered element revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed based on vsoe which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately 

  

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers should a greater or lesser number of products be returned additional adjustments to revenue may be required

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

 

f warranty obligations 

 

at the time the company recognizes revenue it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns the liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled 45 million at december 31 2009 should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 

 

g income taxes 

 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements where applicable associated interest expense has also been recognized 

 

the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and nonus tax authorities as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income 

 

the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company reverses the related valuation allowance any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision the company’s tax valuation allowance totaled 1648 million at december 31 2009 should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 

 

the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates accrued income taxes totaled 28 million at december 31 2009 should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result

h contingencies and litigation 

 

the company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental workers’ compensation product general and auto liabilities and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on management’s judgment historical claims experience the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates reserves of acquired businesses including environmental reserves were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value additionally the company records receivables from thirdparty insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

 

i pension and other retiree benefits 

 

several of the company’s us and nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with thirdparty actuaries and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled 16 million in 2009 the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled 225 million at yearend 2009 compared with 303 million at yearend 2008 should any of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation for example a 10 decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately 2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately 85 million 

 

the company expects to contribute between 20 and 30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2010 

 

j stockbased compensation 

 

the fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model for option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions a lattice model is used to estimate fair value use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected lives of option grants through 2007 were estimated using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” options thereafter historical data on exercise patterns became the basis for determining the expected life of an option the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stockbased compensation the compensation expense recognized for all stockbased awards is net of estimated forfeitures the company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures if actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures adjustments to compensation expense may be required

l assets held for sale

continuing operations 

 

sales in 2009 were 1011 billion a decrease of 388 million from 2008 the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of 211 million in 2009 sales increased 165 million due to acquisitions net of divestitures aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions net of divestitures revenues decreased 342 million 3 primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases as described by segment below sales of equipment and to a lesser extent services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn sales of consumables grew modestly however and were not as significantly affected by the severe economic conditions sales were down in north america and europe but grew modestly in asia 

 

in the latter part of 2009 the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

in 2009 operating income and operating income margin were 105 billion and 104 respectively compared with 123 billion and 117 respectively in 2008 the decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives in addition restructuring and other costs increased 32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and to a lesser extent increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn

as of february 26 2010 the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately 38 million in 2010 and expects to identify additional actions during 2010 the restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 107 million including 59 million for actions taken through the end of 2009 and 48 million for actions that have been approved and will be completed in 2010 of the 107 million of total savings 63 million is in the analytical technologies segment and 44 million is in the laboratory products and services segment the restructuring actions initiated in 2008 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2008 and early 2009 of approximately 34 million including 26 million in the analytical technologies segment and 8 million in the laboratory products and services segment 

 

the companys revenues and profitability decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 although results progressively improved during 2009 the company believes the decreases were primarily due to the global economic downturn there can be no assurance that indicators of economic recovery will continue into 2010 and that a prolonged downturn will not affect the companys projections of profitability for 2010 and future years if actual results decrease materially from projected results impairment of goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets could occur these assets totaled 898 billion and 634 billion respectively at december 31 2009

laboratory products and services 

 

 

sales in the laboratory products and services segment decreased 29 million to 643 billion in 2009 the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of 128 million in 2009 sales increased 121 million due to acquisitions net of divestitures in addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions net of divestitures revenues decreased 22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below offset in part by increased prices demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn however this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the company’s research market and healthcare market channels 

 

in july 2008 the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010 under the revised agreement the company’s revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased 61 million in 2009 to 205 million in november 2009 the supplier notified the company that it intended to cease the current arrangement the company believes this was in part a response to the company’s strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions as a result of the supplier terminating this agreement the company expects sales of related products to be approximately 75 million in 2010 and none thereafter the company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and expects to sell approximately 40 million of these and other products from the new supplier in 2010 offsetting a portion of the anticipated drop in revenue

provision for income taxes 

 

the company’s effective tax rates were 82 and 135 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions the tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by 55 million or 06 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of newly enacted tax rates the company expects its effective tax rate in 2010 will be between 17 and 19 based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business the tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by 28 million or 25 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in switzerland

new products and research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments we are not currently committed to any new products that require the investment of a material amount of our funds nor do we have any definitive plans to enter new businesses that would require such an investment 

during 2008 2007 and 2006 we spent 249 million 239 million and 170 million respectively on research and development excluding a charge in 2008 of 3 million for inprocess research and development related to an acquisition and a charge in 2006 of 15 million for inprocess research and development at the date of the merger with fisher 

raw materials 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business rawmaterial and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials and the use of derivative instruments to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in both segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in the other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers 

working capital requirements 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

dependency on a single customer 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in any of the past three years

backlog 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2008 and 2007 was as follows 

 

we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2008 will be filled during 2009 

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

competition 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors in general competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

financial statement index 

  

  

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 our rockford illinois facility is subject to a resource conservation and recovery act rcra corrective action program administered by the illinois environmental protection agency we are required to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site this site was listed in 1983 on the national priority list under cercla both new jersey sites are also the subjects of cercla national resources damages claims 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 20 million at december 31 2008 and were not material prior to the merger with fisher the liability for environmental matters associated with fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

risk factors 

tableend 

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements beginning on page 3 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

financial statement index 

  

  

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business 

our business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate the current economic conditions including the credit crisis affecting the financial markets and the global recession could adversely impact our business in 2009 and beyond resulting in 

 

 

 

 

 

development of our products requires significant investment our products and technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels these activities require us to make significant investments 

financial statement index 

  

  

products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can the products that we are currently developing or those we will develop in the future may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete 

demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets in 2008 our international revenues from continuing operations including export revenues from the united states accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenues the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2008 currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of 113 million due to a weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services but based on rates in effect in early 2009 the impact of currency translation will be unfavorable in 2009 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

financial statement index 

  

  

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights for example in september 2004 applied biosystemsmds scientific instruments and related parties brought a lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held by the plaintiffs we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

if any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage the products sold by our environmental instruments business include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the product undetected which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory including antitrust approvals we may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

financial statement index 

  

  

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 868 and 133 billion respectively as of december 31 2008 we assess the realizability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our growth strategy to acquire new businesses may not be successful and the integration of future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive to our ongoing operations 

we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold from 1997 through 2004 we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of 2 billion as part of these transactions we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses such as lawsuits product liability and environmental claims and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

because we compete directly with certain of our largest customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us 

our largest customer   in the laboratory consumables business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability  

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as ups and federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if ups or another thirdparty packagedelivery provider experiences a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if ups or our other thirdparty packagedelivery providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

financial statement index 

  

  

we are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations including those regarding the manufacture of products the shipping of our products and environmental matters 

some of our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the us food and drug administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

we are subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern the handling transportation manufacture use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture sell or distribute this requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations including the establishment of reserves to address potential environmental costs and manage environmental risks 

we rely heavily on manufacturing operations to produce the products we sell and our business could be adversely affected by disruptions of our manufacturing operations 

we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be unable to adjust to rapid changes in the healthcare industry some of which could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs these changes include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our business  results of operations   and cash flows 

 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

 

  we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins steel and serum while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems at certain of our sites could interfere with our operations as a part of the effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes take customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 206 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to incur an additional 950 million of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility include a debttoebitda ratio specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the facility the consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 30 to 10 

 

financial statement index 

  

  

 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments   would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings including consolidated multiparty product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured these matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business as well as through acquisitions we believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers management after review and consideration with counsel considers that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows while liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material we currently believe on the basis of our claims history and related factors that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable see “item 1 — business — environmental matters” for legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters 

we are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including among others the us food and drug administration and the agency for international development various governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine matters relating to our operations some operations involve and have involved the handling manufacture use or sale of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws consequently some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and we cannot assure that material damage will not occur or be discovered or that the damage will not be determined to be material in the future

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

reference is made throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page f1 of this report 

thermo electron corporation and fisher scientific international inc completed a merger of the two companies on november 9 2006 in a taxfree stockforstock exchange the fisher businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical laboratories the fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals cellculture media and proprietary rnai technology to rapiddiagnostic tests safety products and other consumable supplies fisher had revenues of 54 billion in 2005 fisher’s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from november 9 2006 following the merger the company was renamed thermo fisher scientific inc to assist in year over year comparisons certain information in the following discussion of the company’s results of operations has been presented on a pro forma basis as if the two companies had been combined from the beginning of 2006 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses following the merger with fisher the company’s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments analytical technologies and laboratory products and services during the first quarter of 2008 the company transferred management responsibility and related financial reporting and monitoring for several small product lines between segments the company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect these transfers revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers 

 

sales in 2008 were 1050 billion an increase of 752 million from 2007 aside from the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation discussed in total and by segment below revenues increased over 2007 revenues by 453 million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand discussed below and to a lesser extent price increases

in 2008 operating income and operating income margin were 123 billion and 117 respectively compared with 974 million and 100 respectively in 2007 the increase in operating income was due to higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues including price increases merger integration savings and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions the increase also resulted from 48 million of lower cost of revenues charges primarily mergerrelated and from 7 million of lower restructuring and other costs in 2008 principally due to a curtailment gain in 2008 associated with a pension plan in the us these increases were offset in part by a 32 million increase in amortization expense as a result of acquisitionrelated intangible assets from 2007 and 2008 acquisitions 

the company’s effective tax rate was 140 and 115 in 2008 and 2007 respectively the tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by 28 million or 24 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state tax rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in switzerland aside from the impact of these items the tax rate was unfavorably affected by an increase in income in higher tax jurisdictions the tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by 32 million or 36 percentage points resulting from enacted reductions in tax rates in the united kingdom denmark canada and germany on the company’s deferred tax balances 

income from continuing operations increased to 989 million in 2008 from 780 million in 2007 primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income in 2008 offset in part by the higher tax rate in 2008 

during 2008 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 142 billion compared with 148 billion for 2007 the decrease resulted from higher payments for income taxes and an increased investment in working capital items offset in part by improved cash flow at existing businesses cash flow from operations in 2007 was net of 78 million in mergerrelated operating cash outflows including severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by fisher that were paid subsequent to 2006 

as of december 31 2008 the company’s outstanding debt totaled 206 billion of which approximately 969 million is convertible debt at conversion prices ranging from 2373 to 4020 per share as of february 27 2009 295 million of the convertible debt was currently convertible although the company’s experience is that convertible debentures are not normally converted by investors until close to their maturity date it is possible particularly in the current uncertain financial climate that debentures could be converted prior to their maturity date if for example a holder perceives the market for the debentures to be weaker than the market for the common stock upon an investor’s election to convert the company is required to pay the original principal portion of these debentures in cash and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock at the companys election should holders elect to convert or exercise their put rights the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund substantially all of these principal payments the facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of 950 million at december 31 2008 

the company believes that its existing cash and shortterm investments of 129 billion as of december 31 2008 and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months

income taxes pension costs contingencies and litigation stockbased compensation restructuring and sale of businesses management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

in the latter part of 2008 the us dollar strengthened against other major currencies in which the company sells product and services strengthening of the dollar had a negative effect on the amount of revenues the company reported in us dollars of approximately 4 in the fourth quarter of 2008 were the currency exchange rates in effect in early 2009 to remain during 2009 translation would negatively affect revenues in 2009 by approximately 4 the lower revenues would unfavorably affect earnings per share by approximately 15

segment results 

 

the company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues principally associated with acquisition accounting restructuring and other costsincome including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and charges for the acceleration of stockbased compensation following the merger with fisher the company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation note 3 

income from the company’s reportable segments increased 14 to 187 billion in 2008 due primarily to higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues including price increases and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions this improvement was offset in part by higher commodity prices

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and equity prices which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities additionally the company uses shortterm forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies the company enters into forward currencyexchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ local currencies the company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities however the purpose of the company’s currency hedging activities is to protect the company’s local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company’s forward currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euros us dollars british pounds sterling canadian dollars danish krone and australian dollars income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the company does not enter into speculative currency agreements 

interest rates 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2008 the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings the fair market value of the company’s longterm fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the total estimated fair value of the company’s longterm debt at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 was 2131 billion and 3004 billion respectively fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity if interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of the company’s longterm debt at december 31 2008 would increase by approximately 52 million in 2007 a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the company’s debt by approximately 61 million 

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments a 100basispoint increase in 90day libor at december 31 2008 and 2007 would increase the company’s annual pretax interest expense by 34 million and 47 million respectively 

currency exchange rates 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros british pounds sterling and japanese yen the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in yearend 2008 and 2007 functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 306 million and 297 million respectively 

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 appreciation in yearend 2008 and 2007 currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 24 million and 22 million respectively the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

financial statement index 

  

  

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2008 and 2007 currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of 8 million and 26 million respectively on the company’s net income 

equity prices 

the company’s availableforsale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price in addition the company’s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s availableforsale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument a 10 increase in yearend 2008 and 2007 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations by 81 million and 180 million respectively

financial statement index 

during 2007 2006 and 2005 we spent 239 million 170 million and 153 million respectively on research and development excluding a charge in 2006 of 15 million for inprocess research and development at the date of the merger with fisher 

raw materials 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business rawmaterial and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials and the use of derivative instruments to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in both segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in the other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers 

working capital requirements 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

dependency on a single customer 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in any of the past three years 

backlog 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2007 and 2006 was as follows 

 

we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2007 will be filled during 2008 the increase in backlog in 2007 is principally due to increased demand 

financial statement index 

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

competition 

general 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors in general competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency epa osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

financial statement index 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 our rockford illinois facility is subject to a resource conservation and recovery act rcra corrective action program administered by the illinois environmental protection agency we are required to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site this site was listed in 1983 on the national priority list under cercla both new jersey sites are also the subjects of cercla national resources damages claims 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 23 million at december 31 2007 and were not material prior to the merger with fisher the liability for environmental matters associated with fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulatory affairs 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the food and drug administration and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

risk factors 

tableend 

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements beginning on page 3 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

development of our products requires significant investment our products and technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels these activities require us to make significant investments 

financial statement index 

risk factors continued 

products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can the products that we are currently developing or those we will develop in the future may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business 

the company may be unable to integrate successfully the legacy businesses of thermo electron corporation and fisher scientific international inc and may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the merger involved the combination of two companies which previously operated as independent public companies the company is required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations potential difficulties the company may encounter in the integration process include the following

risk factors continued 

 

 

 

in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption or interruption of or the loss of momentum in the company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the company 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights for example in september 2004 applied biosystemsmds scientific instruments and related parties brought a lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held by the plaintiffs we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

financial statement index 

risk factors continued 

demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 

our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future benefits from new productivity initiatives we continue to pursue practical process improvement ppi programs and other cost saving initiatives at our locations which are designed to further enhance our productivity efficiency and customer satisfaction while we anticipate continued benefits from these initiatives future benefits are expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve 

our business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our business in 2008 and beyond resulting in 

 

 

 

 

 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

if any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage the products sold by our environmental instruments business include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the product undetected which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services promising acquisitions 

financial statement index 

risk factors continued 

are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory including antitrust approvals we may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet which amount to approximately 871 billion and 133 billion respectively as of december 31 2007 we assess the realizability of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our growth strategy to acquire new businesses may not be successful and the integration of future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive to our ongoing operations 

we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold from 1997 through 2004 we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of 2 billion as part of these transactions we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses such as lawsuits product liability and environmental claims and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets in 2007 our international revenues from continuing operations including export revenues from the united states accounted for approximately 35 of our total revenues the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2007 currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of 241 million due to a weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing 

financial statement index 

risk factors continued 

private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

because we compete directly with certain of our largest customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us 

our largest customer   in the laboratory consumables business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability  

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as ups and federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if ups or another thirdparty packagedelivery provider experiences a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if ups or our other thirdparty packagedelivery providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

we are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations including those regarding the manufacture of products the shipping of our products and environmental matters 

some of our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the us food and drug administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

we are subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern the handling transportation manufacture use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture sell or distribute this requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations including the establishment of reserves to address potential environmental costs and manage environmental risks 

we rely heavily on manufacturing operations to produce the products we sell and our business could be adversely affected by disruptions of our manufacturing operations 

financial statement index 

risk factors continued 

we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be unable to adjust to rapid changes in the healthcare industry some of which could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs these changes include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins steel and serum while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems at certain of our sites could interfere with our operations as a part of the effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes take customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

financial statement index 

risk factors continued 

our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 220 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to incur an additional 955 million of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility include a debttoebitda ratio specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the facility the consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 30 to 10 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments   would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

on september 3 2004 applera corporation mds inc and applied biosystemsmds scientific instruments filed a complaint against the company in us district court for the district of delaware civil action no 041230gms these plaintiffs allege that the company’s mass spectrometer systems including its triple quadrupole and certain of its ion trap systems infringe us patent number 4963736 entitled “mass spectrometer and method and improved ion transmission” the plaintiffs seek damages including treble damages for alleged willful infringement attorneys’ fees prejudgment interest and injunctive relief an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings including consolidated multiparty product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured these matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business as well as through acquisitions we believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers management after review and consideration with counsel considers that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows while liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material we currently believe on the basis of our claims history and related factors that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable see “item 1 — business — environmental matters” for legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters 

we are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including among others the us food and drug administration and the agency for international development various governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine matters relating to our operations some operations involve and have involved the handling

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

reference is made throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page f1 of this report 

thermo electron corporation and fisher scientific international inc completed a merger of the two companies on november 9 2006 in a taxfree stockforstock exchange the fisher businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical laboratories the fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals cellculture media and proprietary rnai technology to rapiddiagnostic tests safety products and other consumable supplies fisher had revenues of 54 billion in 2005 fisher’s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from november 9 2006 following the merger the company was renamed thermo fisher scientific inc to assist in year over year comparisons certain information in the following discussion of the company’s results of operations has been presented on a pro forma basis as if the two companies had been combined from the beginning of 2006 

overview of results of operations and liquidity 

the company develops manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses following the merger with fisher the company’s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments analytical technologies and laboratory products and services revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other q uarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers 

financial statement index 

 

 

  sales in 2007 were 975 billion an increase of 595 billion from 2006 sales increased principally due to the merger with fisher as well as other acquisitions and to a lesser extent increased demand and the favorable effect of currency translation if the merger with fisher had occurred on january 1 2006 revenues would have increased 876 million 10 over pro forma 2006 revenues aside from the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made by both companies and currency translation discussed in total and by segment below revenues increased over pro forma 2006 revenues by 507 million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand discussed below and to a lesser extent price increases 

 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2007 and 2006 in addition to the merger with fisher the principal acquisitions included laphapack a manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and related accessories in december 2007 priority solutions international a thirdparty provider to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in october 2007 nanodrop technologies inc a supplier of uvvis spectrophotometry and fluorescence scientific instruments in october 2007 qualigens fine chemicals a chemical manufacturer and supplier in september 2007 and cohesive technologies inc a provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid chromatography products in december 2006 

in 2007 the company’s operating income and operating income margin were 974 million and 100 respectively compared with 242 million and 64 respectively in 2006 operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues the increase in operating income was due to the fisher merger and to a lesser extent higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues price increases and productivity improvements and 125 million of pretax charges in 2006 associated with the fisher merger described below these increases were offset in part by 400 million of higher amortization expense as a result of acquisitionrelated intangible assets from the fisher merger and other acquisitions 

the company’s effective tax rate was 115 and 206 in 2007 and 2006 respectively the tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by a onetime benefit of enacted reductions in tax rates in the united kingdom denmark canada and germany on the company’s deferred tax balances this benefit totaled 32 million in addition to the impact of this item the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits in particular lower income in the united states due to charges and amortization associated with the fisher merger together with the impact of an increased us tax credit for foreign taxes an enhanced tax credit for qualifying us research costs and growth in lower tax regions such as asia 

income from continuing operations increased to 780 million in 2007 from 166 million in 2006 primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income in 2007 and the onetime tax benefit discussed above offset in part by higher interest expense primarily associated with debt assumed in the fisher merger 

during 2007 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 148 billion compared with 406 million for 2006 the increase resulted from cash flow from the fisher businesses and to a lesser extent improved cash flow at existing businesses cash flow from operations in 2007 and 2006 were net of 78 million and 157 million respectively in mergerrelated operating cash outflows including severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by fisher that were paid subsequent to november 9 2006 

financial statement index 

as of december 31 2007 the company’s outstanding debt totaled 220 billion of which 93 is due in 2010 and thereafter the company expects that its existing cash and shortterm investments of 639 million as of december 31 2007 and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowing capacity of up to 955 million under its existing 5year revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to equity investments bad debts sales returns inventories business combinations intangible assets warranty obligations income taxes pension costs contingencies and litigation stockbased compensation restructuring and sale of businesses the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

interest rates 

certain of the company’s shortterm availableforsale investments and longterm obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument a 10 decrease in yearend 2007 and 2006 market interest rates would result in a net negative impact to the company of 181 million and 84 million respectively on the net fair value of its interestsensitive financial instruments 

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments a 100basispoint increase in 90day libor at december 31 2007 and 2006 would increase the company’s annual pretax interest expense by 47 million and 9 million respectively

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros british pounds sterling and japanese yen the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in yearend 2007 and 2006 functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 297 million and 324 million respectively 

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 appreciation in yearend 2007 and 2006 currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 22 million and 7 million respectively the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 

certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related yearend 2007 and 2006 currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of 26 million and 5 million respectively on the company’s net income

new products and research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments we are not currently committed to any new products that require the investment of a material amount of our funds nor do we have any definitive plans to enter new businesses that would require such an investment 

financial statement index 

 

during 2006 2005 and 2004 we spent 170 million 153 million and 135 million respectively on research and development excluding a charge in 2006 of 15 million for inprocess research and development at the date of the merger with fisher 

raw materials 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business rawmaterial and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions we employ many strategies including the use of alternative materials and the use of derivative instruments to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in both segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in the other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers 

working capital requirements 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

dependency on a single customer 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in any of the past three years 

backlog 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2006 and 2005 was as follows 

 

we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2006 will be filled during 2007 the increase in backlog in 2006 is principally due to the fisher merger and to a lesser extent increased demand 

financial statement index 

 

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

competition 

general 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and thirdparty distributors in general competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries us federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration “osha” concerning employee safety and health matters the united states environmental protection agency “epa” osha and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations 

    in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements 

a number of our operations involve the handling manufacturing use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws consequently some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

financial statement index 

 

our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters based on current information we believe that these compliance costs are not material for historical remediation obligations our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting installing and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures we estimate our aggregate expenses for these environmental remediation matters will be approximately 1 million per year 

our fair lawn and somerville new jersey facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the new jersey department of environmental protection in 1984 our rockford illinois facility is subject to a resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” corrective action program administered by the illinois environmental protection agency we are required to maintain groundwaterremediation activities at these sites as the owner of the fair lawn facility we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the fair lawn wellfields superfund site this site was listed in 1983 on the national priority list under cercla both new jersey sites are also the subjects of cercla national resources damages claims 

we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated we calculate estimates based upon several factors including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management’s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters we include in these estimates potential costs for investigation remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled 24 million at december 31 2006 and were not material prior to the merger with fisher the liability for environmental matters associated with fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value 

these environmental liabilities do not include thirdparty recoveries to which we may be entitled we believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur as a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and the effect of changes in accounting rules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulatory affairs 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the united states drug enforcement administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the food and drug administration and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies as thermo fisher’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury in addition our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the department of transportation the federal aviation administration and similar foreign agencies while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations 

number of employees 

as of december 31  2006 we had approximately 30500 employees

in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption or interruption of or the loss of momentum in the company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the company 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights for example in september 2004 applied biosystemsmds scientific instruments and related parties brought a lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held by the plaintiffs we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products

our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future benefits from new productivity initiatives we continue to pursue practical process improvement ppi programs and other cost saving initiatives at our locations which are designed to further enhance our productivity efficiency and customer satisfaction while we anticipate continued benefits from these initiatives future benefits are expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve 

our business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our business in 2007 and beyond resulting in 

·   reduced demand for some of our products 

·   increased rate of order cancellations or delays 

·   increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

·   increased pressure on the prices for our products and services and 

·   greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

if any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage the products sold by our environmental instruments business include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the product undetected which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory including antitrust approvals we may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet which amounts to approximately 85 billion as of december 31 2006 we assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our growth strategy to acquire new businesses may not be successful and the integration of future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive to our ongoing operations 

 

we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold from 1997 through 2004 we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of 2 billion as part of these transactions we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses such as lawsuits product liability and environmental claims and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets in 2006 our international revenues from continuing operations including export revenues from the united states accounted for approximately 46 of our total revenues the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2006 currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of 18 million due to a weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

because we compete directly with certain of our largest customers and product suppliers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us 

financial statement index 

 

our largest customer   in the laboratory consumables business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us in addition we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from thirdparty suppliers we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large thirdparty suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability  

 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as ups and federal express in the us and dhl in europe we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers including national and regional trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if ups or another thirdparty packagedelivery provider experiences a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if ups or our other thirdparty packagedelivery providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected 

we are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations including those regarding the manufacture of products the shipping of our products and environmental matters 

some of our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the us food and drug administration’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues 

we are subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern the handling transportation manufacture use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture sell or distribute this requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations including the establishment of reserves to address potential environmental costs and manage environmental risks 

we rely heavily on manufacturing operations to produce the products we sell and our business could be adversely affected by disruptions of our manufacturing operations 

we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire earthquakes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

we may be unable to adjust to rapid changes in the healthcare industry some of which could adversely affect our business 

the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs these changes include 

          

        •   development of large and sophisticated groups purchasing medical and surgical supplies 

      

      •   wider implementation of managed care 

      

      •   legislative healthcare reform 

      •   consolidation of pharmaceutical companies 

      

      •   increased outsourcing of certain activities including to lowcost offshore locations and 

      

      •   consolidation of distributors of pharmaceutical medical and surgical supplies 

we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcareindustry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services 

we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices which could reduce our earnings and cash flow 

our primary commodity exposures are for fuel petroleumbased resins steel and serum while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various costsaving measures our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could interfere with our operations as a part of the effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes take customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 27 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had the ability to incur an additional 635 million of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

financial statement index 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our revolving credit facility include a debttoebitda ratio specifically the company has agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the new facility it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the new facility the consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 30 to 10 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments   would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments

legal proceedings 

tableend 

on september 3 2004 applera corporation mds inc and applied biosystemsmds scientific instruments filed a complaint against the company in us district court for the district of delaware civil action no 041230gms these plaintiffs allege that the company’s mass spectrometer systems including its triple quadrupole and certain of its ion trap systems infringe us patent number 4963736 entitled “mass spectrometer and method and improved ion transmission” the plaintiffs seek damages including treble damages for alleged willful infringement attorneys’ fees prejudgment interest and injunctive relief an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

on december 8 2004 and february 23 2005 the company asserted in two lawsuits in the same delaware court that one or more of the plaintiffs in the above action infringe two patents of the company us patent number 5385654 entitled “controlled temperature anion separation by capillary electrophoresis” and us patent number 6528784 entitled “mass spectrometer system including a double ion guide interface and method of operation” 

the lawsuits brought by the company seek relief similar to that being sought by the plaintiffs 

our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business we are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings including consolidated multiparty product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured these matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business as well as through acquisitions we believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers management after review and consideration with counsel considers that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows while liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material we currently believe on the basis of our claims history and related factors that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable see “item 1 — business — environmental matters” for legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters 

we are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including among others the us food and drug administration and the agency for international development various governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine matters relating to our operations some operations involve and have involved the handling manufacture use or sale of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws consequently some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses and we cannot assure that material damage will not occur or be discovered or that the damage will not be determined to be material in the future

management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

reference is made throughout this management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page f1 of this report 

thermo electron corporation and fisher scientific international inc announced on may 8 2006 that the boards of directors of both companies had unanimously approved a definitive agreement to combine the two companies in a taxfree stockforstock exchange the fisher businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical laboratories the fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals cellculture media and proprietary rnai technology to rapiddiagnostic tests safety products and other consumable supplies fisher had revenues of 54 billion in 2005 the transaction was approved by both companies’ shareholders in separate meetings held on august 30 2006 and following regulatory approvals was completed on november 9 2006 fisher’s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from november 9 2006 following the merger the company was renamed thermo fisher scientific inc 

overview of results of operations and liquidity   

the company develops  manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses in 2004 the company sold spectraphysics its optical technologies segment which has been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements following the merger with fisher the company’s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments analytical technologies and laboratory products and services revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers 

financial statement index 

 

 

the company’s revenues grew by 44 during 2006 including 32 from the fisher merger the weakening of the dollar relative to nonus currencies also caused an increase in reported revenues in addition to the change in revenues caused by acquisitions net of divestitures and currency translation which are discussed below sales increased 6 in 2006 primarily due to increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2006 and 2005 in addition to the merger with fisher the principal acquisitions included cohesive technologies inc a provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid chromatography products in december 2006 gv instruments limited a manufacturer of isotope ratio mass spectrometers which was acquired in july 2006 egs gauging inc a provider of flat polymer web gauging products which was acquired in june 2006 ionalytics corporation a provider of an ionfiltering device used with mass spectrometers which was acquired in august 2005 the kendro laboratory products division of spx corporation a provider of a wide range of laboratory equipment for sample preparation processing and storage which was acquired in may 2005 rupprecht and patashnick co inc rp a provider of continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for the ambient air emissions monitoring and industrial hygiene markets which was acquired in april 2005 and niton llc a provider of portable xray analyzers to the metals petrochemical and environmental markets which was acquired in march 2005 

in 2006 the company’s operating income and operating income margin were 242 million and 64 respectively compared with 263 million and 100 respectively in 2005 operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues the decrease in operating income and operating income margin was due to 125 million of pretax charges associated with the fisher merger described below and 93 million of higher amortization expense principally due to the fisher merger these items were offset in part by the inclusion of fisher’s results from november 9 2006 and higher profitability at existing businesses due to increased revenues productivity improvements including lower costs following restructuring actions and to a lesser extent price increases the company’s effective tax rate was 206 and 306 in 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits in particular lower income in the united states due to charges associated with the fisher merger partially offset by nondeductible merger related costs the provision for income taxes in 2005 includes 4 million for the estimated effect of tax audits of prior years in a nonus country this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 15 percentage points 

income from continuing operations decreased to 166 million in 2006 from 198 million in 2005 primarily due to the items discussed above that reduced operating income in 2006 and the inclusion of gains on the sale of investments in 2005 offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in 2006 

during 2006 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 406 million compared with 271 million in 2005 the increase resulted from improved cash flow at existing business and to a lesser extent cash flow from the fisher business net of 157 million in mergerrelated operating cash outflows including severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by fisher that were paid subsequent to november 9 2006 

financial statement index 

 

as of december 31  2006 the company’s outstanding debt totaled 27 billion of which 77 is due in 2009 and thereafter the company expects that its existing cash and shortterm investments of 691 million as of december 31 2006 and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowing capacity of up to 635 million under its existing 5year revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months

results of operations 

2006 compared with 2005 

continuing operations 

sales in 2006 were 3792 billion an increase of 1159 billion 44 from 2005 sales increased 978 million due to acquisitions principally fisher net of divestitures the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of 18 million in 2006 aside from the effect of acquisitions net of divestitures and currency translation revenues increased 163 million 6 primarily due to increased demand and to a lesser extent price increases as described by segment below growth was strong in asia and europe and moderate in north america 

 

in 2006 operating income and operating income margin were 242 million and 64 respectively compared with 263 million and 100 respectively in 2005 the decrease in operating income and operating income margin was due to 125 million of pretax charges associated with the fisher merger and 93 million of higher amortization expense principally due to the fisher merger the 125 million of charges includes 73 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of the merger 37 million of accelerated equitybased compensation due to a change in control occurring at the merger date and 15 million of inprocess research and development at fisher on the date of the merger the unfavorable effect of these items was offset in part by the inclusion of fisher’s results from november 9 2006 through the end of the year and higher profitability at existing businesses due to increased revenue productivity improvements including lower costs following restructuring actions and to a lesser extent price increases 

restructuring and other costs were recorded in 2006 and 2005 restructuring costs in 2005 were primarily for reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses resulting from the integration of kendro and the consolidation of two facilities in texas as well as charges associated with actions initiated prior to 2005 that could not be recorded until incurred and adjustments to previously provided reserves due to changes in estimates of amounts due for abandoned facilities net of expected subtenant rental income restructuring actions undertaken prior to 2005 were substantially complete at the end of 2004 aside from the 15 million charge for inprocess research and development existing at fisher on the date of merger discussed above restructuring costs in 2006 include charges to close a plant in massachusetts and consolidate its operations with those of an acquired kendro facility in north carolina charges for consolidation of a uk facility into an existing factory in germany the move of manufacturing operations in new mexico to other plants in the us and europe and remaining costs of prior actions the company is finalizing its plan for potential restructuring actions that may be undertaken at fisher or within existing businesses with which fisher is being integrated such actions may include rationalization of product lines consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels the cost of actions at fisher businesses is being charged to the cost of the acquisition while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with fisher is charged to expense the company expects to finalize its restructuring plans for fisher no later than one year from the date of merger the company has finalized its plans for integrating kendro with its existing business and expects that charges to expense will ultimately total approximately 16 million of which 15 million has been recorded as of december 31 2006 with the balance to be recorded as incurred also the company has identified actions totaling 5 million that will be undertaken in 2007 the restructuring actions initiated in 2006 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2006 and early 2007 of approximately 11 million including 6 million in the analytical technologies segment and 5 million in the laboratory products and services segment 

financial statement index

raw materials 

our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business 

patents licenses and trademarks 

patents are important in both segments of our business no particular patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts 

we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow 

seasonal influences 

revenues in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in the other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers 

working capital requirements 

there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

dependency on a single customer 

there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in any of the past three years 

backlog 

 

our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2005 and 2004 was as follows 

 

 

  we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2005 will be filled during 2006 the increase in backlog in 2005 in the life and laboratory sciences segment is due to acquisitions and to a lesser extent increased demand offset in part by the impact of currency translation

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government agencies no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

competition 

general 

the company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve because of the diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competitors and competition our competitors range from large organizations that produce a comprehensive array of products and services for a variety of markets to small organizations producing a limited number of products and services for specialized markets in general competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development our success in these markets primarily depends on five factors

risk factors 

tableend 

 

set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements beginning on page 3 

we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 

development of our products requires significant investment our products and technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products if we fail to adequately predict our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 

many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturingprocess levels these activities require us to make significant investments 

products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers’ requirements than we can the products that we are currently developing or those we will develop in the future may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete 

 

financial statement index 

 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

financial statement index 

 

    third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights for example in september 2004 applied biosystemsmds scientific instruments and related parties brought a lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held by the plaintiffs we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare providers government agencies and public and private research institutions many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 

our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future benefits from new productivity initiatives we continue to pursue practical process improvement ppi programs and other cost saving initiatives at our locations which are designed to further enhance our productivity efficiency and customer satisfaction while we anticipate continued benefits from these initiatives future benefits are expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve 

our measurement and control segment sells products and services to a number of companies that operate in cyclical industries downturns in those industries would adversely affect our results of operations the growth and profitability of some of our businesses in the measurement and control segment depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to cyclical downturns for example certain businesses in this segment depend in part on sales to the steel cement and semiconductor industries slowdowns in these industries would adversely affect sales by these businesses which in turn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our business in 2006 and beyond resulting in 

 

 

 

 

 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 

 

financial statement index 

 

if any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage the products sold by our environmental instruments division include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the product undetected which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability and competence of the customers’ operators and the training of such operators any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

our branding strategy could be unsuccessful we historically operated our business largely as autonomous unaffiliated companies and as a result each of our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names our marketing and branding strategy transitions multiple unrelated brands to one brand thermo electron several of our former brands such as finnigan and nicolet commanded strong market recognition and customer loyalty we believe the transition to the one brand enhances and strengthens our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire company our success in promoting our brand depends on many factors including effective communication of the transition to our customers acceptance and recognition by customers of this brand and successful execution of the branding campaign by our marketing and sales teams if we are not successful with this strategy we may experience erosion in our product recognition brand image and customer loyalty and a decrease in demand for our products 

our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory including antitrust approvals we may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company further we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business for example we will need to integrate the kendro business that we recently acquired in order to realize its anticipated cost savings and synergies 

moreover we have acquired many companies and businesses as a result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet which amounts to approximately 197 billion as of december 31 2005 we assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold from 1997 through 2004 we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of 2 billion as part of these transactions we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses such as lawsuits product liability and environmental claims and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

 

financial statement index 

 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets in 2005 our international revenues from continuing operations including export revenues from the united states accounted for approximately 58 of our total revenues the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the “functional currency” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in 2005 currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of 45 million due to a strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services in 2004 currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of 921 million due to weakening of the us dollar 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment 

unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could interfere with our operations as a part of the effort to upgrade our current information systems we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations as we implement and add functionality problems could arise that we have not foreseen such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes take customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business in addition if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins as a result our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected   

our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 5988 million in outstanding indebtedness 

we have 250 million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility and 83 million available under our euro facility we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions 

 

financial statement index 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the financial covenants in our us dollar revolving credit facility and euro facility include interest coverage and debttocapital ratios specifically the company agrees that so long as the commitments remain in effect or any loan or other amount is outstanding under the loan agreements it will not permit as the following terms are defined in the loan agreements 

 

 

our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments   would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments 

earthquakes could disrupt our operations in california one of the company’s principal operations which manufactures analytical instruments is located in san jose a region near major california earthquake faults our operating results could be materially affected in the event of a major earthquake

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

reference is made throughout this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements which begin on page f1 of this report 

overview of results of operations and liquidity   

the company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses in 2004 the company sold spectraphysics its optical technologies segment which has been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements the company’s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments life and laboratory sciences and measurement and control revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial pharmaceutical and government customers 

 

 

      the company’s revenues grew by 19 during 2005 the increase was due in part to acquisitions net of divestitures the strengthening of the dollar relative to nonus currencies caused a decrease in reported revenues in addition to the change in revenues caused by acquisitions net of divestitures and currency translation which are discussed below sales increased 4 in 2005 primarily due to increased demand and to a lesser extent higher prices 

the company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2005 and 2004 the principal acquisitions included ionalytics corporation a provider of an ionfiltering device used with mass spectrometers which was acquired in august 2005 the kendro laboratory products division of spx corporation a provider of a wide range of laboratory equipment for sample preparation processing and storage which was acquired in may 2005 rupprecht and patashnick co inc rp a provider of continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for the ambient air emissions monitoring and industrial hygiene markets which was acquired in april 2005 niton llc a provider of portable xray analyzers to the metals petrochemical and environmental markets which was acquired in march 2005 innaphase corporation a supplier of laboratory information management systems for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets which was acquired in september 2004 and us counseling services inc uscs a supplier of equipment asset management services to the pharmaceutical healthcare and related industries which was acquired in april 2004 

 

financial statement index 

 

in 2005 the company’s operating income and operating income margin were 2635 million and 100 respectively compared with 2375 million and 108 respectively in 2004 operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues the increase in operating income was due to higher revenues productivity improvements including lower costs following restructuring actions and to a lesser extent price increases offset in part by 548 million of higher amortization expense associated with acquisitionrelated intangible assets operating income margin decreased due to lower operating margins on revenue from acquisitions as a result of amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets restructuring and other costs net including charges to cost of revenues principally associated with the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition reduced operating income by 303 million and 192 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

the company’s effective tax rate was 306 and 158 in 2005 and 2004 respectively the provision for income taxes in 2005 includes 42 million for the estimated effect of tax audits of prior years in a nonus country this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 15 percentage points the provision for income taxes in 2004 includes a benefit of 338 million associated with the settlement of us and state tax audits of prior years this benefit reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 130 percentage points 

income from continuing operations decreased to 1983 million in 2005 from 2184 million in 2004 primarily due to the effect of tax audits in both years and higher amortization expense discussed above offset in part by higher operating income from increased revenues as well as an increase in other income 

during 2005 the company’s cash flow from operations totaled 2709 million compared with 2645 million in 2004 

as of december 31 2005 the company’s outstanding debt totaled 5988 million of which 65 is due in 2008 and thereafter the company expects that its existing cash and shortterm investments of 2950 million as of december 31 2005 and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowings of up to 250 million under its existing 5year revolving credit agreement and available unsecured borrowings under its 5year euro facility are sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months 

critical accounting policies 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to equity investments bad debts inventories intangible assets warranty obligations income taxes pension costs contingencies and litigation restructuring and sale of businesses the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and equity prices which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities additionally the company uses shortterm forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies the company enters into forward currencyexchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ local currencies the company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities however the purpose of the company’s currency hedging activities is to protect the company’s local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company’s forward currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euros us dollars british pounds sterling and canadian dollars income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the company does not enter into speculative currency agreements 

interest rates 

certain of the company’s shortterm availableforsale investments longterm notes receivable and longterm obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument a 10 decrease in yearend 2005 and 2004 market interest rates would result in a net negative impact to the company of 9 million and 5 million respectively on the net fair value of its interestsensitive financial instruments 

in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments a 100basispoint increase in 90day libor at december 31 2005 and 2004 would increase the company’s annual pretax interest expense by 1 million a 100basispoint increase in 90 day euribor at december 31 2005 would increase the company’s annual pretax interest expense by 1 million 

currency exchange rates 

the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent the company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros british pounds sterling and japanese yen the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity a 10 depreciation in yearend 2005 and 2004 functional currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 66 million and 106 million respectively 

the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange rates a 10 appreciation in yearend 2005 and 2004 currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 07 million and 59 million respectively the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged

new products and research and development

       our business includes the development and introduction of new products
and may include entry into new business segments we are not currently committed
to any new products that require the investment of a material amount of our
funds nor do we have any definitive plans to enter new businesses that would
require such an investment

       during 2004 2003 and 2002 we spent 1347 million 1280 million and
1320 million respectively on research and development

raw materials

       our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of
raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do
not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our
business

patents licenses and trademarks

       patents are important in both segments of our business no particular
patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss
would significantly affect our operations as a whole where appropriate we seek
patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and
incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of
interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not
always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or
contracts

       we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where
appropriate we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with
products we also enter into license agreements with others to grant andor
receive rights to patents and knowhow

seasonal influences

       revenues in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in
the other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial
pharmaceutical and government customers

working capital requirements

       there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to
customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital

dependency on a single customer

       there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material
adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 10 of our
total revenues in any of the past three years

backlog

       our backlog in continuing operations of firm orders at yearend 2004 and
2003 was as follows



                                                                                                                   

                                                                                                              2004         2003
                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                               in thousands

       life and laboratory sciences                                                                         339662     261033
       measurement and control                                                                               127329      108603
                                                                                                                 

                                                                                                            466991     369636
                                                                                                                 


       we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2004 will be
filled during 2005 the increase in backlog in 2004 is due to acquisitions and
to a lesser extent currency translation and increased demand

government contracts

       although the company transacts business with various government agencies
no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or
termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have
a material adverse effect on the companys financial results

overview of results of operations and liquidity

       the company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are
sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by
developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic
acquisitions of complementary businesses during 2000 and 2001 the company
carried out the principal aspects of a major reorganization plan under which it
sold or spun off many noncore businesses in 2004 the company sold
spectraphysics its optical technologies segment as a result of these actions
the companys continuing operations are comprised solely of its instrument
businesses the businesses that have been spun off and sold have been presented
as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements the
companys continuing operations fall into two principal business segments life
and laboratory sciences and measurement and control

       the companys revenues grew by 16 during 2004 the strengthening of
nonus currencies relative to the dollar caused an increase in reported
revenues as did acquisitions net of divestitures in addition to the change in
revenues caused by currency translation and acquisitions net of divestitures
which are discussed below sales increased 4 in 2004 primarily due to
increased demand the higher demand resulted primarily from a recovery in the
us and asian economies that has positively affected capital spending across
many markets addressed by the company together with growth from new product
introductions

       the companys strategy is to augment internal growth at existing
businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2004 and
2003 the principal acquisitions included innaphase corporation a supplier of
laboratory information management systems for the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology markets which was acquired in september 2004 us counseling
services inc uscs a supplier of equipment asset management services to the
pharmaceutical healthcare and related industries which was acquired in april
2004 jouan sa a global supplier of products used to prepare and preserve
laboratory samples which was acquired in december 2003 laboratory management
systems inc lmsi a supplier of regulatory instrument and consulting
services to the pharmaceutical and related industries which was acquired in
november 2003 and the personal radiationdetection instruments product line
from siemens plc which was acquired in october 2003



                           thermo electron corporation


       in 2004 the companys operating income and operating income margin
improved to 2375 million and 108 respectively from 1874 million and
99 respectively in 2003 operating income margin is operating income
divided by revenues the improvement resulted primarily from lower
restructuring costs net in 2004 and a lower cost base following restructuring
actions in 2003 and to a lesser extent higher revenues offset in part by
138 million of higher amortization expense associated with acquisitionrelated
intangible assets restructuring and other costs net including charges to
cost of revenues associated with the sale of inventories revalued at the date of
acquisition and facility consolidations reduced operating income by 192
million and 453 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively

       the companys effective tax rate was 158 and 213 in 2004 and 2003
respectively the effective tax rate in 2004 includes a benefit of 338 million
associated with the settlement of tax audits the effective tax rate in 2003
includes a tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance for tax credit
carryforwards of 90 million and a tax benefit of 37 million from the sale of
a business the company expects its effective tax rate in 2005 for its existing
business will be approximately 29

       income from continuing operations increased to 2184 million in 2004
from 1752 million in 2003 primarily due to the higher operating income
discussed above offset in part by lower gains from the sale of investments

       during 2004 the companys cash flow from operations totaled 2645
million compared with 2147 million in 2003 the increase resulted primarily
from higher income offset in part by increased investment in working capital in
2004

       as of december 31 2004 the companys outstanding debt totaled 2411
million of which 93 is due in 2007 and thereafter the company expects to
borrow up to 600 million in 2005 through a 364day bridge financing commitment
obtained in connection with the january 2005 agreement to acquire kendro
laboratory products for 8335 million subject to a postclosing adjustment
the commitment is subject to customary conditions for financings of this type
the company expects that its existing cash and shortterm investments of 5123
million as of december 31 2004 and the companys future cash flow from
operations together with available unsecured borrowings of up to 250 million
under its existing 5year revolving credit agreement and commitment for funds to
acquire kendro are sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the
foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months

critical accounting policies

       the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and
results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires
the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates
including those related to equity investments bad debts inventories
intangible assets warranty obligations income taxes pension costs
contingencies and litigation restructuring and sale of businesses the company
bases its estimates on historical experience current market and economic
conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable the
results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value
of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other
sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions

       the company believes the following represent its critical accounting
policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements

       a   the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
             estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to
             pay amounts due such allowances totaled 228 million at december
             31 2004 the company estimates the amount of customer receivables
             that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable the
             creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is
             relevant to the judgment if the financial condition of the
             companys customers were to deteriorate reducing their ability to
             make payments additional allowances would be required



                           thermo electron corporation


       b   the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence
             for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value
             taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months
             expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the
             judgment if ultimate usage or demand vary significantly from
             expected usage or demand additional writedowns may be required

       c   the company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using
             forecasts of discounted future cash flows goodwill totaled 151
             billion at december 31 2004 estimates of future cash flows
             require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth
             assetrelated expenditures working capital levels and other
             factors different assumptions from those made in the companys
             analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the
             companys evaluation of goodwill for impairment should the fair
             value of the companys goodwill decline because of reduced
             operating performance market declines or other indicators of
             impairment charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary

       d   the company estimates the fair value of acquisitionrelated
             intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows
             that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired
             businesses the projected cash flows are discounted to determine
             the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition actual
             cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary
             from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying
             values and annual amortization expense from those established at
             the dates of acquisition

       e   the company reviews other longlived assets for impairment when
             indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant
             reduction in cash flows associated with the assets other
             longlived assets totaled 5940 million at december 31 2004
             including 2610 million of fixed assets in testing a longlived
             asset for impairment assumptions are made concerning projected
             cash flows associated with the asset estimates of future cash
             flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income
             growth and assetrelated expenditures associated with the asset
             being reviewed for impairment should future cash flows decline
             significantly from estimated amounts charges for impairment of
             other longlived assets may be necessary

       f   in instances where the company sells equipment with a related
             installation obligation the company generally recognizes revenue
             related to the equipment when title passes the company recognizes
             revenue related to the installation when it performs the
             installation the allocation of revenue between the equipment and
             the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of
             sale should the fair value of either the equipment or the
             installation change the companys revenue recognition would be
             affected if fair value is not available for any undelivered
             element revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is
             completed

       g   in instances where the company sells equipment with customer
             specified acceptance criteria the company must assess whether it
             can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the
             customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue
             recognition if the nature of customerspecified acceptance
             criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company
             could not demonstrate adherence the company would be required to
             defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until
             completion of customer acceptance testing

       h   the companys software license agreements generally include
             multiple products and services or elements the company
             recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method
             after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific
             objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered
             elements in the event vsoe is not available for any undelivered
             element revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is
             completed revenues from software maintenance and support contracts
             are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the
             contract vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is
             determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and
             support when sold separately revenues from training and consulting
             services are recognized as services are performed based on vsoe
             which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when
             the services are sold separately



                           thermo electron corporation


       i   at the time the company recognizes revenue it provides for the
             estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical
             experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that
             indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical
             patterns the liability for warranty obligations of the companys
             continuing operations totaled 274 million at december 31 2004
             should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting
             product failures vary from estimates revisions to the estimated
             warranty liability would be necessary

       j   the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss
             carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected
             profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation
             allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes
             will more likely than not go unused if it becomes more likely than
             not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company
             reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally
             to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions
             the companys tax valuation allowance totaled 662 million at
             december 31 2004 should the companys actual future taxable
             income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional
             allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary

       k   the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in
             the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates accrued
             income taxes totaled 228 million at december 31 2004 should tax
             return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be
             sustained upon audit the company could be required to record an
             incremental tax provision for such taxes should previously
             unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained a reduction in
             the companys tax provision would result

       l   the company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation for
             which a loss is probable and provides a reserve for losses that can
             be reasonably estimated should the ultimate losses on
             contingencies and litigation vary from estimates adjustments to
             those reserves may be required

       m   one of the companys us subsidiaries and several nonus
             subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans major
             assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans
             include the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate
             of increase in employee compensation levels assumptions are
             determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators
             in consultation with third party actuaries and are evaluated each
             year as of the plans measurement date net periodic pension costs
             for defined benefit plans totaled 95 million in 2004 should any
             of these assumptions change they would have an effect on net
             periodic pension costs

       n   the company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating
             facilities based on future lease obligations and expected
             subrental income the companys accrued restructuring costs for
             abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled 98 million
             at december 31 2004 should actual cash flows associated with
             subrental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated
             amounts adjustments may be required

       o   the company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held
             for sale and when necessary records losses to reduce the carrying
             value of these assets to estimated realizable value should the
             actual or estimated proceeds which would include postclosing
             purchase price adjustments vary from current estimates results
             could differ from expected amounts

       p   the company considers declines in quoted fair market values of
             availableforsale investments and other equity investments with
             durations of six to nine months as indicative that the decline may
             be other than temporary as of december 31 2004 the company held
             3220000 shares of newport corporation common stock which it
             received as partial consideration in the july 2004 sale of
             spectraphysics the cost and quoted fair market value of the
             shares at december 31 2004 were 450 million and 454 million
             respectively should a decline in quoted fair market value occur
             an impairment charge may be required

in 2003 operating income margin increased to 108 in 2004 from 99 in 2003
operating income increased primarily due to lower restructuring and other costs
net and to a lesser extent higher revenues in each segment in 2004 operating
income in 2004 and 2003 was reduced by additional charges associated with
restructuring actions initiated in those and prior years and certain other
costs net note 15 the restructuring and other items totaled 192 million
and 453 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively and are discussed by segment
below

       restructuring actions were initiated in 2003 and to a lesser extent in
2004 in a number of business units to reduce costs and redundancies in response
to a downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with the
companys overall reorganization principally through headcount reductions and
consolidation of facilities the actions initiated in 2004 resulted in annual
cost savings of approximately 10 million including 7 million in the life and
laboratory sciences segment and 3 million in the measurement and control
segment the company expects to incur an additional 1 million of restructuring
costs primarily in 2005 for charges associated with these actions that cannot
be recorded until incurred in connection with the planned acquisition of
kendro the company expects to undertake restructuring actions at both acquired
and existing facilities the actions at acquired facilities will be recorded as
a cost of the acquisition the actions at existing facilities will be charged to
expense the company has not finalized its plans for integrating kendro with its
existing business but expects that charges to expense will total 1020 million
following the acquisition

       sales in the life and laboratory sciences segment increased 2804
million or 22 to 1573 billion in 2004 the favorable effects of currency
translation resulted in an increase in revenues of 667 million in 2004 sales
increased 1531 million due to the acquisitions of innaphase in september 2004
uscs in april 2004 jouan in december 2003 and lmsi in november 2003 net of
product line divestitures in addition to the changes in revenue resulting from
currency translation acquisitions and divestitures revenues increased 606
million or 5 due to higher demand the increase in demand resulted
principally in higher sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments



                           thermo electron corporation


and to a lesser extent new anatomical pathology products and laboratory
informatics the combination of new products and a rebound in sales to
industrial markets along with continued strength in pharmaceutical demand have
driven the instrument sales growth offset in part by lower revenues in europe
where the recovery of demand has lagged the us and asia the increase in
revenues was offset in part by 56 million of lower revenue from rapid
diagnostic tests due to a weak flu season in 2004 following a harsh season in
2003

       operating income margin was 143 in 2004 and 142 in 2003 operating
income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs net of 102
million and 218 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively as discussed below
the favorable impact of lower restructuring and other costs net and higher
revenues was substantially offset by a 132 million increase in amortization
expense of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and the inclusion of jouan
uscs and lmsi which have historically operated at lower profitability margins
compared with the segments existing businesses

       in 2004 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of
102 million including charges to cost of revenues of 32 million consisting
of 21 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition
of jouan and 11 million of accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being
abandoned due to facility consolidations the segment incurred 86 million of
cash costs primarily for severance abandoned facilities and relocation
expenses at businesses that have been consolidated in addition the segment
recorded a gain of 26 million on the sale of a product line and a loss of 10
million from the writedown of abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned
buildings in 2003 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of
218 million including 188 million of cash costs primarily for severance
abandoned facilities employee retention and relocation expenses at businesses

       sales in the measurement and control segment increased 314 million or
5 to 6326 million in 2004 the favorable effects of currency translation
resulted in an increase in revenues of 254 million in 2004 sales decreased
135 million due to divestitures net of acquisitions the principal
divestiture was the segments test and measurement business which it sold in
october 2003 in addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency
translation acquisitions and divestitures revenues increased 195 million
or 3 the increase was primarily the result of a rebound in demand for
precision temperaturecontrol products from the semiconductor industry and other
process applications and to a lesser extent process instruments used by the
materials industry and equipment used in metal production particularly in
china

       operating income margin increased to 84 in 2004 from 74 in 2003
operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs net of
65 million and 103 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively as discussed
below nearly half of the increase in operating income margin resulted from the
38 million reduction in restructuring and other costs net with the balance
from higher sales volumes and cost reduction measures following restructuring
actions

       in 2004 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of 65
million including cash costs of 62 million principally for severance
abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been
consolidated in addition the segment recorded charges of 01 million for the
writedown of equipment at an abandoned facility and charges to cost of revenues
of 02 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition

abandoned facilities employee retention and relocation expenses at businesses
being consolidated in addition the segment recorded charges of 20 million
primarily for the writedown of goodwill in the test and measurement business to
reduce the carrying value to disposal value and for the writedown of assets at
facilities being consolidated offset by a gain of 21 million on the sale of a
building the segment also recorded charges to cost of revenues of 01 million
for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition note 15

other income net

       the company reported other income net of 217 million and 352
million in 2004 and 2003 respectively note 4 other income net includes
interest income interest expense gain on investments net equity in earnings
of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items net interest income decreased
to 90 million in 2004 from 197 million in 2003 primarily due to lower
invested cash balances following the acquisitions net of divestitures in late
2003 and 2004 and the use of cash for the repurchase and redemption of company
securities interest expense decreased to 110 million in 2004 from 182
million in 2003 as a result of the repurchase and redemption of debentures

       during 2004 and 2003 the company had gains on investments net of 208
million and 355 million respectively the gains included 96 million in 2004
and 163 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of thoratec corporation and
137 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of flir systems inc the company
obtained common shares of thoratec as part of the sale of thermo cardiosystems
inc in 2001 and obtained an equity interest in flir as part of the acquisition
of spectraphysics ab in 1999 other income in 2004 and 2003 also includes
currency transaction gains and losses and equity in earnings of unconsolidated
subsidiaries in addition the company repurchased and redeemed debentures
resulting in a charge of 10 million during 2003

provision for income taxes

       the companys effective tax rate was 158 and 213 in 2004 and 2003
respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2004 primarily due to 338
million of tax benefits associated with the completion of tax audits the
companys tax returns and those of several subsidiaries were under audit for the
period 1998 to 2000 in 2004 and early 2005 the irs and the company reached
final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously
unrecognized tax benefits were realizable in addition audits of state tax
returns were also completed in 2004 the 2003 effective tax rate was favorably
affected by 90 million of tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation
allowance due to expected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards note
6 and 37 million of tax benefit from the sale of a business these tax
benefits reduced the companys 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates by 130
percentage points and 57 percentage points respectively the 2003 effective
tax rate was also favorably affected by the fullyear impact of a reorganization
throughout 2002 of the companys subsidiaries in several european countries that
resulted in a more taxefficient corporate structure and a decrease in 2003 of
gains from the sale of investment securities in addition the company reduced
its effective tax rate by 18 percentage points in 2003 through repatriation of
cash from nonus subsidiaries which resulted in foreign tax credits the
company expects its effective tax rate in 2005 for its existing business will be
approximately 29

       the american jobs creation act of 2004 signed into law in october 2004
allows companies to repatriate permanently reinvested nonus earnings in 2005
or 2006 at an effective rate of 525 the company does not currently expect to
take advantage of this provision the new tax law also phases out an existing
deduction based on export revenues and replaces it with a deduction for a
portion of the profit derived from domestic manufacturing activities the
company is continuing to evaluate the effect of this change but does not expect
a material impact on its tax provision

contingent liabilities

       at yearend 2004 the company was contingently liable with respect to
certain lawsuits an unfavorable outcome in either of the two pending matters
described in note 11 could materially affect the companys financial position as
well as its results of operations and cash flows

income from continuing operations

       income from continuing operations was 2184 million in 2004 compared
with 1752 million in 2003 results in both periods were affected by
restructuring gains on the sale of thoratec shares and other items discussed
above

recent accounting pronouncements

       in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment
sfas no 123r amends sfas no 123 to require that companies record as expense
the effect of equitybased compensation including stock options over the
applicable vesting period the company currently discloses the effect on income
that stock options would have were they recorded as expense sfas no 123r
also requires more extensive disclosures concerning stock options than required
under current standards the new rule applies to option grants made after
adoption as well as options that are not vested at the date of adoption sfas
no 123r becomes effective no later than fiscal periods beginning after june
15 2005 the company does not currently expect to elect early adoption and has
not determined whether it will apply the new standard prospectively in the third
quarter of 2005 retroactively from the beginning of 2005 or restate all
periods on a comparable basis

       in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs  an
amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 which is the result of its efforts to
converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting
standards sfas no 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense
freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage to be recognized as
currentperiod charges it also requires that allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities sfas no 151 will be effective for inventory costs
incurred during 2006 the company is currently evaluating the impact this
standard will have on its financial statements

discontinued operations

       the company had aftertax gains of 1005 million in 2004 and 273
million in 2003 from the disposal of discontinued operations

       in june 2004 the company announced it had entered into a definitive
agreement for the sale of its optical technologies segment spectraphysics to
newport corporation on july 16 2004 the company completed the sale the
company has reclassified the results of spectraphysics as discontinued
operations for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements

       the companys discontinued operations spectraphysics had revenues
through the date of sale of 1189 million and 1978 million in 2004 and 2003
respectively net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale
in 2004 was 45 million net of a tax provision of 22 million the companys
discontinued operations incurred a net loss in 2003 of 25 million net of a
tax benefit of 15 million the improvement resulted from a rebound in the
demand for lasers and photonics from microelectronics customers and other
industrial markets served by spectraphysics as a result of the decision to
sell spectraphysics a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the
difference between the book and tax basis of spectraphysics became realizable
and the company recorded a tax benefit as income from discontinued operations
totaling 385 million in 2004 in 2004 the company recorded a gain on the sale
of spectraphysics of 459 million net of a tax provision of 159 million

       in addition to the 2004 gains discussed above the company had 13
million of aftertax gains and 06 million of tax benefits associated with
discontinued operations

       the 2003 gain consists of two pretax components and two tax components

divestitures net of acquisitions in addition to the changes in revenue
resulting from currency translation divestitures and acquisitions revenues
decreased 577 million or 3 primarily due to lower demand as described by

reduced by charges associated with restructuring plans initiated during 2002 and
2001 and certain other costs net the restructuring and other items totaled
453 million and 462 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively and are
discussed by segment below operating income increased primarily due to a lower
cost base following recent restructuring actions among the other actions
contributing to a lower cost base was lower spending on research and development
activities which decreased 3 to 1280 million in 2003 as the company focused
on those projects with the highest estimated returns

       in response to a continued downturn in markets served by the company and
in connection with the companys overall reorganization restructuring actions
were initiated in 2003 in a number of business units to reduce costs and
redundancies principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of
facilities these actions resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in mid
to late 2003 and continuing in early 2004 of approximately 11 million
including 7 million in the life and laboratory sciences segment and 4 million
in the measurement and control segment

       in november 2002 the emerging issues task force eitf reached a
consensus on eitf issue no 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with
multiple deliverables the company began applying the consensus prospectively
in the first quarter of 2003 under eitf issue no 0021 the company recognizes
revenue and related costs for arrangements with customers that have multiple
deliverables such as equipment and installation as each element is delivered
or completed based on its fair value when a portion of the customers payment
is not due until installation the company defers that portion of the revenue
until completion of installation the adoption of eitf issue no 0021 did not

decreased 97 million due to product line divestitures net of acquisitions in
addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation
divestitures and acquisitions revenues increased 124 million or 1 a 133
million increase in sales of clinical diagnostic products was offset in part by
decreased sales of bioscience instrumentation principally due to a downturn in
demand from pharmaceutical and industrial markets the increase in sales of
clinical diagnostic products resulted primarily from higher demand for rapid
diagnostic tests during a harsh flu season in the united states and to a lesser
extent increased demand for a newly released tissue processor used in
anatomical pathology laboratories

       operating income margin decreased to 142 in 2003 from 144 in 2002
operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs net of
218 million and 194 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively in addition to
the increase in restructuring and other costs in 2003 the decrease in operating
income margin resulted from higher marketing and selling expenses due to several
key commercial initiatives the segments commercial initiatives included key
customer account management increased advertising costs for a branding
transition and establishment of customer call centers and product demonstration
facilities these cost increases were offset in part by cost savings from
facility consolidations and related productivity measures the cost reduction
measures in 2002 and 2003 reduced the segments cost base by an aggregate of
approximately 14 million on an annualized basis

       in 2003 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of
218 million including 188 million of cash costs primarily for severance

       sales in the measurement and control segment decreased 286 million or
5 to 6011 million in 2003 the favorable effects of currency translation
resulted in an increase in revenues of 301 million in 2003 sales increased
33 million due to acquisitions net of divestitures in addition to the
changes in revenue resulting from currency translation acquisitions and
divestitures revenues decreased 620 million or 10 of this amount 268
million or 4 was due to the inclusion in the fourth quarter of 2002 of a
shipment of explosivesdetection equipment to the us transportation security
administration following a congressional mandate to screen all checked airline
baggage in the united states by the end of 2002 the balance of the decrease was
primarily the result of weaker demand arising from economic conditions facing
customers particularly in the process instruments businesses where
approximately 60 of the remaining decrease occurred process instruments are
generally used in industrial markets such as minerals and mining and
petrochemical applications where capital expenditures slowed in addition a 7
decrease in sales of equipment used primarily in semiconductor applications was
offset in part by higher revenues from equipment used in homeland security

       operating income margin increased to 74 in 2003 from 73 in 2002
operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs net of
103 million and 136 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in
operating income margin resulted primarily from cost reduction measures
following restructuring actions in 2002 and 2003 and to a lesser extent 33
million of lower restructuring and other costs net offset in part by the
effect on operating margin of lower revenues the cost reduction measures in
2002 and 2003 reduced the segments cost base by an aggregate of approximately
17 million on an annualized basis

       in 2003 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of
103 million including cash costs of 103 million principally for severance
abandoned facilities employee retention and relocation expenses at businesses
being consolidated in addition the segment recorded charges of 20 million
primarily for the writedown of goodwill in the test and measurement business to
reduce the carrying value to disposal value and for the writedown of assets at
facilities being consolidated offset by a gain of 21 million on the sale of a
building the segment also recorded charges to cost of revenues of 01 million
primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition in
2002 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of 136 million
including 204 million of cash costs principally for severance abandoned

writedowns note 15

other income net

       the company reported other income net of 352 million and 1315
million in 2003 and 2002 respectively note 4 interest income decreased to
197 million in 2003 from 476 million in 2002 primarily due to lower
invested cash balances following the repurchase and redemption of company
securities the payment of shortterm notes payable and to a lesser extent
lower prevailing interest rates interest expense decreased to 182 million in
2003 from 402 million in 2002 as a result of the redemption maturity and
repurchase of debentures as well as the full year effect of entering into
interestrate swap arrangements in the first quarter of 2002 offset in part by
interest on borrowings under securitieslending arrangements

       during 2003 and 2002 the company had gains on investments net of 355
million and 1231 million respectively the gains included 163 million in
2003 from the sale of shares of thoratec and 137 million and 1114 million in
2003 and 2002 respectively from the sale of shares of flir the company
recorded income from equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of 25
million in 2002 primarily related to the investment in flir effective march
30 2002 following a reduction in the companys percentage ownership of flir to
less then 20 the company no longer reported its prorata share of flir
earnings but instead accounted for its remaining investment as an
availableforsale security note 4 in addition the company repurchased and
redeemed debentures resulting in charges of 10 million and 15 million
during 2003 and 2002 respectively

provision for income taxes

       the companys effective tax rate was 213 and 325 in 2003 and 2002
respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2003 primarily due to 90
million of tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance due to
expected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards note 6 and 37
million of tax benefit from the sale of a business these tax benefits reduced
the companys 2003 effective tax rate by 57 percentage points the decrease was
also due in part to the fullyear impact on the 2003 effective tax rate of a
reorganization throughout 2002 of the companys subsidiaries in several european
countries that resulted in a more taxefficient corporate structure and a
decrease in 2003 of gains from the sale of investment securities in addition
the company reduced its effective tax rate by 18 percentage points in 2003
through repatriation of cash from nonus subsidiaries which resulted in
foreign tax credits

income from continuing operations

       income from continuing operations was 1752 million in 2003 compared
with 2034 million in 2002 results in both periods were affected by
restructuring gains on the sale of thoratec and flir shares and other items
discussed above

discontinued operations

       the companys discontinued operations spectraphysics had revenues of
1978 million and 2370 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively the decrease
in revenues resulted principally from a severe slowdown in the semiconductor and
other industrial markets net loss of the discontinued operations was 25
million and 91 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively net of tax benefits of
15 million and 55 million respectively the improvement was due to lower
restructuring costs in 2003 and cost reduction measures

       the company had aftertax gains of 273 million in 2003 and 1154
million in 2002 from the disposal of discontinued operations the 2003 gain
consists of two pretax components and two tax components in 2003 the company
resolved several disputes and related claims that it had retained following the
sale of businesses in its discontinued operations in connection with the
resolution of these matters on favorable terms relative to the damages estimated
and amount of established reserves as well as the settlement of lease
obligations the companys pretax gain recorded in prior years on disposal of
the related businesses increased by 271 million in 2003 the company also
sold the last remaining business in discontinued operations peter brotherhood
and received additional proceeds associated with businesses sold prior to 2003
including postclosing purchase price adjustments the company recorded pretax
gains from the disposal of discontinued operations of 83 million
substantially as a result of these transactions the company recorded a tax
provision of 132 million on the above gains and realized 51 million of
additional tax benefits from the disposal of businesses sold prior to 2003
principally foreign tax credits

       during 2002 primarily as a result of new tax regulations concerning
deductible losses from divested businesses the company revised its estimate of
the tax consequences of business disposals in discontinued operations and
recorded a tax benefit of 466 million in addition in 2002 the company sold
its trophy radiologie business for approximately 51 million in cash and
principally as a result of this transaction recorded an aftertax gain of 174
million also the company sold the last remaining component of its former
powergeneration business in 2002 and realized a gain from the disposition
totaling 130 million primarily for previously unrecognized tax benefits that
were realized upon the sale

       in february 2001 the company sold its interest in thermo cardiosystems
to thoratec in exchange for 193 million shares of thoratec common stock
certain restrictions which lapsed in august 2002 limited the timing of the
companys ability to sell these shares following a sale of shares in february
2002 for net proceeds of 104 million and an aftertax gain of 384 million
the company owned less than 20 of thoratecs outstanding shares and began
accounting for its investment as an availableforsale security in continuing
operations in the first quarter of 2002 with unrealized gains or losses
recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive items in the accompanying
balance sheet

       this table excludes 912 million of other longterm liabilities
principally pension liabilities and 152 million of deferred income taxes as
these liabilities are not subject to fixed payment schedules

       the company has no material commitments for purchases of property plant
and equipment but expects that for 2005 such expenditures for its existing
business will approximate 43 to 47 million

       in connection with the january 2005 agreement to acquire kendro for
8335 million subject to a postclosing adjustment the company obtained a
bridge financing commitment which will permit it to borrow up to 600 million
for a period of 364 days on terms substantially equivalent to those of its
existing 5year revolving credit agreement the company expects to use cash from
this commitment and existing cash balances to fund the acquisition of kendro
the commitment is subject to customary conditions for financings of this type

       the company believes that its existing resources including cash and
investments future cash flow from operations and available borrowings under
its existing 5year revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet the
working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable
future including at least the next 24 months

new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry
standards without the timely introduction of new products services and
enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically
obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would
suffer

       our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture
their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop
products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products if we
fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities we may
invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not
lead to significant revenue

       many of our existing products and those under development are
technologically innovative and require significant planning design
development and testing at the technological product and
manufacturingprocess levels these activities require us to make significant
investments

       products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological
change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of
new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies
uncompetitive or obsolete our competitors may adapt more quickly to new
technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can the products
that we are currently developing or those we will develop in the future may
not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace and our products
or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete

       our measurement and control segment sells products and services to a
number of companies that operate in cyclical industries downturns in those
industries would adversely affect our results of operations the growth and
profitability of some of our businesses in the measurement and control segment
depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to cyclical downturns
for example certain businesses in this segment depend in part on sales to the
steel cement and semiconductor industries slowdowns in these industries would
adversely affect sales by these businesses which in turn would adversely affect
our revenues and results of operations

       our business is impacted by general economic conditions and related
uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate adverse economic conditions
could adversely impact our business in 2005 and beyond resulting in

          reduced demand for some of our products

          increased rate of order cancellations or delays

          increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories

          increased pressure on the prices for our products and services and

          greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable



                           thermo electron corporation


       changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or
increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers
must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as
environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop
configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those
regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our
products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are
marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing
drugs changes in the us food and drug administrations regulation of the drug
discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for
these products

       demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of
our customers and on government funding policies our customers include
pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare
providers government agencies and public and private research institutions
many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources
and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital
spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a
significant effect on the demand for our products

       our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material
adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we
infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation
or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining
patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products
and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing
new products through the development process and into the marketplace our
success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain
and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in
other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file
additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products
patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by
or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be
sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or
licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights
under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition
competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign
countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased
market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits
brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against
others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely
affect our business and results of operations

       we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow which we seek to
protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our
collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets
may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors

       third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are
infringing on their intellectual property rights for example in september 2004
applied biosystemsmds scientific instruments and related parties brought a
lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held
by the plaintiffs we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management
resources in defending these claims which could have a material adverse effect
on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition
parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial
damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could
effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our
products and services in the united states or abroad in the event that a claim
relating to intellectual property is asserted against us or third parties not
affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or
technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge
those patents however we may be unable to obtain these licenses on
commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the patents may
be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights
could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our products and
therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial
condition and results of operations



                           thermo electron corporation


       if any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation
we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not
have adequate insurance coverage the products sold by our environmental
instruments division include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable
instruments used for chemical radiation and trace explosives detection these
products are used in airports embassies cargo facilities border crossings
and other highthreat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist
acts if any of these products were to malfunction it is possible that
explosive or radioactive material could pass through the product undetected
which could lead to product liability claims there are also many other factors
beyond our control that could lead to liability claims such as the reliability
and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators
any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and
any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance
coverage although we carry product liability insurance we cannot be certain
that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it
can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all

       we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have
sold from 1997 through 2004 we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate
annual revenues in excess of 2 billion as part of these transactions we
retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these
businesses such as lawsuits product liability claims and potential claims by
buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were
inaccurate the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse
effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we can not
be certain that this favorable pattern will continue

       our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential
future benefits from new productivity initiatives in addition to the real
estate consolidations and costsaving initiatives that we have pursued over the
past three years we are instituting practical process improvement ppi
programs at our locations to further enhance our productivity efficiency and
customer satisfaction while we anticipate continued benefits from these ppi
initiatives as well as our continuing sourcing activities future benefits are
expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve

       our branding strategy could be unsuccessful we historically operated our
business largely as autonomous unaffiliated companies and as a result each of
our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names our
marketing and branding strategy transitions multiple unrelated brands to one
brand thermo electron several of our former brands such as finnigan and
nicolet commanded strong market recognition and customer loyalty we believe the
transition to the one brand enhances and strengthens our collective brand image
and brand awareness across the entire company our success in promoting our
brand depends on many factors including effective communication of the
transition to our customers acceptance and recognition by customers of this
brand and successful execution of the branding campaign by our marketing and
sales teams if we are not successful with this strategy we may experience
erosion in our product recognition brand image and customer loyalty and a
decrease in demand for our products

       it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving
internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or
declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a
number of strategies to improve our internal growth including

          finding new markets for our products

          developing new applications for our technologies

          combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to
           compete more effectively

          allocating research and development funding to products with higher
           growth prospects

          continuing key customer initiatives




                           thermo electron corporation


          expanding our service offerings

          strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets and

          continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to
           increase and support crossselling opportunities of products and
           services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings

       we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these
strategies may not result in the growth of our business

       as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results
of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our
revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international
markets in 2004 our international revenues from continuing operations
including export revenues from the united states accounted for approximately
60 of our total revenues the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk
that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and
the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in
international markets where payment for our products and services is made in
the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally
invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they
primarily do business the functional currency movements in the invoiced
currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash
flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in
nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us
dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate
movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in
fiscal 2004 and 2003 currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of
our continuing operations of 921 million and 1168 million respectively due
to weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the
company sells products and services a strengthening of the us dollar would
unfavorably affect revenues

       our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or
successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material
adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition
of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products
and services promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for
a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers and the need
for regulatory including antitrust approvals we may not be able to identify
and successfully complete transactions any acquisition we may complete may be
made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the
acquired company further we may not be able to integrate any acquired
businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses
profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these
acquisitions which could adversely affect our business

       moreover we previously acquired several companies and businesses as a
result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill on our balance
sheet which amounts to approximately 151 billion as of december 31 2004 we
assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well
as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be
impaired these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a
significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset
our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash
flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well
we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of
the goodwill we may be required to incur material charges relating to the
impairment of those assets

item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

       the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates
currency exchange rates and equity prices which could affect its future
results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure
to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities
additionally the company uses shortterm forward contracts to manage certain
exposures to currencies the company enters into forward currencyexchange
contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies
other than its subsidiaries local currencies the company does not engage in
extensive currency hedging activities however the purpose of the companys
currency hedging activities is to protect the companys local currency cash
flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates
the companys forward currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions
denominated in us dollars euros british pounds sterling and swiss francs
income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to
losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged the
company does not enter into speculative currency agreements

interest rates

       certain of the companys shortterm availableforsale investments and
longterm obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates interest rate
changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial
instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate
at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument a 10 decrease
in yearend 2004 and 2003 market interest rates would result in a negative
impact to the company of 5 million and 1 million respectively on the net
fair value of its interestsensitive financial instruments

       in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the
companys interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments a
100basispoint increase in 90day libor at december 31 2004 and 2003 would
increase the companys annual pretax interest expense by 1 million

currency exchange rates

       the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a
functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as longterm
the companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the
companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros
british pounds sterling and japanese yen the effect of a change in currency
exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is
reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of
shareholders equity a 10 depreciation in yearend 2004 and 2003 functional
currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of
shareholders equity of 106 million and 89 million respectively

       the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to
changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange
contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon
termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange
rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2004 and 2003 currency exchange rates
related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized
loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 59 million and 69 million
respectively the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange
contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to
approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged

       certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive
to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related
yearend 2004 and 2003 currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact
of 36 million and 21 million respectively on the companys net income

equity prices

       the companys availableforsale investment portfolio includes equity
securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price in addition the
companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of
the companys common stock changes in equity prices would result in changes in
the fair value of the companys availableforsale investments and convertible
obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the

general development of business

       thermo electron corporation also referred to in this document as thermo
electron we the company or the registrant is a world leader in
hightech instruments the company helps life science laboratory and
industrial customers advance scientific knowledge enable drug discovery
improve manufacturing processes and protect people and the environment with
instruments scientific equipment services and software solutions the
companys powerful technologies help researchers make discoveries that will
fight disease or prolong life they automatically monitor and control online
production to ensure the quality and safety of raw materials as well as the end
products and they are critical components embedded as enabling technologies
within scientific and industrial devices

       in the late 1980s thermo electron adopted a strategy of spinning out
certain businesses into separate public subsidiaries in which we kept a majority
ownership by 1997 we had spun out 22 public entities serving many diverse
markets to simplify our structure we announced in january 2000 a major
reorganization that ultimately resulted in taking private all of our public
subsidiaries selling noncore businesses and spinning off our paper recycling
and medical products businesses as part of the reorganization we divested of
businesses with aggregate annual revenues of approximately 2 billion this
reorganization was substantially completed in february 2002 when we took
private spectraphysics inc our last publicly traded subsidiary the
businesses spun off and sold as part of our reorganization have been accounted
for as discontinued operations see business segments and products the
companys continuing operations are comprised solely of its instrument
businesses during the first quarter of 2003 the company sold its last
remaining business in discontinued operations except where indicated the
information presented in this report pertains to our continuing operations

       our strategy going forward is to focus on internal growth by pursuing
developments in the markets that we serve that have potential for high growth
our strategy is also to continue to improve productivity enabling us to better
serve our customers with improved products technologies and complete
integrated systems and services in addition we plan to augment that growth
with strategic acquisitions that expand the reach of our technology by either
rounding out our product lines or bringing them to new markets

business segments and products

       we report our business in three principal segments life and laboratory
sciences measurement and control and optical technologies

       during 2003 the company transferred management responsibility and the
related financial reporting and monitoring for several small business units
between segments as follows 1 the compositionalmetrology business was moved
to the life and laboratory sciences segment from the optical technologies
segment 2 the ultrahighvacuum systems and semiconductortesting businesses
were moved to the measurement and control segment from the optical technologies
segment and 3 the organic elemental analysis business was moved to the life
and laboratory sciences segment from the measurement and control segment the
company has historically moved a business unit between segments when a shift in
strategic focus of either the business unit or a segment more closely aligns the
business unit with a segment different than that in which it had previously been
reported priorperiod segment information has been conformed to reflect these
changes

life and laboratory sciences

       we serve the pharmaceutical biotechnology academic and other research
and industrial laboratory markets as well as the clinical laboratory and
healthcare industries through our life and laboratory sciences segment during
2003 this segment was organized as four divisions bioscience technologies
scientific instruments informatics and services and clinical diagnostics

       bioscience technologies encompasses a broad range of instruments
consumables and robotic systems such as microplatebased handling and reading
equipment polymerase chain reaction pcr thermal cyclers for deoxyribonucleic
acid dna amplification magnetic particlebased molecular separation
instruments laboratory automation software and instruments and single
nucleotide polymorphism snp scoring systems consumables include reagents
microtiter plates liquidhandling pipettes and pipette tips robotic systems
include individual microplate movers and other instrumentation combined with
sophisticated integration software to produce applicationspecific workstations
these products are used primarily by pharmaceutical companies for drug discovery
and development testing and quality control and by biotechnology companies
and universities for life science research to help fight disease and prolong
life these products are typically used on the front end of multiinstrument
systems to prepare and handle samples prior to the samples being loaded into
other advanced instruments

       this division also includes a range of scientific equipment used for the
preparation and preservation of chemical and biological samples principally in
research settings for pharmaceutical academic and government customers the
divisions products are also used to capture and preserve samples in clinical
laboratories and blood banks products include cell culture incubators
ultralowtemperature freezers a full range of centrifuges from
microcentrifuges to floor models centrifugal vacuum concentrators biological
safety cabinets cryopreservation storage tanks laboratory freezedryers
baths and ovens

       on december 31 2003 we broadened our sample preparation business with
the acquisition of jouan sa jouan headquartered in france is a global
supplier of instruments and equipment used primarily by life science researchers
in academic pharmaceutical biotech and clinical markets to prepare and
preserve samples jouan products include a broad range of centrifuges laminar
flow and safety cabinets ultralow freezers and incubators jouan had revenues
of approximately 94 million in 2003 having completed the acquisition of jouan
at the close of business on the last day of the companys fiscal year jouans
results of operations for 2003 have not been included in the companys results

       scientific instruments brings together the companys core offering of
instrumentation for laboratory and industrial settings along with the
automation accessories consumables software spectral reference databases
and services to provide a complete solution

       in the life sciences arena we offer ion trap quadrupole and hybrid
mass spectrometers mss liquid chromatographs lcs and columns and
hyphenated multiinstrument combinations of these products as integrated
solutions lcms these systems are tailored to meet the rigorous demands of
lab professionals in applications such as drug discovery life science research
and analytical quantitation




       a significant and growing application for these instruments is
proteomics the study of proteins most drugs  about 90 percent  interact with
proteins so multiinstrument systems that can rapidly identify and quantify
proteins are of increasing value to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers
we continue to introduce new systems that address the breadth of primary
analytical needs for highthroughput analysis and proteomics research the
sensitivity of our finnigan ltq ion trap and the power of our finnigan ltq ft
hybrid ms are being used to improve protein detection and our sequest software
provides higher sensitivity and accuracy for protein identification

       beyond the life sciences market our chemical analysis instrumentation
uses various optical techniques to determine the elemental and molecular
composition of a wide range of complex liquids and solids we manufacture gas
chromatography gc gc mass spectrometry gcms combustion analysis atomic
absorption aa inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometer icpms fourier

also develop stateoftheart advanced instrumentation including magnetic
sector ms auger and xray photoelectron spectroscopy systems customers
include environmental pharmaceutical polymer petrochemical food
semiconductor energy coatings geological steel and basic material
producers who frequently use these instruments for quality assurance and
quality control applications primarily in a laboratory

       informatics and services offers laboratory information management systems
lims chromatography data systems analytical data archival and instrument
integration solutions to customers in regulated and nonregulated industries such

discontinued operations

       as a result of our january 2000 reorganization plan a number of
businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations businesses in
this category included kadant inc a supplier of systems to the papermaking and
paper recycling industry as well as fiberbased consumer products and viasys
healthcare inc a manufacturer of a range of medical products for diagnosis




and monitoring kadant was spun off to shareholders in august 2001 and viasys
was spun off in november 2001 these businesses together with a number of

environment biomedical and emerging technologies and recycling and resource
recovery segments during the first quarter of 2003 the company sold its last
remaining business in discontinued operations the company has retained some
lease liabilities as well as responsibility for several litigation matters
related to discontinued operations

new products and research and development

       our business includes the development and introduction of new products
and may include entry into new business segments we are not currently committed
to any new products that require the investment of a material amount of our
assets nor do we have any definitive plans to enter new businesses that would
require such an investment

       during 2003 2002 and 2001 we spent 1464 million 1551 million and
1716 million respectively on research and development

raw materials

       our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of
raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do
not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our
business

patents licenses and trademarks

       patents are important in each segment of our business no particular
patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss
would significantly affect our operations as a whole generally we seek patent
protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and
incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of
interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not
always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or
contracts

       we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where
appropriate we use trademarks or register our products we also enter into
license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and
knowhow

seasonal influences

       revenues in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in
the other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial
pharmaceutical and government customers

working capital requirements

       there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to
customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital

dependency on a single customer

       there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material
adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 10 of our
total revenues in any of the past three years





backlog

       our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2003 and 2002 was as follows

       we believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2003 will be
filled during 2004 year over year changes in backlog are affected by currency
translation acquisitions and divestitures among other factors

government contracts

       although the company transacts business with various government agencies
no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or
termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have
a material adverse effect on the companys financial results

overview of results of operations and liquidity

       the company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are
sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by
developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic
acquisitions of complementary businesses during 2000 and 2001 the company
carried out the principal aspects of a major reorganization plan under which it
sold or spun off many noncore businesses as a result of these actions the
companys continuing operations are comprised solely of its instrument
businesses the businesses that have been spun off and sold have been presented
as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements the
companys continuing operations fall into three principal business segments
life and laboratory sciences measurement and control and optical technologies
the company has historically moved a business unit between segments when a shift
in strategic focus of either the business unit or a segment more closely aligns
the business unit with a segment different than that in which it had previously
been reported

       the companys revenues grew nominally in 2003 the strengthening of
nonus currencies relative to the dollar caused an increase in reported
revenues offset by lower demand in several businesses in the companys
measurement and control and optical technologies segments in addition to the
change in revenues caused by currency translation and divestitures net of
acquisitions which are discussed below sales decreased 5 in 2003 primarily
due to lower demand the company also reported this same percentage revenue
decrease in 2002 compared with 2001 the most recent year in which the company
reported positive comparative sales growth was 2001 compared with 2000 the
trend of lower sales has resulted primarily from a slowdown in the worldwide
economy that has adversely affected capital spending across most markets
addressed by the company fourth quarter 2003 results suggest the trend of lower
sales is reversing for example the life and laboratory sciences segment
reported higher fourth quarter sales over the year ago quarter while the
optical technologies segment had sequential sales growth over the third quarter
and increased its backlog 11 in the quarter the measurement and control
segment increased its backlog at yearend 2003 by 3 over that of a year ago




       the companys strategy over time is to augment internal growth at
existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in
2003 these acquisitions included jouan sa a manufacturer of products used to
prepare and preserve laboratory samples which was acquired on december 31
2003 laboratory management services inc a supplier of regulatory instrument
and consulting services to the pharmaceutical and related industries and the
personal radiationdetection instruments product line from siemens plc

       in 2003 the companys operating income and operating income margin
improved to 1848 million and 88 respectively from 1555 million and 75
respectively in 2002 operating income margin is operating income divided by
revenues during the economic slowdown the company undertook actions to reduce
its cost structure and promote operating efficiency principally through
consolidating real estate locations and reducing related headcount the
annualized cost savings of actions initiated in 2003 and 2002 total
approximately 58 million as these actions were taken during periods of
declining revenues the corresponding income benefit was offset in part by the
effect on income of lower sales restructuring and other costs net reduced
pretax income by 488 million and 613 million in 2003 and 2002
respectively

       income from continuing operations declined to 1727 million in 2003
from 1944 million in 2002 the decrease resulted primarily from an 876
million pretax decrease in gains on sale of investments in 2003 the company
had a large equity interest in flir systems inc resulting from shares acquired
as part of an acquisition completed in 1999 the company sold shares of flir and
had significant gains in 2002 and to a lesser extent in 2003 as of the end of
2003 the company no longer owned shares of flir the 2003 investment gains also
included gains from the sale of shares of thoratec corporation as of the end of
2003 the company owned 57 million shares of thoratec with a fair market value
of 74 million the company obtained the shares of thoratec in 2001 as
consideration for a divestiture

       the company has reduced its effective tax rate over the past two years
in 2003 the tax rate was 210 which included some benefits discussed below
that the company does not expect to have in 2004 several initiatives however
will continue to provide a benefit in the future principally a reorganization
of the companys nonus subsidiary structure that has resulted in a more
taxefficient corporate structure the company expects its effective tax rate in
2004 will be approximately 28  29

       during 2003 the companys cash flow from operations totaled 2167
million compared with 1103 million in 2002 in 2002 cash of 852 million
was used to reduce other current liabilities including tax payments on
investment gains in 2003 a decrease in other current liabilities used cash of
75 million resulting in a year over year difference of 777 million in
addition decreases in accounts receivable and inventories in 2003 generated
203 million more cash than did decreases in these accounts in 2002

       during 2003 the company used cash of 6656 million for financing
activities principally the repayment of shortterm debt as well as the early
redemption of longterm obligations with the objective of reducing interest
costs as of yearend 2003 the companys outstanding debt totaled 2755
million of which 82 is due in 2007 and thereafter the company expects that
its existing cash and investments of 4182 million as of december 31 2003 and
its future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured
borrowings of up to 250 million under its revolving credit agreements are
sufficient to meet the capital requirements of its existing businesses for the
foreseeable future including at least the next 24 months

critical accounting policies

       the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and
results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires
the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates
including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets warranty
obligations income taxes pension costs contingencies and litigation
restructuring and sale of businesses the company bases its estimates on
historical experience current market and economic conditions and other




assumptions that management believes are reasonable the results of these
estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and
liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions

       the company believes the following represent its critical accounting
policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements

       a the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
           losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts
           due such allowances totaled 261 million at december 31 2003 the
           company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are
           uncollectible based on the age of the receivable the
           creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is
           relevant to the judgment if the financial condition of the companys
           customers were to deteriorate reducing their ability to make
           payments additional allowances would be required

       b the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence
           for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value
           based on usage in the preceding 12 months expected demand and any
           other information that is relevant to the judgment if ultimate usage
           or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand
           additional writedowns may be required

       c the company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using
           market comparables for similar businesses or forecasts of discounted
           future cash flows goodwill totaled 16 billion at december 31
           2003 estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to
           revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures
           working capital levels and other factors different assumptions from
           those made in the companys analysis could materially affect
           projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill for
           impairment should the fair value of the companys goodwill decline
           because of reduced operating performance market declines or other
           indicators of impairment charges for impairment of goodwill may be
           necessary

       d the company reviews other longlived assets for impairment when
           indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant
           reduction in cash flows associated with the assets other longlived
           assets totaled 4365 million at december 31 2003 including 3007
           million of fixed assets in testing a longlived asset for
           impairment assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows
           associated with the asset estimates of future cash flows require
           assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and
           assetrelated expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed
           for impairment should future cash flows decline significantly from
           estimated amounts charges for impairment of other longlived assets
           may be necessary

       e in instances where the company sells equipment with a related
           installation obligation the company generally recognizes revenue
           related to the equipment when title passes the company recognizes
           revenue related to the installation when it performs the
           installation the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the
           installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale
           should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation
           change the companys revenue recognition would be affected

       f in instances where the company sells equipment with customer
           specified acceptance criteria the company must assess whether it can
           demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the
           customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue
           recognition if the nature of customerspecified acceptance criteria
           were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not
           demonstrate adherence the company would be required to defer
           additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of
           customer acceptance testing

       g at the time the company recognizes revenue it provides for the
           estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical
           experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that
           indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns
           the liability for warranty obligations totaled 296 million at
           december 31 2003 should product failure rates or the actual cost of
           correcting product failures vary from estimates revisions to the
           estimated warranty liability would be necessary




       h the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss
           carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected
           profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance
           for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more
           likely than not go unused if it becomes more likely than not that a
           tax asset or loss carryforward will be used the company reverses the
           related valuation allowance the companys tax valuation allowance
           totaled 753 million at december 31 2003 should the companys
           actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates
           additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary

       i the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in
           the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates accrued income
           taxes totaled 1002 million at december 31 2003 should tax return
           positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained
           upon audit the company could be required to record an incremental
           tax provision for such taxes should disputed positions that are
           reserved ultimately be sustained the company would recognize an
           incremental tax benefit

       j the company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation and
           provides a reserve for these losses should the ultimate losses on
           contingencies and litigation vary from estimates adjustments to
           those reserves may be required

       k one of the companys us subsidiaries and several nonus
           subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans major assumptions
           used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the
           discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of increase
           in employee compensation levels assumptions are determined based on
           company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with
           the companys actuaries and are evaluated each year as of the plans
           measurement date net periodic pension costs for defined benefit
           plans totaled 75 million in 2003 should any of these assumptions
           change they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs

       l the company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating
           facilities based on future lease obligations and expected subrental
           income the companys accrued restructuring costs for abandoned
           facilities totaled 147 million at december 31 2003 should actual
           cash flows associated with subrental income from vacated facilities
           vary from estimated amounts adjustments may be required

       m the company estimates the expected proceeds from any businesses held
           for sale and when necessary records losses to reduce the carrying
           value of these businesses to estimated realizable value should the
           actual or estimated proceeds which would include postclosing
           purchase price adjustments vary from current estimates results
           could differ from expected amounts

results of operations

2003 compared with 2002

continuing operations

       sales in 2003 were 2097 billion an increase of 108 million from
2002 the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in
revenues of 1208 million in 2003 sales decreased 106 million due to
divestitures net of acquisitions in addition to the changes in revenue
resulting from currency translation acquisitions and divestitures revenues
decreased 994 million or 5 primarily due to lower demand as described by
segment below

       operating income was 1848 million in 2003 compared with 1555 million
in 2002 operating income margin increased to 88 in 2003 from 75 in 2002
operating income in 2003 was reduced by additional charges associated with
restructuring actions initiated in 2003 restructuring plans initiated prior to
2003 and certain other costs net note 15 operating income in 2002 was
reduced by charges associated with restructuring plans initiated during 2002 and
2001 and certain other costs net the restructuring and other items totaled
488 million and 613 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively and are
discussed by segment below operating income increased primarily due to a lower
cost base following recent restructuring actions among the other actions
contributing to a lower cost base is lower spending on research and development
activities which decreased 6 to 1464 million in 2003 as the company focuses
on those projects with the highest estimated returns the company expects to
continue spending on research and development at a rate of approximately 7 of
revenues

       in response to a continued downturn in markets served by the company and
in connection with the companys overall reorganization restructuring actions
were initiated in 2003 in a number of business units to reduce costs and
redundancies principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of
facilities these actions resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in mid
to late 2003 and continuing in early 2004 of approximately 15 million
including 7 million in the life and laboratory sciences segment 4 million in
the measurement and control segment and 4 million in the optical technologies
segment the company expects to incur an additional 3 million of restructuring
costs primarily in 2004 for charges associated with these actions that cannot
be recorded until incurred the company believes that restructuring actions
undertaken in 2003 will be substantially completed in 2004 the company does not
currently expect to undertake significant restructuring actions in 2004

       in november 2002 the emerging issues task force eitf reached a
consensus on eitf no 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple
deliverables the company began applying the consensus prospectively in the
first quarter of 2003 under eitf no 0021 the company recognizes revenue and
related costs for arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables
such as equipment and installation as each element is delivered or completed
based on its fair value when a portion of the customers payment is not due
until installation the company defers that portion of the revenue until
completion of installation prior to 2003 the company followed staff accounting
bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements adopted
in 2000 for multiple element arrangements under sab no 101 revenue was
recognized at shipment with the estimated cost of installation accrued for most
products requiring installation for those products requiring installations of
longer duration the company previously deferred revenue until completion of
installation the adoption of eitf no 0021 increased revenues and diluted
earnings per share by 76 million and 01 respectively during the first
quarter of 2003 where eitf no 0021 has had an impact the company has
disclosed such impact

       sales in the life and laboratory sciences segment increased 872
million or 7 to 1291 billion in 2003 the favorable effects of currency
translation resulted in an increase in revenues of 863 million in 2003 sales
decreased 97 million due to product line divestitures net of acquisitions in
addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation
divestitures and acquisitions revenues increased 106 million or 09
including 05 from the effect of the adoption of eitf no 0021 a 148
million increase in sales of clinical diagnostic products was offset in part by
decreased sales of bioscience instrumentation principally due to a downturn in
demand from pharmaceutical and industrial markets the increase in sales of
clinical diagnostic products resulted primarily from higher demand for rapid
diagnostic tests during a harsh flu season in the united states and to a lesser
extent increased demand for a newly released tissue processor used in
anatomical pathology laboratories




       operating income margin decreased to 141 in 2003 from 144 in 2002
operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs net of
218 million and 192 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively in addition to
the increase in restructuring and other costs in 2003 the decrease in operating
income margin resulted from higher marketing and selling expenses due to several
key commercial initiatives the segments commercial initiatives include key
customer account management increased advertising costs for a branding
transition and establishment of customer call centers and product demonstration
facilities these cost increases were offset in part by cost savings from
facility consolidations and related productivity measures the cost reduction
measures in 2002 and 2003 reduced the segments cost base by an aggregate of
approximately 14 million on an annualized basis

       in 2003 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of
218 million including 188 million of cash costs primarily for severance
abandoned facilities employee retention and relocation expenses at businesses
being consolidated in addition the segment recorded net charges of 34
million to write down the carrying value of fixed assets primarily buildings
held for sale to expected disposal value offset by 04 million of net gains
primarily from the sale of a product line in 2002 the segment recorded
restructuring and other costs net of 192 million including 122 million of
cash costs primarily for severance abandoned facilities and employee
retention at businesses being consolidated the segment also recorded charges to
cost of revenues of 13 million primarily for the sale of inventories revalued
at the date of acquisition in addition the segment realized a net loss of 43
million on the sale of assets principally its dynex automated diagnostics
product line and wrote down 14 million of fixed assets at abandoned

       sales in the measurement and control segment decreased 298 million or
5 to 6062 million in 2003 the favorable effects of currency translation
resulted in an increase in revenues of 301 million in 2003 sales increased
33 million due to acquisitions net of divestitures in addition to the
changes in revenue resulting from currency translation acquisitions and
divestitures revenues decreased 632 million or 10 of this amount 268
million or 4 was due to the inclusion in the fourth quarter of 2002 of a
shipment of explosivesdetection equipment to the us transportation security
administration following a congressional mandate to screen all checked airline
baggage in the united states by the end of 2002 the balance of the decrease was
primarily the result of weaker demand arising from economic conditions facing
customers particularly in the process instruments businesses where
approximately 60 of the remaining decrease occurred process instruments are
generally used in industrial markets such as minerals and mining and
petrochemical applications where capital expenditures have slowed in addition
a 7 decrease in sales of equipment used primarily in semiconductor applications
was offset in part by higher revenues from equipment used in homeland security

       operating income margin increased to 73 in 2003 from 72 in 2002
operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs net of
103 million and 136 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in
operating income margin resulted primarily from cost reduction measures
following restructuring actions in 2002 and 2003 and to a lesser extent 33
million of lower restructuring and other costs net offset in part by the
effect on operating margin of lower revenues the cost reduction measures in
2002 and 2003 reduced the segments cost base by an aggregate of approximately
17 million on an annualized basis




       the company completed its annual analysis of the segments goodwill in
december 2003 and determined that no impairment existed several of the
segments businesses are cyclical and their results follow closely the business
trends of industries such as semiconductor and oil and gas which have slowed
capital spending since 2001 although recent industry and internal indicators
such as yearend backlog growth in the segment of 3 over 2002 suggest the
downturn may be reversing were the downward year over year sales trend of 2001
to 2003 to continue for an extended period of time the segments goodwill may
become impaired the segments goodwill totaled 414 million at the end of 2003

       in 2003 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of
103 million including cash costs of 103 million principally for severance
abandoned facilities employee retention and relocation expenses at businesses
being consolidated in addition the segment recorded charges of 20 million
primarily for the writedown of goodwill in the test and measurement business to
reduce the carrying value to disposal value and for the writedown of assets at
facilities being consolidated offset by a gain of 21 million on the sale of a
building the segment also recorded charges to cost of revenues of 01 million
primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition in
2002 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of 136 million
including 204 million of cash costs principally for severance abandoned
facilities and employee retention in addition the segment recorded 87
million of net gains primarily from the sale of its thermo blh and thermo nobel
subsidiaries which were noncore businesses held for sale since 2001 in 2002

       sales in the optical technologies segment decreased 469 million or
18 to 2118 million in 2003 the favorable effects of currency translation
resulted in an increase in revenues of 44 million in 2003 sales decreased
42 million as a result of two product line divestitures in addition to the
changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and divestitures
revenues decreased 471 million or 19 primarily due to weaker demand the
weaker demand was principally the result of the severe slowdown in the
semiconductor and other industrial markets that has adversely affected customers
in the segments businesses these industries are highly cyclical and have
experienced downturns that began in 2001 research funding for the scientific
laser market has also remained slow and this together with the downturn in
industrial markets has heightened competition in sales to academic and research
customers

       operating income margin was negative 55 in 2003 compared with negative
120 in 2002 operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other
costs net of 116 million and 259 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively
the decrease in the segments operating loss was principally due to cost
reduction and productivity measures undertaken in 2002 and 2003 the suspension
of telecommunications activities in the second quarter of 2002 and to a lesser
extent lower restructuring and other costs these were offset in part by the
impact of lower revenues the cost reduction measures in 2002 and 2003 reduced
the segments cost base by an aggregate of approximately 27 million on an
annualized basis

       the company completed its annual analysis of the segments goodwill in
december 2003 and determined that no impairment existed the segments
businesses are cyclical and their results follow closely the business trends of
industries such as semiconductor and other industrial markets that have slowed
capital spending since 2001 although recent industry and internal indicators
such as 9 sequential fourth quarter sales growth in the segment over the
preceding quarter suggest the downturn is reversing were the downward year
over year sales trend of 2001 to 2003 to continue for an extended period of
time the segments goodwill may become impaired the segments goodwill totaled
122 million at the end of 2003





       in 2003 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of
116 million including cash costs of 58 million principally for abandoned
facilities and severance and related costs for terminated employees these
charges were offset by a gain of 10 million for the reversal of contract
cancellation fees that were disputed and ultimately not required in addition
the segment recorded a charge of 48 million primarily for the writedown to
disposal value of a noncore product line that was sold in october 2003 the
segment also recorded charges of 20 million including the writedown of a
facility held for sale to estimated disposal value and abandoned assets net of
recoveries in 2002 the segment recorded restructuring and other costs net of
259 million including 97 million of cash costs principally for severance
and abandonedequipment leases associated with suspended telecom initiatives
the cash costs also included 07 million for the settlement of litigation in
addition this segment wrote off assets totaling 88 million primarily for
abandoned telecommunication and other manufacturing equipment this segment also
recorded a charge of 08 million resulting from employee options to purchase
shares of spectraphysics becoming options to purchase shares of thermo electron
following the acquisition of the minority interest in this business in february
2002 in 2002 the segment also recorded 65 million of charges to cost of
revenues for two discontinued product lines and a charge of 01 million for the
loss on the sale of a small business unit note 15

other income net

       the company reported other income net of 339 million and 1310
million in 2003 and 2002 respectively note 4 other income net includes
interest income interest expense gain on investments net equity in earnings
of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items net interest income decreased
to 197 million in 2003 from 479 million in 2002 primarily due to lower
invested cash balances following the repurchase and redemption of company
securities and the payment of shortterm notes payable and to a lesser extent
lower prevailing interest rates interest expense decreased to 187 million in
2003 from 409 million in 2002 as a result of the redemption maturity and
repurchase of debentures as well as the full year effect of entering into
interestrate swap arrangements in the first quarter of 2002 offset in part by
interest on borrowings under securitieslending arrangements the company
expects that interest expense will exceed interest income in 2004 continuing
the trend of the second half of 2003

       during 2003 and 2002 the company had gains on investments net of 355
million and 1231 million respectively the gains included 163 million in
2003 from the sale of shares of thoratec and 137 million and 1114 million in
2003 and 2002 respectively from the sale of shares of flir the company
obtained common shares of thoratec as part of the sale of thermo cardiosystems
inc in 2001 note 16 and obtained an equity interest in flir as part of the
acquisition of spectraphysics ab in 1999 of the total gain from the sale of
flir shares 39 million and 310 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively
represent a recovery of amounts written down in prior years when the company
deemed an impairment of its investment in flir to be other than temporary the
company recorded income from equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries
of 25 million in 2002 primarily related to the investment in flir effective
march 30 2002 following a reduction in the companys percentage ownership of
flir to less then 20 the company no longer reported its prorata share of flir
earnings but instead accounted for its remaining investment as an
availableforsale security note 4 in addition the company repurchased and
redeemed debentures resulting in charges of 10 million and 15 million
during 2003 and 2002 respectively

provision for income taxes

       the companys effective tax rate was 210 and 323 in 2003 and 2002
respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2003 primarily due to 90
million of tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance due to
expected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards note 6 and 37
million of tax benefit from the sale of a business these tax benefits reduced
the companys 2003 effective tax rate by 58 the decrease was also due in part
to the fullyear impact on the 2003 effective tax rate of a reorganization
throughout 2002 of the companys subsidiaries in several european countries that
resulted in a more taxefficient corporate structure and a decrease in 2003 of
gains from the sale of investment securities in addition the company reduced
its effective tax rate by 18 in 2003 through repatriation of cash from
nonus subsidiaries which resulted in foreign tax credits the company
expects its effective tax rate in 2004 will be approximately 28  29




       in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are
examined by various tax authorities including the internal revenue service
irs the irs has concluded its field examination for the tax years 1997
through 2000 as part of its routine examinations of the companys income tax
returns at the conclusion of the field examination several issues were
unresolved and are currently being reviewed at the appeals office of the irs in
2004 the company expects to resolve the disputed issues and complete the
examination although the outcome of these matters cannot presently be
determined management believes that it may reach favorable settlement of the
examinations upon completion of the appellate review by the irs unfavorable
settlement of any particular issue would require use of cash favorable
resolution would result in a reduction to the companys effective tax rate in
the quarter of resolution any additional impact on the companys liability for
income taxes cannot presently be determined however the company believes its
accrued income tax liabilities are adequate

contingent liabilities

       at yearend 2003 the company was contingently liable with respect to
certain lawsuits an unfavorable outcome in the matter described in note 11
could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results
of operations and cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period

income from continuing operations

       income from continuing operations was 1727 million in 2003 compared
with 1944 million in 2002 results in both periods were affected by
restructuring gains on the sale of thoratec and flir shares and other items
discussed above

recent accounting pronouncements

       several recent accounting pronouncements may affect the companys
financial statements in the future these rule changes are summarized in note 1

       the company announced its intention to begin recording the effect of
stock options in its consolidated statement of operations in 2005 when final
financial accounting standards board rules are expected to become effective

discontinued operations

       the company had aftertax gains of 273 million in 2003 and 1154
million in 2002 from the disposal of discontinued operations the 2003 gain
consists of two pretax components and two tax components in 2003 the company
resolved several disputes and related claims that it had retained following the
sale of businesses in its discontinued operations in connection with the
resolution of these matters on favorable terms relative to the damages estimated
and amount of established reserves as well as the settlement of lease
obligations the companys pretax gain recorded in prior years on disposal of
the related businesses increased by 271 million in 2003 the company also
sold the last remaining business in discontinued operations peter brotherhood
ltd and received additional proceeds associated with businesses sold prior to
2003 including postclosing purchase price adjustments the company recorded
pretax gains from the disposal of discontinued operations of 83 million
substantially as a result of these transactions the company recorded a tax
provision of 132 million on the above gains and realized 51 million of
additional tax benefits from the disposal of businesses sold prior to 2003
principally foreign tax credits

       during 2002 primarily as a result of new tax regulations concerning
deductible losses from divested businesses the company revised its estimate of
the tax consequences of business disposals in discontinued operations and
recorded a tax benefit of 466 million in addition in 2002 the company sold
its trophy radiologie business for approximately 51 million in cash and
principally as a result of this transaction recorded an aftertax gain of 174
million also the company sold the last remaining component of its former
powergeneration business in 2002 and realized a gain from the disposition
totaling 130 million primarily for previously unrecognized tax benefits that
were realized upon the sale




       in february 2001 the company sold its interest in thermo cardiosystems
to thoratec in exchange for 193 million shares of thoratec common stock
certain restrictions which lapsed in august 2002 limited the timing of the
companys ability to sell these shares the company recorded an aftertax charge
of 660 million in the first quarter of 2001 for a decline in market value of
thoratec common stock as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations
following a sale of shares in february 2002 for net proceeds of 104 million and
an aftertax gain of 384 million the company owned less than 20 of
thoratecs outstanding shares and began accounting for its investment as an
availableforsale security in continuing operations in the first quarter of
2002 with unrealized gains or losses recorded as part of accumulated other
comprehensive items in the accompanying balance sheet note 16

       operating income was 1555 million in 2002 compared with 342 million
in 2001 operating income margin increased to 75 in 2002 from 16 in 2001
operating income in 2002 was reduced by additional charges associated with
restructuring plans initiated during the fourth quarter of 2001 other
restructuring actions initiated in 2002 and certain other costs net note 15
operating income in 2001 was reduced by charges associated with restructuring
plans initiated during 2001 and certain other costs net the restructuring and
other items totaled 613 million and 1588 million in 2002 and 2001
respectively and are discussed by segment below and in more detail in note 15
the 2001 period also included 402 million of goodwill amortization
amortization of goodwill ceased following the adoption of statement of financial
accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets
effective in 2002 note 1 operating income increased primarily due to lower
restructuring and other costs net in 2002 the amortization of goodwill in
2001 and a lower cost base following recent restructuring actions offset by
lower revenues and the resulting reduced profitability at a number of
businesses discussed below among the factors contributing to a lower cost base
was lower spending for selling general and administrative expenses which
decreased 9 to 5647 million in 2002 primarily due to cost reduction measures
including facility consolidations in addition spending on research and
development activities declined 10 to 1551 million in 2002 as the company
focused its spending on those projects with the highest estimated returns




       in response to a continued downturn in semiconductor and other industrial
markets served by the company and in an effort to further integrate business
units and reduce the number of real estate locations the company continued
restructuring initiatives in 2002 at a number of business units the
restructuring and related actions primarily consisted of headcount reductions
writedowns of production equipment and abandonment of leases for
telecommunications products and consolidation of facilities to streamline
operations and reduce costs these actions resulted in annual cost reductions
beginning in late 2002 and continuing in early 2003 of approximately 43
million including 7 million in the life and laboratory sciences segment 13
million in the measurement and control segment and 23 million in the optical
technologies segment

       sales in the life and laboratory sciences segment increased 312 million
to 1204 billion in 2002 the favorable effects of currency translation
resulted in an increase in revenues of 231 million in 2002 sales increased
26 million due to acquisitions net of divestitures in addition to the
changes in revenue resulting from currency translation acquisitions and
divestitures revenues grew nominally increasing 55 million or 05
increased demand for highend technology mass spectrometry equipment and
histology and cytology products was offset in part by weakened demand for
spectroscopy instruments and samplepreparation products that had
midsingledigit percentage declines in sales primarily due to lower capital
spending the company believes that many pharmaceutical customers for example
were delaying purchases except for highend equipment where recent technological
advances may provide a competitive advantage

       operating income margin increased to 144 in 2002 from 86 in 2001
operating income margin was affected by goodwill amortization of 263 million
in 2001 goodwill amortization was discontinued in 2002 as a result of the
adoption of sfas no 142 operating income margin was also affected by
restructuring and other costs net of 192 million and 479 million in 2002
and 2001 respectively the increase in operating income margin resulted
primarily from lower restructuring and other costs the discontinuance of
goodwill amortization in 2002 cost reduction and productivity measures
undertaken in 2001 and 2002 and to a lesser extent revenue growth of
highermargin products

       sales in the measurement and control segment decreased 691 million or
10 to 6360 million in 2002 sales decreased 294 million due to
divestitures net of acquisitions the favorable effects of currency translation
resulted in an increase in revenues of 83 million in 2002 in addition to the
changes in revenue resulting from divestitures acquisitions and currency
translation revenues decreased 480 million or 7 primarily due to weaker
demand the decrease was due to a decline in revenues in each of the segments
principal businesses particularly the control technologies business where over
half of the decrease occurred the weaker demand was primarily due to economic
conditions facing customers particularly in the semiconductor energy and
steel industries the decrease in revenues was offset in part by a 268 million
sale of explosivesdetection equipment in the fourth quarter of 2002 following a
congressional mandate to begin screening all checked airline baggage in the
united states by the end of 2002

       the principal divestitures by the segment included the july 2002 sale of
thermo blh and thermo nobel which manufacture and sell straingauges and were

unit which manufactures and sells marinenavigation equipment the april 2001
sale of the cac and mid south businesses which provide the oil and gas industry
with wellhead safety and control products and the july 2001 sale of its

       sales in the optical technologies segment decreased 652 million or
20 to 2586 million in 2002 the unfavorable effects of currency translation
resulted in a decrease in revenues of 27 million in 2002 sales decreased 25
million due to divestitures in addition to the changes in revenue resulting
from currency translation and divestitures revenues decreased 600 million or
19 primarily due to weaker demand the weaker demand was due to a severe
slowdown in the semiconductor and other industrial markets that has adversely
affected all of the segments principal businesses

       in the third quarter of 2002 following the companys acquisition of the
remaining minority interest in spectraphysics the company conformed this
divisions backlog policy to the prevailing practice at the companys other
businesses of including in backlog only product orders that are expected to ship
within six months spectraphysics historical practice had been to include
orders expected to ship within 12 months this change resulted in a reduction of
backlog of 393 million excluding the effect of this change the segments
backlog decreased 40 during 2002 and totaled 558 million as of december 28
2002

       operating income margin was negative 120 in 2002 compared with

affected by restructuring and other costs net of 259 million and 533
million in 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in operating income margin
resulted primarily from lower restructuring and other costs the discontinuance
of goodwill amortization in 2002 and the effect of cost reduction and
productivity measures undertaken in 2001 and 2002 offset in part by lower
revenues at each of the segments principal businesses particularly the lasers
business

       in 2002 the segment recorded restructuring and other charges net of
259 million including 97 million of cash costs principally for severance
and abandonedequipment leases associated with suspended telecom initiatives

million in 2002 and 2001 respectively note 4 interest income decreased to
479 million in 2002 from 685 million in 2001 primarily due to lower
invested cash balances following the repurchase and redemption of company
securities acquisitions and to a lesser extent lower prevailing interest
rates interest expense decreased to 409 million in 2002 from 718 million in
2001 as a result of the redemption maturity and repurchase of debentures as
well as entering into interestrate swap arrangements offset in part by
interest on borrowings under securitieslending arrangements note 10




       during 2002 and 2001 the company had gains on investments net of
1231 million and 356 million respectively the gains included 1114

provision for income taxes

       the companys effective tax rate was 323 and 381 in 2002 and 2001
respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2002 primarily due to the
absence of nondeductible goodwill amortization following the adoption of sfas
no 142 and to a lesser extent a reorganization of the companys subsidiaries
in several european countries that resulted in a more taxefficient corporate
structure the effective tax rate exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate
in 2001 due to the impact of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses
which included goodwill amortization

minority interest income

       minority interest income of 03 million and 58 million in 2002 and
2001 respectively represents minority shareholders allocable share of losses

interest in this subsidiary in february 2002 note 16

income from continuing operations

       income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle was 1944 million in 2002 compared with 507 million in
2001 results in both periods were affected by restructuring gains on the sale
of flir shares and other items discussed above results were also affected by
the absence of goodwill in 2002

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

its trophy radiologie business for approximately 51 million in cash and
principally as a result of this transaction recorded an aftertax gain of 174
million also the company sold the last remaining component of its former
powergeneration business in 2002 and realized a gain from the disposition
totaling 130 million primarily for previously unrecognized tax benefits that
were realized upon the sale

       in february 2001 the company sold its interest in thermo cardiosystems
to thoratec in exchange for 193 million shares of thoratec common stock
certain restrictions which lapsed in august 2002 limited the timing of the
companys ability to sell these shares the company recorded an aftertax charge
of 660 million in the first quarter of 2001 for a decline in market value of
thoratec common stock as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations




following a sale of shares in february 2002 for net proceeds of 104 million and
an aftertax gain of 384 million the company owned less than 20 of
thoratecs outstanding shares and began accounting for its investment as an
availableforsale security in continuing operations in the first quarter of

       this table excludes 803 million of other longterm liabilities
principally pension liabilities and 116 million of deferred income taxes as

       the company has no material commitments for purchases of property plant
and equipment but expects that for 2004 such expenditures will approximate 55
to 65 million

investments future cash flow from operations and available borrowings under
credit facilities are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of
its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next
24 months





forwardlooking statements

       in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995 we caution readers that the following important
factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could
affect our actual results and could cause our actual results in 2004 and beyond
to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made
by us

       we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant
technological change and respond to introductions of new products in order to
remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and
expenditures for product development we sell our products in several industries
that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes frequent
new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry
standards without the timely introduction of new products services and
enhancements our products and services will likely become technologically
obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would
suffer

       our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture
their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop
products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products if we
fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities we may
invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not
lead to significant revenue

       many of our existing products and those under development are
technologically innovative and require significant planning design
development and testing at the technological product and
manufacturingprocess levels these activities require us to make significant
investments

       products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological
change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of
new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies
uncompetitive or obsolete our competitors may adapt more quickly to new
technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can the products
that we are currently developing or those we will develop in the future may
not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace and our products
or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete

       we sell our products and services to a number of companies that operate
in cyclical industries which would adversely affect our results of operations
when those industries experience a downturn the growth and profitability of
some of our businesses depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to
cyclical downturns for example our optical technologies segment depends in
part on sales to the semiconductor industry and our measurement and control
segment depends in part on sales to the steel and cement industries slowdowns
in these industries would adversely affect sales by these segments which in
turn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations

       our business is impacted by general worldwide economic conditions and
related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate adverse economic
conditions worldwide could adversely impact our business in 2004 and beyond
resulting in

        reduced demand for some of our products

        increased rate of order cancellations or delays

        increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories

        increased pressure on the prices for our products and services and

        greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable




       changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or
increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers
must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as
environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop
configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those
regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our
products for example many of our instruments are marketed to the
pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in
the us food and drug administrations regulation of the drug discovery and
development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these
products

       demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of
our customers and on government funding policies our customers include
manufacturers of semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors
pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare
providers government agencies and public and private research institutions
many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources
and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital
spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a
significant effect on the demand for our products

       our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material
adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we
infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation
or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining
patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products
and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing
new products through the development process and into the marketplace our
success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain
and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in
other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file
additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products
patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by
or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be
sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or
licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights
under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition
competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign
countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased
market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits
brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against
others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely
affect our business and results of operations

       we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow which we seek to
protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our
collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets
may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors

       third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are
infringing on their intellectual property rights we could incur substantial
costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which
could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and
results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a
judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable
relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell
distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad
in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against
us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that
relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual
property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these
licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the
patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or
other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our
products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition and results of operations




       we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have
sold from 1997 through 2003 we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate
annual revenues in excess of 2 billion as part of these transactions we
retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these
businesses such as lawsuits product liability claims and potential claims by
buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were
inaccurate the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse
effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we can not
be certain that this favorable pattern will continue

       our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential
future benefits from new productivity initiatives in addition to the real
estate consolidations and costsaving initiatives that we have pursued over the
past three years we are instituting practical process improvement ppi
programs at our locations to further enhance our productivity efficiency and
customer satisfaction while we anticipate continued benefits from these ppi
initiatives as well as our continuing sourcing activities future benefits are
expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve

       our new branding strategy could be unsuccessful we historically operated
our business largely as autonomous unaffiliated companies and as a result
each of our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names
our new marketing and branding strategy transitions multiple unrelated brands
to two brands thermo electron and spectraphysics several of our former brands
such as finnigan nicolet and oriel commanded strong market recognition and
customer loyalty we believe the transition to the two new brands enhances and
strengthens our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire
company our success in promoting our brands depends on many factors including
effective communication of the transition to our customers acceptance and
recognition by customers of these new brands and successful execution of the
branding campaign by our marketing and sales teams if we are not successful
with this strategy we may experience erosion in our product recognition brand
image and customer loyalty and a decrease in demand for our products

       it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving
internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or
declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a
number of strategies to improve our internal growth including

        finding new markets for our products

        developing new applications for our technologies

        combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to
         compete more effectively

        allocating research and development funding to products with higher
         growth prospects

        continuing key customer initiatives

        strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets and

        continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to
         increase and support crossselling opportunities of products and
         services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings

       we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these
strategies may not result in the growth of our business

       as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results
of operations international revenues account for a substantial portion of our
revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international
markets in 2003 our international revenues from continuing operations
including export revenues from the united states accounted for approximately




56 of our total revenues the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates takes on different forms international revenues are subject to the risk
that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and
the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in
international markets where payment for our products and services is made in
the local currency as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally
invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they
primarily do business the functional currency movements in the invoiced
currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash
flows and our results of operations in addition reported sales made in
nonus currencies by our international businesses when translated into us
dollars for financial reporting purposes fluctuate due to exchange rate
movement should our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in
fiscal 2003 and 2002 currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of
our continuing operations of 1208 million and 287 million respectively
while in fiscal 2001 the unfavorable effects of currency translation decreased
revenues of our continuing operations by 465 million

       our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or
successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material
adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition
of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products
and services promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for
a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers and the need
for regulatory including antitrust approvals we may not be able to identify
and successfully complete transactions any acquisition we may complete may be
made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the
acquired company further we may not be able to integrate any acquired
businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses
profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these
acquisitions which could adversely affect our business

       moreover we previously acquired several companies and businesses as a
result of these acquisitions we recorded significant goodwill on our balance
sheet which amounts to approximately 16 billion as of december 31 2003 we
assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well
as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be
impaired these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a
significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset
our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash
flows of these businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well
we have integrated these businesses if we are not able to realize the value of
the goodwill we may be required to incur material charges relating to the
impairment of those assets



item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

       the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates
currency exchange rates and equity prices which could affect its future
results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure
to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities
additionally the company uses shortterm forward contracts to manage certain
exposures to currencies the company enters into forward currencyexchange
contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies
other than its subsidiaries local currencies the company does not engage in
extensive currency hedging activities however the purpose of the companys
currency hedging activities is to protect the companys local currency cash
flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates
the companys forward currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions
denominated in us dollars euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and
swiss francs income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as
offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being
hedged the company does not enter into speculative currency agreements




interest rates

       certain of the companys shortterm availableforsale investments and
longterm obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates interest rate
changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial
instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate
at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument a 10 decrease
in yearend 2003 and 2002 market interest rates would result in a negative
impact to the company of 1 million and 2 million respectively on the net
fair value of its interestsensitive financial instruments

       in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the
companys interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments a
100basispoint increase in 90day libor at december 31 2003 and december 28
2002 would increase the companys annual pretax interest expense by 1 million
and 4 million respectively

currency exchange rates

       the company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a
functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as longterm
the companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the
companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros
british pounds sterling and japanese yen the effect of a change in currency
exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is
reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of
shareholders equity a 10 depreciation in yearend 2003 and 2002 functional
currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of
shareholders equity of 89 million and 76 million respectively

       the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to
changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange
contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon
termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange
rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2003 and 2002 currency exchange rates
related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized
loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 23 million and 33 million
respectively the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange
contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to
approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged

       certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive
to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related
yearend 2003 and 2002 currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact
of 21 million and 12 million respectively on the companys net income

equity prices

       the companys availableforsale investment portfolio includes equity
securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price in addition the
companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of
the companys common stock changes in equity prices would result in changes in
the fair value of the companys availableforsale investments and convertible
obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the
market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument a
10 decrease in yearend 2003 and 2002 market equity prices would result in a
negative impact to the company of 10 million and 9 million respectively on
the net fair value of its pricesensitive equity financial instruments
principally its availableforsale investments

general development of business

       thermo electron corporation also referred to in this document as thermo
electron we the company or the registrant is a world leader in
hightech instruments the company helps life science laboratory and
industrial customers advance scientific knowledge enable drug discovery
improve manufacturing processes and protect people and the environment with
instruments scientific equipment and sampleinknowledgeout solutions the
companys powerful technologies help researchers make discoveries that will
fight disease or prolong life they automatically monitor and control online
production to ensure the quality and safety of raw materials as well as the
endproducts themselves and they are critical components embedded as enabling
technologies within scientific and industrial devices

       in the late 1980s thermo electron adopted a strategy of spinning out
certain businesses into separate public subsidiaries in which we kept a majority
ownership by 1997 we had spun out 22 public entities serving many diverse
markets to simplify our structure we announced in january 2000 a major
reorganization that ultimately resulted in taking private all of our public
subsidiaries selling noncore businesses and spinning off our paper recycling
and medical products businesses as part of the reorganization we divested of
businesses with aggregate annual revenues of approximately 2 billion this
reorganization was substantially completed in february 2002 when we took
private spectraphysics inc our last publicly traded subsidiary

       the businesses spun off and sold as part of our reorganization have been
accounted for as discontinued operations see business segments and products
the companys continuing operations solely include its instrument businesses
except where indicated the information presented in this report pertains to our
continuing operations

business segments and products

       we report our business in three principal segments also called
sectors life and laboratory sciences measurement and control and optical
technologies

       during 2002 the company transferred management responsibility for
several businesses between sectors as follows 1 the spectroscopy businesses
were moved to the life and laboratory sciences sector from the measurement and
control sector 2 the temperaturecontrol businesses were moved to the
measurement and control sector from the optical technologies sector 3 the
electrochemistry products business was moved to the measurement and control
sector from the life and laboratory sciences sector and 4 the thermo projects
unit was moved from a separate sector previously included as other to the
life and laboratory sciences sector priorperiod sector information has been
restated to reflect these changes

       for financial information about segments including domestic and
international operations and export sales see note 3 to our consolidated
financial statements beginning on page f1 of this report

sector changes for 2003

       during the first quarter of 2003 we finetuned the makeup of our three
sectors we have moved the compositionalmetrology business formerly in optical
technologies and our elementalanalyzer business formerly in measurement and
control into the life and laboratory sciences sector these two businesses are
part of the newly created scientific instruments division which also comprises
the former spectroscopy and analytical instruments divisions the new division
better aligns our businesses with the way customers work specifically the life
and laboratory sciences sector is now organized to provide all our sample
preparation handling and storage offerings through the bioscience technologies
division all our analytical solutions through the scientific instruments
division and our informationmanagement offerings through the informatics and
services division we continue to provide a full range of products and services
to the distinct clinical marketplace through the clinical diagnostics division

       in addition we have moved our ultrahighvacuum systems and semiconductor
testing businesses formerly part of the optical technologies sector into the
measurement and control sectors temperature control division this brings
together all of our technologies for maintaining and monitoring precise
operating conditions in process environments our optical technologies sector
now comprises all of our lasers and photonics offerings which we united under
the spectraphysics brand name

       we believe this sector alignment will help us achieve greater efficiency
in our operations increase market awareness of our product offerings in the
marketplace and capture crossselling opportunities that exist between the
formerly separate organizations in addition we believe this structure will
enable us to better develop and provide integrated endtoend solutions based on
our customers needs these changes will be reflected in our financial reports
beginning in the first quarter of 2003

discontinued operations

       as a result of our january 2000 reorganization plan a number of
businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations businesses in
this category included kadant inc a supplier of systems to the papermaking and
paper recycling industry as well as fiberbased consumer products and viasys
healthcare inc a manufacturer of a range of medical products for diagnosis and
monitoring kadant was spun off to shareholders in august 2001 and viasys was
spun off in november 2001 these businesses together with a number of operating
units that were sold constituted the companys former energy and environment
biomedical and emerging technologies and recycling and resource recovery
segments at march 7 2003 one operating unit with revenues of 31 million in
2002 remained for sale in discontinued operations





new products and research and development

       our business includes the development and introduction of new products
and may include entry into new business sectors we are not currently committed
to any new products that require the investment of a material amount of our
assets nor do we have any definitive plans to enter new businesses that would
require such an investment

       during 2002 2001 and 2000 we spent 1551 million 1716 million and
1768 million respectively on research and development

raw materials

       our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of
raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do
not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our
business

patents licenses and trademarks

       patents are important in each segment of our business no particular
patent or related group of patents is so important however that its loss
would significantly affect our operations as a whole generally we seek patent
protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and
incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of
interest patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not
always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or
contracts

       we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where
appropriate we use trademarks or register our products we also enter into
license agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and
knowhow

seasonal influences

       revenues in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in
the other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial customers

working capital requirements

       there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to
customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital

dependency on a single customer

       there is no single customer the loss of which would have a material
adverse effect on our business no customer accounted for more than 10 of our
total revenues in any of the past three years

backlog

       our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2002 and 2001 was as follows

                                                                                                            380595     432624
                                                                                                                 






       in the third quarter of 2002 following the companys acquisition of the
remaining minority interest in spectraphysics the company conformed the lasers
divisions backlog policy to the prevailing practice at the companys other
businesses of including in backlog only product orders that are expected to ship
within six months the lasers divisions historical practice had been to include
orders expected to ship within 12 months this change resulted in a reduction of
backlog of 393 million the remaining decrease in backlog in the optical
technologies sector was principally due to economic conditions facing customers
in the semiconductor and other industrial markets we believe that virtually all
of our backlog at the end of 2002 will be filled during 2003

government contracts

       although the company transacts business with various government agencies
no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or
termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have
a material adverse effect on the companys financial results

competition

item 7    managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
           of operations

       reference is made throughout this managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations to footnotes included in notes to
consolidated financial statements beginning on page f11 of this report

overview

       the company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are
sold worldwide the company expands the product lines and services it offers by
developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic
acquisitions of complementary businesses in january 2000 the company announced
a major reorganization plan under which it planned to sell or spin off many
noncore businesses in 2001 the company modified the plan and sold its
powergeneration business as a result of these actions the companys
continuing operations solely include its instrument businesses the results of
the businesses that have been spun off sold or placed for sale have been
presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements
the companys continuing operations fall into three principal business segments
life and laboratory sciences measurement and control and optical technologies

       the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and
results of operations is based upon its financial statements which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires
the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates
including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets warranty
obligations income taxes contingencies and litigation restructuring and
discontinued operations the company bases its estimates on historical
experience current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that
management believes are reasonable the results of these estimates form the
basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the
values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

       the company believes the following represent its critical accounting
policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements

       a the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
           losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts
           due if the financial condition of the companys customers were to
           deteriorate reducing their ability to make payments additional
           allowances would be required

       b the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence
           for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value
           based on recent usage and expected demand if ultimate usage or
           demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand additional
           writedowns may be required

       c the company assesses the realizability of its notes receivable based
           on judgments concerning the borrowers ability to make the required
           payments if the financial condition of the borrower were to
           deteriorate charges to reduce the carrying value of notes receivable
           may be necessary




       d the company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using
           market comparables for similar businesses and forecasts of discounted
           future cash flows should the fair value of the companys goodwill
           decline because of reduced operating performance market declines or
           other indicators of impairment charges for impairment of goodwill
           may be necessary

       e the company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when
           indication of potential impairment exists such as a significant
           reduction in cash flows associated with the assets should future
           cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts charges for
           impairment of other intangible assets may be necessary

       f in instances where the company sells equipment with an obligation to
           install it at a customer site the company assesses the complexity of
           the installation to determine the timing of revenue recognition if
           the nature of the companys products and the related installation
           obligations changed so that installation were to become more
           complicated and lengthy the company may be required to defer
           additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of
           installation

       g at the time the company recognizes revenue it provides for the
           estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical
           experience should product failure rates or the actual cost of
           correcting product failures vary from estimates revisions to the
           estimated warranty liability would be necessary

       h the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss
           carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected
           profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance
           for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more
           likely than not go unused should the companys actual future taxable
           income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates additional allowances
           may be necessary

       i the company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation and
           provides a reserve for these losses should the ultimate losses on
           contingencies and litigation vary from estimates adjustments to
           those reserves may be required

       j the company records restructuring charges for asset impairment based
           on estimated future cash flows associated with the equipment and for
           the cost of vacating facilities based on expected subrental income
           should actual cash flows associated with impaired equipment and
           subrental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated
           amounts adjustments may be required

       k the company estimates the expected proceeds from the sale of its
           discontinued businesses and when necessary records losses to reduce
           the carrying value of these businesses to estimated realizable value
           should the actual proceeds which would include postclosing purchase
           price adjustments vary from estimates actual results could differ
           from expected amounts

results of operations

       the discussion of operating income and operating income margin throughout
this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations includes references to amounts determined in accordance with us
generally accepted accounting principles gaap as well as amounts that exclude
restructuring costs gains and losses on the sale of businesses and certain
other items that are discussed by segment below and in more detail in note 15
the company believes that this presentation which is substantially consistent
with how it measures its operating performance provides information that
investors may find useful as the items while recurring in the years presented
vary significantly from period to period




2002 compared with 2001

continuing operations

       sales in 2002 were 2086 billion a decrease of 1019 million or 5
from 2001 excluding the effect of acquisitions divestitures and currency
translation revenues decreased 1013 million or 5 currency translation had
a favorable effect on revenues as discussed below by segment due to the
weakening of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries in which the
company operates

       operating income was 1555 million in 2002 compared with 342 million
in 2001 segment operating income increased to 2058 million in 2002 from 852
million in 2001 segment operating income is operating income excluding costs
incurred at the companys corporate office operating and segment operating
income in 2002 were reduced by additional charges associated with a
restructuring plans initiated during the fourth quarter of 2001 other
restructuring actions initiated in 2002 and certain other costs net note 15
operating and segment operating income in 2001 were reduced by charges
associated with restructuring plans initiated during 2001 and certain other
charges net the restructuring and other items in both periods are discussed by
segment below and in more detail in note 15 excluding the restructuring and
other costs which totaled 587 million in 2002 and 1473 million in 2001
segment operating income was 2645 million in 2002 and 2324 million in 2001
the 2001 period included 402 million of goodwill amortization amortization of
goodwill ceased following the adoption of statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets effective in
2002 note 1 excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring and other
items segment operating income totaled 2727 million in 2001 segment
operating income excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring and other
items decreased in 2002 due to lower revenues and the resulting reduced
profitability at a number of businesses discussed below offset in part by the
impact of costreduction and productivity initiatives

       in response to a continued downturn in semiconductor and other industrial
markets served by the company and in an effort to further integrate business
units and reduce the number of real estate locations the company continued
restructuring initiatives in 2002 at a number of business units the
restructuring and related actions primarily consisted of headcount reductions
writedowns of production equipment and abandonment of leases for
telecommunications products and consolidation of facilities to streamline
operations and reduce costs these actions resulted in annual cost reductions
beginning in late 2002 and continuing in early 2003 of approximately 43
million including 7 million in the life and laboratory sciences segment 13
million in the measurement and control segment and 23 million in the optical
technologies segment the company expects to incur an additional 6 million of
restructuring costs in 2003 for charges associated with these actions that
cannot be recorded until incurred such as relocation and moving costs the
company believes that restructuring actions undertaken in 2002 will be
substantially completed by mid2003 the company expects to identify additional
sites to consolidate in 2003 and will record charges in connection with any such
actions

life and laboratory sciences

       sales in the life and laboratory sciences segment increased 259 million
to 1140 billion in 2002 the favorable effects of currency translation
resulted in an increase in revenues of 219 million in 2002 sales decreased
05 million due to divestitures net of acquisitions excluding the effect of
currency translation divestitures and acquisitions revenues grew nominally
increasing 45 million or 04 increased demand for highend technology mass
spectrometry equipment and histology and cytology products was offset in part by
weakened demand for spectroscopy instruments and samplepreparation products
that had midsingle digit percentage declines in sales primarily due to lower
capital spending the company believes that many pharmaceutical customers for
example are delaying purchases except for highend equipment where recent
technological advances may provide a competitive advantage

       operating income margin increased to 156 in 2002 from 95 in 2001
operating income margin is segment operating income divided by segment
revenues the segments operating income margin increased primarily due to the
discontinuation of goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of sfas no
142 in 2002 and higher restructuring and other costs in 2001 compared with
2002 excluding restructuring and other costs net of 183




million in 2002 and 456 million in 2001 and goodwill amortization of 236
million in 2001 operating income margin was 172 in 2002 and 157 in 2001
the increase in operating income margin resulted primarily from cost reduction
and productivity measures undertaken in 2001 and 2002 and to a lesser extent
revenue growth of highermargin products

       in 2002 the segment recorded restructuring and other charges net of
183 million including 114 million of cash costs primarily for severance
abandoned facilities and employee retention at businesses being consolidated
and charges to cost of revenues of 07 million for the sale of inventory
revalued at the date of acquisition and the discontinuation of a product line
in addition the segment realized a net loss of 48 million on the sale of
assets and small business units principally its dynex automated diagnostics
product line and wrote down 14 million of fixed assets at abandoned
facilities note 15 restructuring and other costs net in 2001 included cash
costs of 273 million primarily for severance and abandoned facilities 83
million of asset writedowns 69 million of charges to cost of revenues
principally for discontinued product lines a charge of 34 million for the
writeoff of inprocess research and development at an acquired business 07
million of noncash severance costs and 10 million of gains on the sale of a
small business unit and a product line note 15

measurement and control

       sales in the measurement and control segment decreased 619 million to
6144 million in 2002 sales decreased 294 million due to divestitures net
of acquisitions the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an
increase in revenues of 84 million in 2002 excluding the effect of
divestitures acquisitions and currency translation revenues decreased 409
million or 7 the decrease was due to a decline in revenues in each of the
segments principal businesses particularly the temperature control business
where over half of the decrease occurred the overall revenue decline was due to
economic conditions facing customers particularly in the semiconductor energy
and steel industries the decrease in revenues was offset in part by an increase
in sales of explosivesdetection equipment in the fourth quarter of 2002
following a congressional mandate to begin screening all checked airline baggage
in the united states by the end of 2002 the company expects that a continued
downturn in markets served by the segment will unfavorably affect the segments
revenue comparisons with corresponding prioryear periods in the near term a
prolonged downturn could adversely affect the realizability of the segments
assets which may result in charges for impairment

       the principal divestitures by the segment included the july 2002 sale of
thermo blh and thermo nobel which manufacture and sell straingauges and were
placed for sale in 2001 note 2 the august 2001 sale of its pharos marine
unit which manufactures and sells marinenavigation equipment the april 2001
sale of the cac and mid south businesses which provide the oil and gas industry
with wellhead safety and control products and the july 2001 sale of its
thermomicroscopes unit a manufacturer of scanning probe microscopes the
principal acquisition by the segment included the july 2002 purchase of the
radiationmonitoring products business of saintgobain corporation note 2

       operating income margin increased to 82 in 2002 from 25 in 2001
primarily due to significant restructuring and other costs in 2001 and the
discontinuation of goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of sfas no
142 in 2002 operating income margin excluding restructuring and other costs
net of 133 million in 2002 and 446 million in 2001 and goodwill
amortization of 121 million in 2001 decreased to 103 in 2002 from 109 in
2001 the decrease in operating income margin resulted primarily from the
decrease in revenues offset in part by the effects of cost reduction and
productivity measures undertaken in 2001 and 2002

       in 2002 the segment recorded restructuring and other charges net of
133 million including 201 million of cash costs principally for severance
abandoned facilities and employee retention in addition the segment recorded
87 million of net gains primarily from the sale of businesses principally
its thermo blh and thermo nobel subsidiaries in 2002 the segment recorded
charges to cost of revenues of 14 million for the sale of inventory revalued
at the date of acquisition and 05 million of asset writedowns note 15
restructuring and other costs net




in 2001 included 207 million of cash costs primarily for severance abandoned
facilities and other exit costs 120 million net for the loss on sale of
businesses or writedowns of businesses subsequently sold 82 million of
charges to cost of revenues principally for discontinued product lines 36
million of asset writedowns 10 million for impairment of a note receivable
and 02 million of other costs these charges were offset in part by a gain of
11 million on the sale of a building note 15

optical technologies

       sales in the optical technologies segment decreased 667 million to
3422 million in 2002 the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted
in a decrease in revenues of 16 million in 2002 sales increased 06 million
due to the acquisition of a product line net of divestitures excluding the
effect of currency translation an acquisition and divestitures revenues
decreased 657 million or 16 the decrease was due to a severe slowdown in
the semiconductor and other industrial markets that has adversely affected all
of the segments principal businesses the semiconductor industry is highly
cyclical and is experiencing a downturn that began in 2001 the company expects
that the slowdowns in semiconductor and other industrial markets will continue
to result in unfavorable revenue comparisons with corresponding prioryear
periods in the near term a prolonged downturn could adversely affect the
realizability of the segments assets which may result in charges for
impairment

       in the third quarter of 2002 following the companys acquisition of the
remaining minority interest in spectraphysics the company conformed the lasers
divisions backlog policy to the prevailing practice at the companys other
businesses of including in backlog only product orders that are expected to ship
within six months the lasers divisions historical practice had been to include
orders expected to ship within 12 months this change resulted in a reduction of
backlog of 393 million excluding the effect of this change the segments
backlog decreased 38 during 2002 and totaled 716 million as of december 28
2002

       operating income margin was negative 65 in 2002 compared with
negative 91 in 2001 excluding restructuring and other costs net of 271
million in 2002 and 571 million in 2001 and goodwill amortization of 45
million in 2001 operating income margin was 15 in 2002 and 59 in 2001 the
decrease in operating income margin was due to lower revenues at each of the
segments principal businesses particularly the lasers business
spectraphysics where the decline in revenues led to operating losses
although the business operated profitably in the fourth quarter of 2002
excluding restructuring charges the company initiated additional restructuring
actions in this business in 2002 following those announced in the fourth
quarter of 2001 these actions are discussed below and in note 15

       in 2002 the segment recorded restructuring and other charges net of
271 million including 107 million of cash costs principally for severance
and abandonedequipment leases associated with suspended telecom initiatives
the cash costs also included 07 million for the settlement of litigation note
11 in addition this segment wrote off assets totaling 88 million primarily
for abandoned telecommunication and other manufacturing equipment the segment
also recorded a charge of 08 million resulting from the exchange of options to
purchase shares of spectraphysics for options to purchase shares of thermo
electron following the acquisition of the minority interest in this business in
february 2002 note 17 in 2002 the segment also recorded 70 million of
charges to cost of revenues principally for discontinued product lines the
charges described above were offset in part by a net gain of 02 million from
the sale of a small business unit and land note 15 restructuring and other
costs net in 2001 included 240 million of asset writedowns principally
fixed assets associated with telecommunication initiatives 221 million of
cash costs for severance lease obligations for abandoned equipment and
facilities litigation loss and other exit costs and 110 million of charges
to cost of revenues for inventory writedowns note 15

other income net

       the company reported other income net of 1325 million and 365
million in 2002 and 2001 respectively note 4 other income net includes
interest income interest expense equity in earnings of unconsolidated
subsidiaries gain on investments net and other items net interest income
decreased to 479 million in 2002 from 685 million in 2001 primarily due to
lower invested cash balances following the repurchase and redemption of




company securities acquisitions and to a lesser extent lower prevailing
interest rates the company expects that the lower market interest rates
existing in 2003 will continue to adversely affect the yield it earns as
maturing investments originally invested at higher rates are reinvested at
current lower market rates following redemptions and repurchases of convertible
obligations in 2002 note 10 and repurchases of the companys common stock
lower invested cash will also contribute to an expected reduction in interest
income interest expense decreased to 409 million in 2002 from 718 million
in 2001 as a result of the redemption maturity and repurchase of debentures
as well as entering into interestrate swap arrangements offset in part by

million and 351 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively from the sale of
shares of flir systems inc the company obtained an equity interest in flir as
part of the acquisition of spectraphysics ab in 1999 of the total gain from
the sale of flir shares 395 million and 142 million in 2002 and 2001
respectively represent a recovery of amounts written down in prior years
following a reduction in the companys percentage ownership of flir to less than
20 the company no longer reports its prorata share of flirs earnings but
instead accounts for its remaining investment as an availableforsale security
note 4 gains on investments in 2001 were reduced by a charge of 28 million
to write down two availableforsale securities due to impairment that the
company deemed other than temporary the company recorded income from equity in
earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of 25 million in 2002 and 47 million
in 2001 primarily related to the investment in flir through the first quarter

respectively excluding restructuring and other costs net and gains from the
sale of flir shares the effective tax rate was 310 and 381 in 2002 and
2001 respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2002 primarily due to
the absence of nondeductible goodwill amortization following the adoption of
sfas no 142 and to a lesser extent a reorganization of the companys
subsidiaries in several european countries that resulted in a more taxefficient
corporate structure the effective tax rate exceeded the statutory federal
income tax rate in 2001 due to the impact of state income taxes and
nondeductible expenses which included goodwill amortization excluding
restructuring and other costs net and goodwill amortization the effective tax
rate was 331 in 2001

minority interest income

       minority interest income of 03 million and 58 million in 2002 and

recent accounting pronouncements

       several recent accounting pronouncements may affect the companys
financial statements in the future these rule changes are summarized in note 1

discontinued operations

       during 2002 primarily as a result of new tax regulations concerning
deductible losses from divested businesses the company revised its estimate of
the tax consequences of business disposals in discontinued operations and
recorded a tax benefit of 466 million in addition in 2002 the company sold
its trophy radiologie business for 51 million in cash and principally as a
result of this transaction recorded an aftertax gain of 174 million also
the company sold the last remaining component of its former powergeneration
business in 2002 and realized a gain from the disposition totaling 130
million primarily for previously unrecognized tax benefits that were realized
upon the sale

       in february 2001 the company sold its interest in thermo cardiosystems
inc to thoratec corporation in exchange for 193 million shares of thoratec
common stock certain restrictions which lapsed in august 2002 limited the
timing of the companys ability to sell these shares the company recorded an
aftertax charge of 660 million in the first quarter of 2001 for a decline in
market value of thoratec common stock as a loss on disposal of discontinued
operations following a sale of shares in february 2002 for net proceeds of 104
million and an aftertax gain of 384 million the company owned less than 20
of thoratecs outstanding shares and began accounting for its investment as an
availableforsale security in continuing operations in the first quarter of
2002 with unrealized gains or losses recorded as part of accumulated other
comprehensive items in the accompanying 2002 balance sheet note 17

       in 2001 the company sold a substantial portion of its discontinued
powergeneration business for net proceeds of 249 million and realized an
aftertax gain of 156 million on the disposition

       the company is not currently aware of any known trends events or other
uncertainties involving discontinued operations that it expects will cause the
ultimate loss on disposal of discontinued operations to differ materially from
the amounts recorded to date any difference from the amounts recorded would be
reported as an adjustment to the ultimate loss on disposal of discontinued
operations

2001 compared with 2000

continuing operations

       sales in 2001 were 2188 billion a decrease of 923 million from 2000
excluding the effect of acquisitions divestitures and currency translation
revenues increased 1135 million or 5 currency translation had an
unfavorable effect on revenues as discussed below by segment due to the
strengthening of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries in which
the company operates




       operating income was 342 million in 2001 compared with 2660 million
in 2000 segment operating income decreased to 852 million in 2001 from 3198
million in 2000 operating and segment operating income in 2001 were affected by
restructuring and other costs operating and segment operating income in 2000
were affected by gains from the sale of businesses offset in part by
restructuring and other costs as well as a 17 million operating loss in the
third quarter at a business that was sold the restructuring and other items in
both periods are discussed by segment below and in more detail in note 15
excluding the restructuring and other items which totaled 1473 million of
expense in 2001 and 673 million of income in 2000 segment operating income
was 2324 million in 2001 and 2525 million in 2000 segment operating income
excluding restructuring and other items decreased due to a reduction in segment
operating income of 109 million from businesses divested the company also
recorded 23 million of incremental amortization expense in 2001 which
resulted primarily from the purchase of the minority interests of formerly
public subsidiaries in 2000 offset in part by lower amortization expense
following a number of divestitures in addition certain businesses discussed
below had lower profitability in 2001

       the company undertook restructuring actions in 2001 to reduce costs in
businesses affected by a severe slowdown in the telecommunications and
semiconductor industries as well as other market sectors hurt by a slowing
economy including the us steel and cement industries the restructuring
actions undertaken in 2001 were substantially completed by 2002 in addition to
the actions to reduce costs the company recorded an impairment charge for
equipment used in telecommunication manufacturing at spectraphysics the
company also recorded provisions for inventories related to the discontinuation
of certain mature or unprofitable product lines and inventories made redundant
by combining businesses and for excess telecommunication inventories at
spectraphysics these actions resulted in annual cost reductions of
approximately 63 million with approximately 40 beginning in the fourth quarter
of 2001 and the balance by the third quarter of 2002 including 20 million in
the life and laboratory sciences segment 22 million in the measurement and
control segment 18 million in the optical technologies segment and 3 million
at the companys corporate office

life and laboratory sciences

       sales in the life and laboratory sciences segment increased 677 million
to 1114 billion in 2001 sales increased 179 million due to acquisitions
the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in
revenues of 281 million in 2001 excluding the effect of acquisitions and
currency translation revenues increased 779 million or 7 approximately 40
of the increase was due to higher sales of mass spectrometry products used in
proteomics and drug discovery research of the remaining increase approximately
two thirds was from increased sales of biosciences equipment including
samplepreparation equipment and microplate and liquidhandling products due to
strong demand from the drug discovery market and expanded distribution channels
in addition the segment reported higher revenues from clinical diagnostic
products including rapid diagnostic tests as well as increased sales of
spectroscopy instruments due to new product introductions

       operating income margin decreased to 95 in 2001 from 114 in 2000 the
segments operating income margin in both periods was affected by restructuring
and other charges discussed below excluding restructuring and other costs
net of 456 million in 2001 and 247 million in 2000 operating income margin
was 136 in 2001 and 138 in 2000 the decrease in operating income margin was
primarily due to an increase in goodwill amortization as a result of the
purchase of the minority interests of formerly public subsidiaries excluding
the additional amortization expense and the restructuring and other charges
operating income margin was 138 in 2001 lower profitability due to research
and development expenditures on proteomics initiatives was offset in part by the
effect of higher revenues discussed above

       restructuring and other costs net in 2001 included cash costs of 273
million primarily for severance and abandoned facilities 83 million of asset
writedowns 69 million of charges to cost of revenues principally for
discontinued product lines a charge of 34 million for the writeoff of
inprocess research and development at an acquired business 07 million of
noncash severance costs and 10 million of gains on the sale of a small
business unit and a product line note 15 restructuring costs in 2000
represent 137 million of charges to cost of revenues principally for
discontinued product lines 70 million of cash costs primarily for severance
and abandoned facilities and 40 million of asset writedowns note 15





measurement and control

       sales in the measurement and control segment decreased 2040 million to
6763 million in 2001 sales decreased 1767 million due to divestitures net
of acquisitions the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a
decrease in revenues of 114 million in 2001 excluding the effect of
divestitures acquisitions and currency translation revenues decreased 159
million or 2 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to an 11 decrease in
sales of temperaturecontrol products due to a severe market downturn in the
semiconductor industry and 127 million of lower sales of process instruments
the lower sales of process instruments primarily included weighing and
inspection equipment due to competitive pressures and equipment sold to the
us steel and cement industries due to a downturn in those markets the
decrease in revenue was partially offset by an 88 million increase in sales of
environmentalmonitoring equipment due in part to increased sales of chemical
and radiation monitors as well as demand from the construction industry and
upgrades of power plants in april 2001 the segment sold businesses that
contributed 44 million of the segments internal revenue growth in 2001 a
downturn in some markets served by the segment resulted in a decline in revenues
in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 compared with the same quarters of
2000

       in 2001 the segments principal divestitures included pharos marine
thermomicroscopes and the cac and mid south businesses in 2000 the segments
divestitures primarily included spectra precision nicolet imaging systems and
sierra research and technology inc note 2

       operating income margin decreased to 25 in 2001 from 206 in 2000
primarily due to restructuring and other charges net in 2001 and other income
net in 2000 operating income margin excluding restructuring and other costs
net of 446 million in 2001 and other income net of 981 million in 2000
decreased to 91 in 2001 from 95 in 2000 the decrease in operating income
margin resulted primarily from lower profitability at the business units
discussed above that had declining revenues offset in part by the higher
revenues from sales of environmentalmonitoring equipment discussed above
together with cost reduction measures initiated in 2000 and 2001

       restructuring and other costs net in 2001 included 207 million of
cash costs primarily for severance abandoned facilities and other exit costs
120 million net for the loss on sale of businesses or writedowns of
businesses subsequently sold 82 million of charges to cost of revenues
principally for discontinued product lines 36 million of asset writedowns
10 million for impairment of a note receivable and 02 million of other
costs these charges were offset in part by a gain of 11 million on the sale
of a building note 15 the businesses for which the segment recorded a loss on
or prior to sale were thermomicroscopes and pharos marine in 2000
restructuring and other income net totaled 981 million and included gains on
the sale of businesses net of 1267 million and the related operating loss
of 17 million of one of the divested businesses in the third quarter of 2000
prior to its sale 187 million of asset writedowns to reduce the carrying
value of businesses held for sale to estimated disposal value and for fixed
assets unique to certain discontinued products 61 million of cash costs
primarily for severance and facility costs charges to cost of revenues of 27
million primarily for discontinued product lines and a gain of 06 million
from the termination of a lease note 15

optical technologies

       sales in the optical technologies segment increased 450 million to
4089 million in 2001 sales decreased 04 million due to a divestiture net
of a small acquisition the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted
in a decrease in revenues of 70 million in 2001 excluding the effect of a
divestiture an acquisition and currency translation revenues increased 524
million or 14 the increase in revenues was due in part to 375 million of
increased demand for semiconductorbased lasers used in industrial research and
development and life sciences applications the balance of the increase was due
to higher sales in the first half of 2001 of molecular beam epitaxy systems and
components to the semiconductor industry and to a lesser extent increased
sales of photonics products including gratings and other optical components used
in systems for lithography and telecommunication devices poor economic
conditions in the telecommunications markets resulted in a decline in segment
revenues in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 compared with the same
quarters of 2000




       operating income margin decreased to negative 91 in 2001 from 51 in
2000 excluding restructuring and other costs of 571 million in 2001 and 60
million in 2000 operating income margin was 48 in 2001 and 68 in 2000 the
decrease in operating income margin excluding restructuring and other costs was
primarily due to 28 million of operating losses at spectraphysics from its
telecom product introductions and associated startup costs compared with
profitable operations in 2000 the decrease in operating income margin was also
due to 09 million of higher goodwill amortization in 2001 following the
purchase of the minority interests of formerly public subsidiaries in 2000

       restructuring and other costs net in 2001 included 240 million of
asset writedowns principally fixed assets associated with telecommunication
initiatives 221 million of cash costs for severance lease obligations for
abandoned equipment and facilities litigation loss and other exit costs and
110 million of charges to cost of revenues for inventory writedowns note 15

of revenues principally for discontinued product lines a 15 million writeoff
of inprocess research and development at an acquired business 11 million of
cash costs and 05 million of asset writedowns primarily goodwill on a
business held for sale note 15

by cash used in 2000 and 2001 for the purchase of the minority interests of
formerly public subsidiaries and in 2001 for repurchases of the companys debt
and equity securities interest expense decreased to 718 million in 2001 from

       the company does not use special purpose entities or other
offbalancesheet financing techniques except for operating leases and other
commitments disclosed in the previous table

       the company has no material commitments for purchases of property plant
and equipment and expects that for 2003 such expenditures will approximate 55
to 60 million

       the company believes that its existing resources including cash and
investments future cash flow from operations and available borrowings under
credit facilities are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of
its existing businesses for the foreseeable future including at least the next
24 months

forwardlooking statements

       in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995 we caution readers that the following important
factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could
affect our actual results and could cause our actual results in 2003 and beyond
to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made
by us

       we must develop new products adapt to rapid and significant
technological change and respond to introductions of new products in order to
remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and
expenditures for product development including in the area of proteomics we
sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and
significant technological changes frequent new product and service
introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards without the
timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products
and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which
case our revenue and operating results would suffer

       our customers use many of our products to develop test and manufacture
their own products as a result we must anticipate industry trends and develop
products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products if we
fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities we may
invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not
lead to significant revenue

       many of our existing products and those under development are
technologically innovative and require significant planning design
development and testing at the technological product and
manufacturingprocess levels these activities require us to make significant
investments

       products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological
change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of
new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies
uncompetitive or obsolete our competitors may adapt more quickly to new
technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can the products
that we are currently developing or those we will develop in the future may
not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace and our products
or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete

       we sell our products and services to a number of companies that operate
in cyclical industries which would adversely affect our results of operations
when those industries experience a downturn the growth and profitability of
some of our businesses depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to
cyclical downturns and are experiencing slowing trends for example our optical
technologies segment depends in part on sales to the semiconductor industry and
our measurement and control segment depends in part on sales to the steel and
cement industries a continued slowdown in these industries would adversely
affect sales by these segments which in turn would adversely affect our
revenues and results of operations





       our business is adversely impacted by the continuing general worldwide
economic slowdown and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we
operate continuing adverse economic conditions worldwide could adversely impact
our business in 2003 and beyond resulting in

         reduced demand for some of our products

         increased rate of order cancellations or delays

         increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories

         increased pressure on the prices for our products and services and

         greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable

       for example continued softness in the laboratory equipment industrial
manufacturing and semiconductor markets could adversely affect our future
operating results

       changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or
increase our expenses we compete in many markets in which we and our customers
must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as
environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop
configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those
regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our
products for example many of our instruments are marketed to the
pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in
the us food and drug administrations regulation of the drug discovery and
development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these
products

       demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of
our customers and on government funding policies our customers include
manufacturers of semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors
pharmaceutical and chemical companies laboratories universities healthcare
providers government agencies and public and private research institutions
many factors including public policy spending priorities available resources
and product and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital
spending policies of these entities these policies in turn can have a
significant effect on the demand for our products

       our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material
adverse effect on our business in addition third parties may claim that we
infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation
or licensing expense as a result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining
patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies products
and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing
new products through the development process and into the marketplace our
success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain
and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in
other countries we own numerous us and foreign patents and we intend to file
additional applications as appropriate for patents covering our products
patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by
or licensed to us and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be
sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patents owned by or
licensed to us may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the rights
under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages in addition
competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign
countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased
market position we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits
brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against
others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely
affect our business and results of operations

       we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow which we seek to
protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with our
collaborators employees and consultants these agreements may be breached and
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets
may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors




       third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are
infringing on their intellectual property rights we could incur substantial
costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims which
could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and
results of operations in addition parties making these claims could secure a
judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable
relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell
distribute or market our products and services in the united states or abroad
in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against
us or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that
relate to our products or technology we may seek licenses to such intellectual
property or challenge those patents however we may be unable to obtain these
licenses on commercially reasonable terms if at all and our challenge of the
patents may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or
other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our
products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition and results of operations

       we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have
sold from 1997 through 2002 we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate
annual revenues in excess of 2 billion as part of these transactions we
retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these
businesses such as lawsuits product liability claims and potential claims by
buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were
inaccurate the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse
effect on our results of operations or financial condition however we can not
be certain that this favorable pattern will continue

       we face a number of challenges in integrating and consolidating our
businesses we have historically operated our businesses largely as autonomous
unaffiliated operations for the past few years we have been consolidating our
operations and managing them in a more coordinated manner the following factors
may make it difficult to successfully complete the integration and consolidation
of our operations

         our success in integrating our businesses depends on our ability to
          coordinate or consolidate geographically separate organizations and
          integrate personnel with different business backgrounds and corporate
          cultures

         our ability to combine our businesses requires coordination of
          previously autonomous administrative sales and marketing
          distribution and accounting and finance functions and expansion and
          integration of information and management systems

         the integration and consolidation process could be disruptive to our
          businesses

       moreover we may not be able to realize all of the cost savings and other
benefits that we expect to result from the integration and consolidation
process

       our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential
future savings from new sourcing initiatives as part of our corporate
consolidation over the past two years we have undertaken significant real
estate consolidations and costsavings initiatives relating to sourcing
materials and services purchased by us throughout our businesses while we
anticipate continued significant savings from additional sourcing initiatives
and further real estate consolidations future savings opportunities may be
fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve

       implementation of our new branding strategy may be difficult and could
adversely affect our business we historically operated our business largely as
autonomous unaffiliated companies and as a result each of our businesses
independently created and developed its own brand names we are implementing a
new marketing and branding strategy which involves the transition from multiple
unrelated brands to two brands thermo electron and spectraphysics several of
our existing brands such as finnigan nicolet and oriel command strong market
recognition and customer loyalty we believe the transition to the two new
brands will enhance and strengthen our collective brand image and brand
awareness across the entire company our success in transitioning our brands
depends on many factors including effective communication of the transition to
our customers acceptance and recognition by customers




of these new brands and successful execution of the branding campaign by our
marketing and sales teams if we are not successful in implementing this
strategy and transitioning our brands we may experience erosion in our product
recognition brand image and customer loyalty and a decrease in demand for our
products

       it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving
internal growth some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or
declining over the past several years to address this issue we are pursuing a
number of strategies to improve our internal growth including

         finding new markets for our products including in the area of
          proteomics

         developing new applications for our technologies

         combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to
          compete more effectively

         actively funding research and development

         commencing key customer initiatives

         strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets and

         developing commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and
          support crossselling opportunities of products and services to take
          advantage of our breadth in product offerings

       we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these
strategies may not result in the growth of our business

       we have significant international operations which entail the risk that
exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect demand for our products and our
profitability international revenues account for a substantial portion of our
revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international
markets in 2002 our international revenues from continuing operations
including export revenues from the united states accounted for approximately
52 of our total revenues international revenues are subject to the risk that
fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect product demand and the
profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in
international markets where payment for our products and services is made in
the local currency for example while in fiscal 2002 currency translation had
a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of 287 million in
fiscal 2001 the unfavorable effects of currency translation decreased revenues
of our continuing operations by 465 million

       we have acquired several companies and businesses as a result we have
recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet which we must continually
evaluate for potential impairment we have acquired significant intangible
assets including approximately 14 billion of goodwill that we have recorded
on our balance sheet as of december 28 2002 we assess the realizability of the
goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired these events or
circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in
earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize
the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these
businesses these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have
integrated these businesses






item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

       the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates
currency exchange rates and equity prices which could affect its future
results of operations and financial condition the company manages its exposure
to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities
additionally the company uses shortterm forward contracts to manage certain
exposures to currencies the company enters into forward currencyexchange
contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies
other than its subsidiaries local currencies the company does not engage in
extensive currency hedging activities however the purpose of the companys
currency hedging activities is to protect the companys local currency cash
flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates
the companys forward currencyexchange contracts principally hedge transactions
denominated in us dollars euros british pounds sterling japanese yen and
swiss francs income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as
offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being
hedged the company does not enter into speculative currency agreements

interest rates

       certain of the companys short and longterm availableforsale
investments and longterm obligations are sensitive to changes in interest
rates interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these
financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and
the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument a 10
decrease in yearend 2002 and 2001 market interest rates would result in a
negative impact to the company of 2 million and 9 million respectively on
the net fair value of its interestsensitive financial instruments

       in addition interest rate changes would result in a change in the
companys interest expense due to variablerate debt instruments a 100basis
point increase in 90day libor at december 28 2002 would increase the
companys annual pretax interest expense by 4 million

currency exchange rates

       the company generally views its investment in international subsidiaries
with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as
longterm the companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive
to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the functional currencies of the
companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros
british pounds sterling and japanese yen the effect of a change in currency
exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is
reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of
shareholders equity a 10 depreciation in yearend 2002 and 2001 functional
currencies relative to the us dollar would result in a reduction of
shareholders equity of 76 million and 72 million respectively

       the fair value of forward currencyexchange contracts is sensitive to
changes in currency exchange rates the fair value of forward currencyexchange
contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon
termination of the contract taking into account the change in currency exchange
rates a 10 depreciation in yearend 2002 and 2001 currency exchange rates
related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized
loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of 33 million and 51 million
respectively the unrealized gains or losses on forward currencyexchange
contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to
approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged

       certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive
to changes in currency exchange rates a 10 depreciation in the related
yearend 2002 and 2001 currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact
of 12 million and 17 million respectively on the companys net income





equity prices

       the companys availableforsale investment portfolio includes equity
securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price in addition the
companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of
the companys common stock changes in equity prices would result in changes in
the fair value of the companys availableforsale investments and convertible
obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the
market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument a
10 decrease in yearend 2002 market equity prices would result in a negative
impact to the company of 9 million on the net fair value of its pricesensitive
equity financial instruments principally its availableforsale investments a
10 increase in the yearend 2001 market equity prices would result in a
negative impact to the company of 7 million on the net fair value of its
pricesensitive equity financial instruments principally its convertible
obligations

a   general development of business
      

      thermo electron corporation also referred to in this document as thermo
electron we the company or the registrant is a global leader in the
development manufacture and sale of technologybased instrument systems
components and solutions used in virtually every industry to monitor collect

discoveries that will fight disease or prolong life allow telecommunications
equipment manufacturers to fabricate components required to increase the speed
and quality of communications and monitor and control industrial processes
online to ensure that critical quality standards are met efficiently and
safely

      in the late 1980s thermo electron adopted a strategy of spinning out
certain businesses into separate public subsidiaries in which we kept a majority
ownership by 1997 we had spun out 22 public entities serving many diverse
markets to simplify our structure we commenced in 1999 a major reorganization
that ultimately consisted of taking private all of our public subsidiaries
selling noncore businesses with aggregate revenues in excess of 15 billion
and spinning off our paperrecycling and medical products businesses this
reorganization was substantially completed in february 2002 with the spinin of
spectraphysics inc our last publicly traded subsidiary

      the businesses spun off and sold as part of our reorganization have been
accounted for as discontinued operations see description of business 
principal products and services except where indicated the information
presented in this form 10k pertains to our continuing operations

improve productivity and enable us to better serve our customers with improved
products technologies and complete integrated systems and services we also
intend to emphasize internal growth by investing proceeds from the sale of
noncore businesses to pursue developments in the markets that we serve that have
potential for highgrowth in addition we plan to augment that growth with
strategic acquisitions that expand the reach of our technology by either
rounding out our product lines or bringing them to new markets

      i  principal products and services
           

      we report our business in three principal sectors segments
life sciences optical technologies and measurement and control

life sciences

      we address the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets as well as the
clinical laboratory and healthcare industries through our life sciences sector
this sector is organized into four divisions bioscience technologies
analytical instruments informatics and clinical diagnostics

      bioscience technologies encompasses a broad range of instruments and
consumables such as microplatebased handling and reading equipment optical
biosensors polymerase chain reaction pcr thermal cyclers for deoxyribonucleic
acid dna amplification magnetic particlebased molecular separation
instruments and single nucleotide polymorphism snp scoring systems
consumables include reagents microtiter plates liquidhandling pipettes and
pipette tips biosciences instruments are used primarily by pharmaceutical
companies for drug discovery and development testing and quality control and
by biotechnology companies and universities for research leading to knowledge
about diseases and possible treatments these products are typically used on the
front end of multiinstrument systems as the instruments prepare and handle
samples prior to being loaded into other advanced instruments

      this division also includes a range of scientific equipment used for the
preparation and preservation of chemical and biological samples principally in
research settings for pharmaceutical academic and government customers
products include cell culture incubators ultralowtemperature freezers
highspeed centrifuges centrifugal vacuum concentrators biological safety
cabinets cryopreservation storage tanks and laboratory freeze dryers we also
design manufacture and market electrochemistry products including ph and
ionselective electrolyte ise and other technologies for quality assurance and
regulatory compliance primarily in the environmental food and beverage
chemical pharmaceutical and biomedical research industries these products
determine the quality of various substances from food and pharmaceuticals to
water and wastewater by measuring their ph specific ion concentration
dissolved oxygen and conductivity

      analytical instruments includes our offerings of mass spectrometers
liquid and gas chromatographs and multimeters instrument combinations of these
products along with consumable products such as the vials syringes and
columns necessary for chromatography these systems are used by the
pharmaceutical industry for drug development testing and quality control and
by the biotechnology industry for research leading to knowledge about disease
and possible treatments a significant and growing application for these
instruments is proteomics the study of proteins most drugs  about 90 percent
 interact with proteins so multiinstrument systems that can rapidly identify
and quantify proteins are of increasing value to pharmaceutical and
biotechnology customers we continue to introduce new systems that offer a total
solution for highthroughput analysis such as our surveyor high performance
liquid chromatograph lcq deca mass spectrometer turbosequestr software and
tsqr quantum  the first highresolution ultracompact benchtop triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer

      informatics laboratory information management systems facilitate the
monitoring and analysis of samples by storing and organizing the massive amounts
of analytical data gathered in laboratories industrial settings and
clinicaltesting sites we are a leading supplier of laboratory information
management systems and provide chromatography data systems cds to analyze
chromatographic data obtained via gas or liquid chromatography and capillary
electrophoresis

optical technologies

      we are a leader in optical and semiconductor equipment systems and
technologies that control and apply light throughout the electromagnetic
spectrum for many different uses products within the optical technologies
sector are used in multiple markets  particularly the scientific instrument
microelectronics biomedical and telecommunications industries  to research
fabricate and analyze advanced materials these products are grouped into three
divisions photonics semiconductor and temperature control

      photonics businesses manufacture optical and optoelectronics components
and systems that are used in a variety of industries including scientific and
medical instruments telecommunications and semiconductor applications for
example our diffraction gratings are used in the linenarrowing packages of
excimer lasers used for photolithography systems in semiconductor manufacturing
and in the fabrication of grisms grating and prism for the multiplexing and
demultiplexing of wavelengths in optical telecommunications

      this division also includes spectraphysics a leader in the design
development manufacture and distribution of semiconductorbased lasers and
laser optics for a broad range of applications including active and passive
components for telecommunications passive components are used to mix filter
and adjust the optical signals transmitted through a fiberoptic network while
active components generate and amplify optical signals or light
spectraphysics has also developed highpower semiconductorbased laser products
for a variety of other commercial markets including computer and
microelectronics manufacturing industrial manufacturing medical image
recording and research and development

      semiconductor products are used in the manufacture of capital equipment
that produces and tests semiconductor chips in particular we are the leading
supplier of molecular beam epitaxy mbe systems for the manufacture of gallium
arsenide and other compound semiconductor devices the largest application of
these systems is for microwave devices used in cellular telephones and other
highspeed wireless communications devices in 1999 we introduced the v150 mbe
a successor to our v100 mbe system the v150 mbe helps customers keep pace with
the rapidly growing demand for highspeed telecommunications devices by
significantly increasing semiconductor production capacity in 2000 we
introduced the theta probe a nextgeneration semiconductor metrology tool to
analyze defects in ultrathin surface layers of a chip

      temperature control systems are necessary for laser semiconductor
analytical laboratory industrial and research and development applications
we are the leading manufacturer of precision temperaturecontrol products for
these applications and also supply instruments that analyze materials for
viscosity surface tension and thermal properties customers include the food
and beverage industries as well as manufacturers of paints and ink products
which use highprecision viscometers to maintain the quality and consistency of
their products





measurement and control

      we provide a range of realtime online sensors monitors and control
systems through our measurement and control sector these products help
manufacturers improve and refine their processes to increase productivity and
quality these improvements also help our customers meet government standards
for product and worker safety this sector is organized into three divisions
spectroscopy process instruments and environmental instruments

      spectroscopy instrumentation uses various optical techniques to determine
in a nondestructive manner the elemental and molecular composition of a wide
range of complex liquids and solids customers include pharmaceutical specialty
chemical steel and basic material producers who use these instruments either
in a laboratory or integrated directly into the production line

      process instruments includes a comprehensive family of online weighing and
inspection equipment for consumer products packaged goods and bulk materials
products for the packaged and consumer goods market ensure that each package
contains the proper quantity of a specific item we use a variety of
technologies including xray imaging and ultratrace chemical detection to
inspect food beverage and pharmaceutical packages to see that they are free of
physical contaminants and contain no missing or broken parts in bulk materials
our product line includes solidsflowmonitoring and level measurement for a
wide variety of process industries including food chemicals plastics and
pharmaceuticals

      also included in this division are online process optimization systems
that use proprietary ultrahighspeed noninvasive measurement technologies to
analyze the physical and chemical properties of streams of raw materials such
as coal cement minerals and pharmaceuticals in real time this technology
allows the entire stream of material to be analyzed and eliminates the need for
offline sampling which can add production time and cost we also provide
process optimization systems that measure the total thickness basis weight and
coating thickness of webtype finished materials such as metal strip plastics
foil rubber glass and paper

      in addition we provide sophisticated systems for the fieldmeasurement
and sensor sector of the processcontrol market to improve efficiency provide
process and quality control maintain regulatory compliance and increase worker
safety these systems provide realtime data collection analysis and local
control functions using a variety of technologies including radiation radar
ultrasonic and vibrational measurement principles as well as flowmonitoring
meters gas chromatography mass spectrography and xray fluorescence
industries served include oil and gas chemical semiconductor pharmaceutical
electric utility minerals and mining water and wastewater treatment and pulp
and paper

      environmental instruments and systems monitor pollutants generated by
industrial and mobile sources these include continuous gaseous and aerosol
monitors and waterquality instruments for assessing ambient air quality
emissions and effluents from stationary sources compounds measured include
common air pollutants aerosols and organic halogens and carbon we also
provide a comprehensive line of gas detectors for controlling and detecting the
presence of combustible and toxic gases for worker and plant safety these
products range from simple handheld generalpurpose portable equipment to more
sophisticated fixed systems in addition we supply a range of products for
monitoring and detecting radiation at power plants including portable radiation
and contamination monitors as well as electronic dosimetry and hand probes for
protecting power plant personnel these devices are also being used in border
crossings and other public venues for publicsafety purposes

sector changes

      during the first quarter of 2002 we finetuned the makeup of our three
sectors the spectroscopy division formerly part of our measurement and control
sector became part of the renamed life and laboratory sciences sector and our
temperature control division moved from optical technologies to measurement and
control we also transferred our business that markets electrochemistry products
from the life and laboratory sciences sector into the measurement and control
sector we believe this structure enables us to better develop and provide
integrated endtoend solutions based on our customers needs these changes
will be reflected in our financial reports beginning in the first quarter of
2002




discontinued operations


      as a result of our january 2000 reorganization plan a number of
businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations businesses in
this category included kadant inc a supplier of systems to the papermaking
and recycling industry as well as fiberbased consumer products and viasys
healthcare inc a manufacturer of a range of medical products for diagnosis and
monitoring kadant was spun off to shareholders in august 2001 and viasys was
spun off in november 2001 these businesses together with a number of operating
units sold constituted the companys former energy and environment biomedical
and emerging technologies and recycling and resource recovery segments at
march 15 2002 two operating units with aggregate revenue of approximately 90
million remained for sale in discontinued operations

      ii and xi   new products research and development
                      

      our business includes the development and introduction of new products and
may include entry into new business sectors we are not currently committed to
any new products that require the investment of a material amount of our assets
nor do we have any definitive plans to enter new businesses that would require
such an investment

      during 2001 2000 and 1999 we spent 1716 million 1768 million and
1711 million respectively on research and development

      iii  raw materials
             

      our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of
raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources we do
not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our
business

      iv patents licenses and trademarks
           

      patents are important to our business no particular patent or related
group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly
affect our operations as a whole generally we seek patent protection for
inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our
products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights
resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue
exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts

      we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate
we use trademarks or register our products we also enter into license
agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow

      v  seasonal influences
           

      revenues in the fourth calendar quarter are historically stronger than in
the other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial and academic
customers

      vi working capital requirements
           

      there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to
customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital

      vii  dependency on a single customer
             

      no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in any of
the past three years






                                                                                               



      viii  backlog
              

      our backlog of firm orders at yearend 2001 and 2000 was as follows

in thousands                                                                             2001       2000


life sciences                                                                          128652   118284
optical technologies                                                                    171572    257485
measurement and control                                                                 133485    184621
other                                                                                     1328          
intersegment                                                                             2413    4000
                                                                                          

                                                                                       432624   556390
                                                                                          


      the decrease in backlog in the optical technologies and measurement and
control sectors arose principally due to a slowdown in markets served by these
businesses for further discussion see item 7 managements discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations the measurement and
control sectors backlog was 168 million at the end of 2000 excluding
businesses subsequently divested we believe that virtually all of our backlog
at the end of 2001 will be filled during 2002

a   general development of business
      

      thermo electron corporation also referred to in this document as thermo
electron we the company or the registrant is a global leader in the
development manufacture and sale of technologybased instrument systems
components and solutions used in virtually every industry to monitor collect
and analyze data to provide knowledge for the user for example our powerful
analysis technologies help biotech researchers sift through data to make the
discoveries that will fight disease or prolong life allow telecommunication
equipment manufacturers to fabricate components required to increase the speed
and quality of communications and monitor and control industrial processes
online to ensure that critical quality standards are met efficiently and
safely

      in the late 1980s we adopted a strategy of spinning out certain
businesses into separate public subsidiaries in which we kept a majority
ownership by 1997 we had spun out 22 public entities serving many diverse
markets

      in 1998 we began to reorganize and simplify our structure to regain
business focus during 1999 three of our public subsidiaries were taken private
and then a fourth in early 2000 in january 2000 we announced a major
reorganization that would allow us to focus solely on our instruments business
as part of this plan we took private all of our remaining public subsidiaries
other than spectraphysics lasers inc spectraphysics or spli in which we
acquired a majority interest in 1999 and continue to own 78 percent thermo
fibertek inc and its thermo fibergen inc subsidiary which are discussed
below and thermo cardiosystems inc which we sold in february 2001 in
addition we decided to sell noncore businesses with aggregate revenues of more
than 1 billion we also expect to issue as a dividend to our shareholders two
businesses that we plan to spinoff completely
        one business serves the healthcare industry with a range of medical
         products for diagnosis and monitoring
        the other thermo fibertek supplies systems to the paper making and
         recycling industry as well as fiberbased consumer products

      in february 2001 the company announced that it had entered into a
definitive agreement to sell its power generation business

      the businesses to be spun off and sold as part of our reorganization have
been accounted for as discontinued operations see description of business
principal products and services except where indicated the information
presented in this form 10k pertains to our continuing operations

      our strategy going forward is to emphasize internal growth by investing
proceeds from the sale of noncore businesses to pursue developments in the
highgrowth markets that we serve particularly life sciences and optical
technologies we also plan to augment that growth by making complementary
acquisitions

      thermo electron is a delaware corporation and was incorporated in 1956
the company completed its initial public offering in 1967 and was listed on the
new york stock exchange in 1980

c   description of business
      

      i  principal products and services
           

      we report our business in three sectors  life sciences optical
technologies and measurement and control

life sciences

      we address the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets as well as the
clinical laboratory and healthcare industries through our life sciences sector
this sector is organized into five divisions analytical instruments clinical
diagnostics scientific equipment biosciences and informatics

      analytical instruments includes our offerings of mass spectrometers
liquid and gas chromatographs and multiinstrument combinations of these
products along with consumable products such as the vials syringes and
columns necessary for chromatography these systems are used by the
pharmaceutical industry for drug development testing and quality control and
by the biotechnology industry for research leading to knowledge about disease
and possible treatments a significant and growing application for these
instruments is proteomics the study of proteins most drugs  about 90 percent
interact with proteins so multiinstrument systems that can rapidly identify
and quantify proteins are of increasing value to pharmaceutical and
biotechnology customers in early 2000 we introduced an integrated
highthroughput system for the quantitative analysis of proteins employing the
companys new surveyor high performance liquid chromatograph lcq deca mass
spectrometer and new turbosequest software later in the year we introduced
the tsqr quantum the first highresolution ultracompact benchtop triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer

      clinical diagnostics equipment and supplies are used by healthcare
laboratories in doctors offices and hospitals to detect and diagnose disease
products in this group include sample preparation instruments and materials to
highlight abnormal cells blood gas and ionselective electrolyte ise
consumables chemistry reagents clinical biochemistry instruments and
automation equipment and rapid diagnostic tests for use in physicians offices
we received us food and drug administration fda clearance in december 1998
for our flu oia 15minute diagnostic test which detects influenza a and b in
patient samples we also make the only fdacleared rapid test for streptococcus
b which is one of the leading causes of brain damage in newborns

      scientific equipment is used for the preparation and preservation of
chemical samples principally in research settings for pharmaceutical academic
and government customers products in this group include ultralowtemperature
freezers highspeed centrifuges centrifugal vacuum concentrators and
laboratory freeze dryers we also design manufacture and market
electrochemistry and other technologies for quality assurance and regulatory
compliance primarily in the environmental food and beverage chemical
pharmaceutical and biomedical research industries these products determine the
quality of various substances from food and pharmaceuticals to water and
wastewater by measuring their ph specific ion concentration dissolved oxygen
and conductivity

      biosciences instruments and consumables encompass a broad range of
products such as microplatebased handling and reading equipment optical
biosensors polymerase chain reaction pcr thermal cyclers for deoxyribonucleic
acid dna amplification magnetic particlebased molecular separation

      iv  patents licenses and trademarks
            

      patents are important to our business no particular patent or related
group of patents is so important however that its loss would significantly
affect our operations as a whole generally we seek patent protection for
inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our
products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest patent rights
resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue
exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts

      we protect some of our technology as trade secrets and where appropriate
we use trademarks or register our products we also enter into license
agreements with others to grant andor receive rights to patents and knowhow

      v  seasonal influences
           

continuing operations


      there are no material seasonal influences on sales of our products

discontinued operations


      thermo ecotek which was previously our power generation segment has
typically earned much of its income from may through october many of thermo
ecoteks power plants operate in california in that state our agreements with
our customers provide strong incentives to operate during the summer months
which are a period of high energy demand likewise thermo ecotek typically
reports only a marginal profit during the first three months of the year due to
the rate structures under these agreements due to the expiration of the fixed
price contracts at thermo ecoteks california plants the seasonality of this
business was reduced in 2000

      vi    working capital requirements
              

      there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to
customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital
