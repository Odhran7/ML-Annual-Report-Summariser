resort operations 

general 

most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development acquisitions or investments and repay debt financings 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts except as otherwise described related to the impact of covid19 typically operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of empire city which operates 20 hours a day every day of the year though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions far east baccarat volumes the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and lunar new year our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we also lease space to thirdparty retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities 

as of december 31 2021 we have three reportable segments las vegas strip resorts regional operations and mgm china as generally described below see note 17 for detailed financial information about our reportable segments 

las vegas strip resorts and regional operations 

las vegas strip resorts las vegas strip resorts consists of the following casino resorts aria including vdara upon acquisition in september 2021 bellagio mgm grand las vegas including the signature mandalay bay including delano and four seasons the mirage luxor new yorknew york including the park excalibur park mgm including nomad las vegas and circus circus las vegas until the sale of such property in december 2019 

regional operations regional operations consists of the following casino resorts mgm grand detroit in detroit michigan beau rivage in biloxi mississippi gold strike tunica in tunica mississippi borgata in atlantic city new 

jersey mgm national harbor in prince george’s county maryland mgm springfield in springfield massachusetts empire city in yonkers new york upon its acquisition in january 2019 and mgm northfield park in northfield park ohio upon mgm’s acquisition of the operations from mgp in april 2019 

over half of the net revenue from our las vegas strip resorts is typically derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities and the majority of the net revenue from our regional operations is typically derived from gaming operations although our domestic customer mix has changed in the near term as a result of the covid19 pandemic our longterm strategy continues to be to market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 

our casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games and through betmgm we offer online sports betting and igaming in certain jurisdictions in the united states in addition we provide our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere 

mgm china 

we own approximately 56 of mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise sa “mgm grand paradise” the macau company that owns and operates the mgm macau and mgm cotai casino resorts and holds the related gaming subconcession and land concessions we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability although visitation during 2020 and 2021 was significantly reduced by the covid19 pandemic we expect the longterm future growth of the asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at mgm macau and mgm cotai 

our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and mgm cotai discussed further below mgm china’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise a subsidiary of mgm china the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sjm resorts sa sjmsa formerly sociedade de jogos de macau sa which expires in june 2022 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos or gaming areas require government approval prior to commencing operations see “risk factors — risks related to our macau operations — the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession or refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022 or mgm grand paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the macau government any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows” 

as discussed above gaming in macau is currently administered by the macau government through concessions awarded to three different concessionaires and three subconcessionaires of which a subsidiary of mgm china mgm grand paradise is a subconcessionaire in 2019 the expiration of mgm grand paradises subconcession term was extended from march 31 2020 to june 26 2022 consistent with the expiration of the other concessionaires and subconcessionaires pursuant to the current macau gaming law upon reaching the maximum duration of 20 years the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the chief executive which period may not exceed in total 5 years on january 14 2022 the macau government disclosed the content of a bill to amend macau gaming law which followed a 45day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in september 2021 under the bill the existing subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain circumstances the bill is subject to debate and approval by the macau legislative assembly the approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to date the macau government has provided no indication as to whether the public tender will take place before expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions but acknowledged that it could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date unless mgm grand paradises gaming subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended the casino area premises and gamingrelated equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the macau government upon expiration and mgm grand paradise will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations in addition certain events relating to the loss termination rescission revocation or modification of mgm grand paradise’s gaming subconcession in macau where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition business properties or results of operations of mgm china taken as a whole may result in a special put option triggering event under mgm china’s senior notes and an event of default under mgm china’s revolving credit facilities mgm 

china continues to closely monitor developments regarding the retendering process or concession extensions including the issuance of guidance by the macau government mgm china intends to respond proactively to all relevant macau government requirements when known relating to the retendering process we cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the current term or that we will be able to obtain a gaming concession in a public tender however management believes that mgm grand paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession when a public tender is held 

corporate and other 

we have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate and management operations our unconsolidated affiliates include the ventures with breit discussed elsewhere and betmgm in september 2021 we completed the acquisition of the 50 ownership interest in citycenter held by infinity world and now own 100 of the equity interest in citycenter accordingly we no longer account for our interest in citycenter under the equity method of accounting and we now consolidate citycenter in our financial statements

customers and competition 

our properties operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors igaming and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally for further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business see “item 1a risk factors — risks related to our business industry and market conditions — we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete including increased competition through online sports betting and igaming and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow” 

our primary methods of successful competition include 

• locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets 

• constructing and maintaining highquality resorts and facilities including luxurious guestrooms stateoftheart convention facilities and premier dining entertainment retail and other amenities 

• recruiting training and retaining wellqualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service 

• providing unique “mustsee” entertainment attractions and 

• developing distinctive and memorable marketing promotional and customer loyalty programs 

las vegas strip resorts and regional operations 

our customers include premium gaming customers leisure and wholesale travel customers business travelers and group customers including conventions trade associations and small meetings we have a diverse portfolio of properties which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and valueoriented tour and travel customers many of our properties have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our properties during midweek and offpeak periods 

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the las vegas strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in las vegas also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas 

outside nevada our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region 

mgm china 

the three primary customer bases in the macau gaming market are vip gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip gaming play has historically been sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play was obtained through external gaming promoters who assist vip players with their travel and entertainment arrangements gaming promoters have been compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements and rolling chip turnoverbased commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor gaming operations has historically exceeded the vip gaming operations due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters we offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players’ use as well as nongaming amenities such as the mansion and mgm cotai emerald villa to attract ultrahigh end customers 

vip gaming at mgm china is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips gaming promoters currently purchase these nonnegotiable chips and in turn they sell these chips to their players the nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are currently based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate they also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate which can be applied to hotel rooms food and beverage and other discretionary 

customerrelated expenses gaming promoter commissions are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue 

in december 2021 we suspended operations with our primary gaming promoters in january 2022 the macau government disclosed the content of a bill to amend the gaming law which includes some restrictions relating to gaming promoters including each gaming promoter can only exercise the activity of gaming promotion for one concessionaire revenue sharing arrangements between concessionaires and gaming promoters are prohibited gaming promoters are prohibited from having exclusive operation of casino reserved areas and gaming promoters are restricted to only providing support to the concessionaires in the promotion of casino gaming activities through commissions the bill is subject to debate and approval by the macau legislative assembly 

we have focused our business on main floor gaming operations and accordingly we do not expect vip gaming operations to be a significant source of revenue in future years the majority of mgm chinas casino revenue has been provided by main floor gaming operations in recent years and we expect this customer base will be the primary source of growth in the future 

our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally we face competition at our macau and cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations primarily on the cotai strip 

we encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of asia and around the world including but not limited to singapore south korea vietnam cambodia the philippines australia and las vegas 

marketing 

our marketing efforts are conducted through various means including our loyalty programs we advertise on radio television internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as by direct mail email and through the use of social media we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major us and foreign cities our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers influence incremental visits and help build lasting customer relationships 

mgm rewards our customer loyalty program is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming and nongaming areas encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts in january 2022 we redesigned our loyalty program to expand the ways in which our customers can earn benefits we also offer the golden lion club for gaming focused customers in addition to m life rewards at mgm china the structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resorts provide our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend

for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business please see below 

risks related to our substantial financial commitments 

our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide of the indebtedness of bellagio breit venture and mgp breit venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations  as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 129 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis including 43 billion of outstanding indebtedness of the operating partnership and 31 billion of outstanding indebtedness of mgm china any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs we do not guarantee mgm china’s or the operating partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and to the extent mgm china or the operating partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness our ability to make additional investments into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility 

in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us including 

• increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements capital expenditures debt service requirements execution of our business strategy including returning value to our shareholders or other general operating requirements 

• making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness or 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to lessleveraged competitors 

we currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the 301 billion and 30 billion principal amount of indebtedness and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon of bellagio breit venture and mgp breit venture respectively the terms of each guarantee provide that after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation which amount may be material and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future if we do not have sufficient cash on hand we may need to raise capital including incurring additional indebtedness in order to satisfy our obligation there can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available will be on terms that are satisfactory to us 

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished the leases for our operating properties have fixed rental payments with annual escalators and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly development projects including any potential future development of an integrated resort in japan strategic initiatives including positioning betmgm as a leader in online sports betting and igaming and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

current and future economic capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments or make planned expenditures  our ability to make payments on our substantial indebtedness and other significant financial commitments including the rent payments under our leases and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and other investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries including mgm china and the operating partnership and borrow under our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness in 2020 and 2021 the covid19 pandemic resulted in significant deterioration to the global economy and substantial declines in our revenues from operations and expected distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries we expect that the recent 

emergence and global spread of covid19 variants may continue to impact consumer spending levels in 2022 and potentially thereafter and if we fail to generate cash sufficient to fund our liquidity needs or satisfy the financial and other covenants in our debt and lease instruments we cannot assure you that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional debt on terms favorable to us or at all 

in addition we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2022 and thereafter our ability to fund or timely refinance and replace our indebtedness will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above if we are unable to fund or refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements or leases 

the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations  covenants governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict among other things our ability to 

• pay dividends or distributions repurchase equity prepay certain debt or make certain investments 

• incur additional debt 

• incur liens on assets 

• sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements and 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger crossdefaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial commitments 

in addition each of mgm china and the operating partnership has issued debt securities and is a borrower under credit facilities all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions require them to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries these restrictions include among other things limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets 

we are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth initiatives service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes  as of december 31 2021 we are required to make annual rent payments of 16 billion in the aggregate under the triplenet lease agreements which leases are also subject to annual escalators as described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the leases also require us to spend a certain amount on capital expenditures at the leased properties in addition the leases governing the bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay aria including vdara real estate assets require us to comply with certain financial covenants which if not met will require us to deposit cash collateral or issue letters of credit for the benefit of the applicable landlord equal to 1 year of rent under the mgm grand las vegas and mandalay bay lease and the aria lease and 2 years of rent under the bellagio lease as a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditure obligations our ability to fund our operations raise capital make acquisitions make investments service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected for example our obligations under the leases may 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures development projects pay dividends repurchase shares and other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• restrict our ability to make acquisitions divestitures and engage in other significant transactions and 

• cause us to lose our rights with respect to the applicable leased properties if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or otherwise default on the leases 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

if any of the transactions are not completed or are not completed on a timely basis our business may be adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed such transactions we may be subject to additional risks costs and expenses including but not limited to the following

the potential litigation instituted against us our transaction counterparties or our respective directors challenging the proposed vici transaction may prevent such transaction from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all potential litigation related to the vici transaction may result in injunctive or other relief prohibiting delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the parties’ ability to complete the vici transaction one of the conditions to the 

vici transaction under the master transaction agreement is that no temporary restraining order preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment order or decree issued by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction prohibiting consummation of the vici transaction or any other transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement shall be in effect accordingly any such injunctive or other relief may prevent the vici transaction from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all in addition defending against such claims may be expensive and divert management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business and the businesses of the counterparties to such transactions 

risks related to our business industry and market conditions 

the global covid19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business financial results and liquidity and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time as of the date of this annual report there continues to be uncertainty around the covid19 pandemic its duration and its impact on us and global economic activity and consumer behavior the omicron variant of covid19 which appears to be the most transmissible and contagious variant to date has caused an increase in covid19 cases globally the impact of the omicron variant or of any other variants that may emerge cannot be predicted at this time and could depend on numerous factors including the availability of vaccines in different parts of the world vaccination rates among the population the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines against the variants and the response by governmental bodies to reinstate mandated business closures orders to “shelter in place” occupancy limitations and travel and transportation restrictions while restrictions have eased throughout 2021 new restrictions to combat the spread of the variants such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation stayathome directives limitations on the size of gatherings closures of work facilities schools public buildings and businesses cancellation of events including sporting events concerts conferences and meetings and quarantines and lockdowns may be put into place in the future in addition the spread of new variants including omicron has had a material impact on domestic and international travel which has resulted in reduced demand for hotel rooms convention space and other casino resorts amenities 

in macau while all of our properties were open during 2021 several travel and entry restrictions were in place in macau hong kong and mainland china including the temporary suspension of ferry services between hong kong and macau the nucleic acid test result certificate and mandatory quarantine requirements for returning residents for visitors from hong kong taiwan and certain regions in mainland china and bans on entry on other visitors which significantly impacted visitation to mgm macau and mgm cotai in addition from time to time during 2021 local covid19 cases were identified in macau upon such occurrences a state of immediate prevention was declared and mass mandatory nucleic acid testing was imposed in macau the validity period of negative test results for reentry into mainland china was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed certain events were cancelled or suspended and in some instances certain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout macau although gaming and hotel operations have remained open during these states of immediate prevention such measures have had a negative effect on mgm grand paradises operations and it is uncertain whether further closures including the closure of mgm grand paradises properties or travel restrictions to macau will be implemented if additional local covid19 cases are identified 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and new variants continue to impact our business results of operations and financial results including the duration and magnitude of such effects will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess including but not limited to the duration and scope of the pandemic and whether there is a or multiple further resurgences in the future the efficacy of the vaccine against existing and new variants of the covid19 virus the adoption rate of vaccines and the ability to effectively and efficiently distribute vaccines domestically and internationally to allow travel to resume to prepandemic levels the negative impact the pandemic has on global and regional economies and economic activity including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending its short and longerterm impact on the demand for travel transient and group business and levels of consumer confidence even after travel advisories and restrictions are lifted our and our business partners ability to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic actions governments businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic including the rise of variant strains of the virus such as limiting or banning travel and limiting or banning leisure casino and entertainment including sporting events activities including the complete or partial closures of our properties and how quickly economies travel activity and demand for gaming entertainment and leisure activities recovers after the pandemic subsides we may also face unforeseen liability or be subject to additional obligations as a result of the covid19 pandemic including as a result of claims alleging exposure to covid19 in connection with our operations or facilities or to the extent we are subject to a governmental enforcement action as a result of health and safety compliance the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described in this section or in any other filings with the sec as a result of the foregoing we cannot predict the ultimate scope duration and impact the covid19 pandemic will have on our results of operations but it may continue to have a material impact on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations including revenues and profitability and stock price 

we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete including increased competition through online sports betting and igaming and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  the hotel resort entertainment and gaming industries are highly competitive we do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area and hotel resort entertainment and gaming operations in other states or countries as well as the increased availability of online sports betting and igaming could attract our customers to the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations competition will increase major competitors including potential new entrants may also expand their hotel room capacity expand their range of amenities improve their level of service or construct new resorts in las vegas macau or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate all of which could attract our customers also the growth of retail gaming in areas outside las vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas and elsewhere for instance local referendums were recently passed to allow retail gaming in virginia and nebraska with active lobbying occurring in additional states while we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peertopeer inventory sources which allow travelers to book shortterm rentals of homes and apartments from owners we expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution innovations in consumerfacing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business 

we have also seen significant expansion across the united states in legalized forms of igaming and online sports betting and expect additional jurisdictions will likely legalize igaming and online sports betting in the future we participate in the domestic igaming and online sports betting market through our venture betmgm which faces significant competition from other industry participants as well as the broader gaming and entertainment industries if betmgm is unable to sustain or grow interest in its offerings it may not be able to gain the scale necessary to successfully compete in the growing market and as a result we may not receive the anticipated benefits from our investment in addition the expansion of igaming online sports betting and other types of gaming may further compete with our landbased operations by reducing customer visitation and spend at our properties 

in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere are enacted including the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia certain areas in the region have legalized casino gaming including japan and others such as taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or igaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities we would face increased competition similarly as a result of macau’s gaming inspection and coordination bureau increasing scrutiny and restrictions imposed on gaming promoters we along with certain other casino operators in macau suspended our primary gaming promoters which has led to substantial declines in revenues from gaming promoters as a result we expect competition for the mass market segment amongst macau operators will grow and if we are unable to maintain and further develop our mass market business and replace revenue previously obtained through use of gaming promoters our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise 

in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside  our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions trade shows and business development adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation economic contraction economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels casino resorts trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer in addition changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel an unstable job market perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other 

acts of violence consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors including demographic changes which for instance have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for nongaming offerings our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and timely react to these trends and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations in particular aria bellagio and mgm grand las vegas may be affected by economic conditions in the far east and all of our nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the united states and california in particular a recession economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition including inflationary pressures affecting consumers corporations or the supply chain generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts which would adversely affect our operating results in addition due to the covid19 pandemic our business has also been impacted by labor shortages and global supply chain disruptions if we are unable to hire and retain sufficient employees to operate our properties or procure necessary supplies our business results of operations and reputation could be negatively impacted 

in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau and mgm cotai and to a lesser extent our domestic properties from mainland china general economic regulatory geopolitical and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements including continued market impacts from the covid19 outbreak and market impacts resulting from china’s anticorruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by nonbank lending entities and crossborder currency monitoring including increased restrictions on union pay withdrawals and other atm limits on the withdrawal of patacas and facial recognition technology on atm machines in macau to strictly enforce the know your customer regulations for mainland chinese bank cardholders could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china andor the amounts they are willing to spend at our properties it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau 

furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of the opening of new developments in macau while we seek employees from outside of macau to adequately staff our resorts certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications for instance the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase including limitations on our ability to import labor as a result of temporary travel restrictions adopted as part of the covid19 mitigation efforts finally because additional casino projects have commenced operations and other projects are under construction the existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our developments in macau could be negatively impacted 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives including those associated with our mgm 2020 plan as part of our mgm 2020 plan we undertook several initiatives to reduce costs and further position us for growth by the end of 2020 in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic we implemented several additional cost savings initiatives in 2020 to improve our operating model however we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all that we will ultimately be able to realize the expected benefits of these or any other cost savings initiatives or that any new additional costs or increases in existing expenses will not offset any cost savings if we fail to achieve the anticipated benefits of any current or future cost savings initiatives our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements during the covid19 pandemic we significantly reduced our historic dividend rate although we intend to pay ongoing regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock our board of directors may in its sole discretion change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely in addition our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in our credit agreement and because we are a holding company with no material direct operations we are dependent on receiving cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock our subsidiaries ability to generate the cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock is subject to their operating results cash requirements and financial condition in addition our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us is subject to any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds available to us and compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties in addition each of the companies in our 

corporate chain must manage its assets liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions future dividend payments may be further reduced or eliminated in their entirety any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

all of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property including risks relating to lease termination lease extensions charges and our relationship with the lessor which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations all of our domestic properties are subject to triplenet leases that in addition to rent require us to pay 1 all facility maintenance 2 all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 3 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on the income of the lessor 4 all capital expenditures and 5 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties we are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities furthermore our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant such as certain events of casualty and condemnation finally our leases limit our ability to cease operations at our properties subject to certain limited exceptions 

paul salem our chairman daniel j taylor one of our directors and corey sanders and john m mcmanus members of our senior management may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at mgp  paul salem serves as our chairman and as the chairman of mgp in addition daniel j taylor one of our directors is also a director of mgp and corey sanders and john m mcmanus members of our senior management are also directors of mgp while we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational documents with respect to mgp contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties including fiduciary duties to any mgp shareholder to the fullest extent permitted by law these overlapping positions could nonetheless create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when our or mgp’s management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities such as potential acquisition targets or face decisions that could have different implications for us and mgp further potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and mgp or its subsidiaries regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship between us and mgp such as under the master lease potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and mgp enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future 

despite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of mgp as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding class b share of mgp mgp has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us including transactions involving consideration in excess of 25 million must be approved in accordance with certain specified procedures which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives we own the single outstanding class b share of mgp the class b share is a noneconomic interest in mgp which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of mgp or upon liquidation or winding up of mgp and which represents a majority of the voting power of mgp’s shares so long as the holder of the class b share and its controlled affiliates’ excluding mgp aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in mgp and the operating partnership does not fall below 30 we therefore have the ability to exercise significant control over mgp’s affairs including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to mgp’s shareholders for approval mgp’s operating agreement however provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any resolution or course of action by mgp’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to mgp if it is i approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors which mgp refers to as “special approval” such independence determined in accordance with the nyse’s listing standards the standards established by the exchange act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement ii determined by mgp’s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to mgp or iii approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates furthermore mgp’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value individually or in the aggregate over 25 million between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any such transaction other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of mgp’s formation transactions a “threshold transaction” shall be permitted only if i special approval is obtained or ii such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates as a result certain transactions including any threshold transactions that we may want to pursue with mgp and that could have significant benefit to us may require special approval there can be no assurance that the required approval will be 

obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent mgp directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates the failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives 

because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified  given that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect our business we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand as a result of limitations on travel imposed to address the covid19 pandemic or otherwise can impact the number of visitors to our resorts additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of our customers reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities 

we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables  we conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players and highend players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming and variances in winloss results attributable to highend gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter furthermore the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these highend customers could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant in the opinion of management an extension of credit uncollectible receivables from highend customers could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations 

furthermore we expect that mgm china will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm china gaming customers are from other jurisdictions mgm china may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm china may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm china remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers 

even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results 

we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect our future profits  we review our goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance significant negative trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in writedowns and impairment charges in the past and if one or more of such events occurs in the future additional impairment charges or writedowns may be required in future periods if we are required to record additional impairment charges or writedowns this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 

leisure and business travel  especially travel by air  are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events  such as terrorist attacks other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases  we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air since most of our customers travel by air to our las vegas and macau properties any terrorist act or other acts of violence outbreak of hostilities escalation of war or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the outbreak of infectious diseases such as covid19 has severely disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt domestic and international travel the covid19 pandemic has resulted in governments public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending and businesses and individuals implementing restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation stayathome directives limitations on the size of gatherings closures of work facilities schools public buildings and businesses 

cancellation of events including sporting events concerts conferences and meetings and quarantines and lockdowns even when those restrictions are removed consumer willingness to attend large scale conferences may be impacted for the foreseeable future due to continued concerns over safety and social distancing see “—the global covid19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business financial results and liquidity and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time” 

furthermore although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts insurance coverage against physical loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable 

coinvesting in properties or businesses including our investment in betmgm decreases our ability to manage risk  in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly we have from time to time invested and expect to continue to invest in properties or businesses as a coinvestor coinvestors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business therefore the operation of such properties or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters in addition investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the coinvestor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives consequently actions by a coinvestor might subject the properties or businesses owned by such entities to additional risk further we may be unable to take action without the approval of our coinvestors or our coinvestors could take actions binding on the property without our consent additionally should a coinvestor become bankrupt we could become liable for its share of liabilities 

for example we share control of betmgm with entain with all major operating investing and financial activities requiring the consent of both members disagreements between us and entain could arise in the future including with respect to the amount and timing of capital contributions if we and entain are unable to support the future funding of betmgm then betmgm may not have the resources to execute on the development or implementation of its strategies including funding efforts to increase its market share which could result in us not receiving the anticipated benefits from our investment in addition if we are awarded a concession to develop an integrated casino resort in japan we would do so in a consortium with orix and other local investors as a result we could be subject to additional risks related to being unable to directly control development activities or the timing of development completion which may impact our ability to complete the project on our anticipated timeline or at all or within the agreed upon specifications 

any of our future construction development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables costs and our ability to complete the projects  

although our business model is primarily assetlight we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for future construction development or expansion projects any of our future construction development or expansion projects such as our proposed integrated resort in japan will be subject to a number of risks including 

• lack of sufficient or delays in the availability of financing 

• changes to plans and specifications 

• engineering problems including defective plans and specifications 

• shortages of and price increases in energy materials and skilled and unskilled labor 

• pricing inflation including wage inflation in key supply markets 

• delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals 

• changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to gaming leisure residential real estate development or construction projects 

• labor disputes or work stoppages 

• availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors 

• disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors 

• personal injuries to workers and other persons 

• environmental health and safety issues including site accidents and the spread of viruses 

• weather interferences or delays 

• fires typhoons and other natural disasters 

• geological construction excavation regulatory and equipment problems and 

• other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases 

the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects 

which we might undertake in addition the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines and any such deadlines are not extended we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties including revenue lost while rooms restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service 

our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer in addition our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future  although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire natural disasters or terrorism or other acts of violence each policy has certain exclusions in addition our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events acts of war loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events rolling blackouts or otherwise deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered at all under our policies therefore certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses 

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event furthermore the leases we entered into in connection with the mgp breit venture transaction and the bellagio saleleaseback transaction require us to maintain specified insurance coverage we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits of insurance coverage required by these leases and to the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all then we would need to obtain amendments to the leases or face a default by the applicable tenant under the lease which could have material adverse effect on our business 

we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or selfinsured retentions or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage 

any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business  the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success while our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks we file applications for and obtain trademarks in the united states and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource we cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the united states and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance competitive advantages or goodwill which could adversely affect our business 

  

a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations as of december 31 2021 approximately 35000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements a prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services also wage andor benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations to the extent that our nonunion employees seek union representation or elect union representation we would have exposure to risks associated with representation proceedings labor negotiations andor economic impacts of newly negotiated labor agreements furthermore we may have or acquire in the future multiemployer plans that are classified as “endangered” 

“seriously endangered” or “critical” status for instance borgata’s most significant plan is the legacy plan of the unite here retirement fund which has been listed in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan which may require additional contributions from employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions andor modifications to retiree benefits in addition while borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time or over a period of time that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of and after withdrawal any such additional costs may be significant 

our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results  we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and therefore higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations accordingly increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results additionally higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues 

we may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets any of which may be unsuccessful  we intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties including mgp acquisitions and investments in businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

• spending cash and incurring debt 

• assuming contingent liabilities 

• unanticipated issues in integrating information communications and other systems 

• unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing logistics marketing and administration methods 

• retaining key employees and 

• consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all in addition even if we are able to identify any such opportunities and complete transactions we cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of our acquisitions or that they will be accretive to our results of operations our estimates and assumptions regarding expected synergies and benefits of our acquisitions could materially change including as a result of factors beyond our control and could delay decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions in addition even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs competitive responses loss of customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention and the expansion of our operations in general whether through acquisition development or internal growth could also cause us to incur substantial costs including legal professional and consulting fees 

in addition we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are noncore no longer complement our business are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums from time to time we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets there can be no assurance however that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data we collect and process information relating to our employees guests and others for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted by the various states the united states and other jurisdictions around the world privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent or conflict between jurisdictions various federal state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy data retention data transfer and data protection for example the european union has adopted a data protection regulation known as the general data protection regulation which became fully enforceable in may 2018 that includes operational and compliance requirements with significant penalties for noncompliance california has enacted a comprehensive privacy law known as the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which went into effect on january 1 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the united states in addition new privacy requirements in california colorado and virginia generally go into effect on january 1 2023 

compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable 

privacy laws and regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us including accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly however they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including but not limited to computer malware viruses hacking and phishing attacks by third parties in addition while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event such coverage may not be sufficient  

we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyberattacks or otherwise could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations for instance there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed our information systems and data including those we maintain with our thirdparty service providers have been subject to cyber security breaches in the past and may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future in addition our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a thirdparty service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation cause a material disruption to our operations and result in remediation expenses regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers business partners other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance factors and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in several areas including diversity and inclusion community engagement and philanthropy environmental sustainability plastic pollution climate change responsible gaming supply chain management workplace conduct human rights and many others some of which may be unforeseen any harm to our reputation could further impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks and costs related to climate change extreme weather conditions potentially exacerbated by climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business which could harm our business and results of operations certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes floods tornados wildfires and winter storms in the united states and severe typhoons in macau such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations or the operations of critical suppliers damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas in addition our operations or the operations of critical suppliers could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water stress or shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate or source critical supplies could adversely affect our business although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions 

furthermore such extreme weather conditions may result in reduced availability or increased price volatility of certain critical supplies may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period additionally many states and municipalities have begun to adopt laws and policies on climate change and emission reduction targets changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased regulatory costs which may include capital expenditures on our existing properties to ensure compliance with any new or updated regulations which may potentially adversely affect our operations there can be no assurance that the potential impacts of climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters and changes in public policy 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations  our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries states and provinces in which we operate these laws regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally concern the responsibility financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations as such our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or alternatively cease operations in that jurisdiction in addition unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations furthermore our igaming and online sports betting initiatives may be particularly subject to risks related to potential changes in the regulatory environment as a result of the continued development of regulations in this industry for example in 2018 the us department of justice “doj” reversed its previouslyissued opinion published in 2011 which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the wire act of 1961 “wire act” the doj’s updated opinion concluded instead that the wire act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to nonsportsrelated wagering activity in june 2019 a federal district court in new hampshire ruled that the doj’s new interpretation of the wire act was erroneous and vacated doj’s new opinion the doj appealed the decision of the district court to the us court of appeals for the first circuit in january 2021 the court of appeals essentially affirmed the decision of the district court and the doj did not file a further appeal for a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business see “regulation and licensing” and exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the property state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards certain public and private issuances of securities borrowings under credit agreements guarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities 

macau laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm china’s interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm grand paradises activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the energy policy act the safe drinking water act renewable portfolio standards the oil pollution act of 1990 and many others under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted in addition effective january 1 2019 smoking in casinos in macau including mgm macau and mgm cotai is only permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms rather than outside smoking areas or vip areas the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance 

we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations for instance we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970 commonly known as the “bank secrecy act” which among other things requires us to report to the internal revenue service “irs” any currency transactions in excess of 10000 that occur within a 24hour gaming day including identification of the individuals involved in the currency 

transaction we are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know suspect or have reason to suspect transactions among other things involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose in addition under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting recordkeeping and retention our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic examinations by the irs any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws including the bank secrecy act or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

furthermore the covid19 pandemic has resulted in governments public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread see “—the global covid19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business financial results and liquidity and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time” in addition to the pandemicrelated restrictions that resulted in the temporary closures of our properties during 2020 governmental or other covid19related restrictions have been extended or reimposed from timetotime and new restrictions may be imposed in the future 

any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or any other similar anticorruption laws could have a negative impact on us  historically a significant portion of our revenue was derived from operations outside the united states which exposes us to complex foreign and us regulations inherent in doing crossborder business and in each of the countries in which we transact business we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and other similar anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws by us or our noncontrolled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us and the sec and us department of justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the fcpa the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees as well as other taxes and fees our results could be adversely affected  state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees including taxes and fees on gaming activities from time to time legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming or other taxes the imposition of new taxes or changes to tax laws that result in increased taxes to us if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase taxes impose new taxes or change existing tax laws our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxes attributable to potential taxable foreignsourced income in future periods including the recapture of overall domestic losses to the extent of 50 percent of us taxable income per year we evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered this evaluation is based on all available evidence including assumptions concerning future us operating profits and foreign source income as a result significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change 

we face risks related to pending claims that have been  or future claims that may be  brought against us  claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time we may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition results of operations and reputation please see the further discussion in “legal proceedings” and note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

risks related to our macau operations 

we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china  as a result of the extension of the macau gaming subconcession we entered into a first renewed deed of noncompete undertakings with mgm china and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king “ms 

ho” pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the people’s republic of china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china while gaming is currently prohibited in china hong kong and taiwan if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of i the date mgm china’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on the stock exchange of hong kong limited or ii the last day of mgm grand paradises subconcession for operation of casino games or any extension thereof or iii the date when our ownership of mgm china shares is less than 20 of the thenissued share capital of mgm china 

the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise  exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession or refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022  or mgm grand paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the macau government any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental noncompliance by mgm grand paradise with applicable macau laws or mgm grand paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such noncompliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the macau government upon such termination all of mgm grand paradise’s casino area premises and gamingrelated equipment would be transferred automatically to the macau government without compensation to mgm grand paradise and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macau government 

furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradise’s compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the subconcession contract expires on june 26 2022 pursuant to the current macau gaming law upon reaching the maximum duration of 20 years the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the chief executive which period may not exceed in total 5 years on january 14 2022 the macau government disclosed the content of a bill to amend macau gaming law which followed a 45day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in september 2021 under the bill the existing subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain circumstances the bill is subject to debate and approval by the macau legislative assembly the approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to date the macau government has provided no indication as to whether the public tender will take place before expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions which is on june 26 2022 but acknowledged that it could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date unless mgm grand paradises gaming subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended the casino area premises and gamingrelated equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the macau government upon expiration and mgm grand paradise will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations in addition certain events relating to the loss termination rescission revocation or modification of mgm grand paradise’s gaming subconcession in macau where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition business properties or results of operations of mgm china taken as a whole may result in a special put option triggering event under mgm china’s senior notes and an event of default under mgm china’s revolving credit facilities beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least 1 year prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to obtain an extension of the subconcession contract or be awarded a new gaming concession on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all in 

addition there is uncertainty on the terms associated with any extension which could include additional fees or other financial commitments that may have an adverse impact on the financial position of mgm grand paradise we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states  our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under nonunited states laws regulations and customs in particular the risks associated with the operation of mgm china or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories include 

• changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in macau or other foreign jurisdictions 

• changes in nonunited states government programs 

• possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with antibribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions 

• general economic conditions and policies in china including restrictions on travel and currency movements 

• difficulty in establishing staffing and managing nonunited states operations 

• different labor regulations 

• changes in environmental health and safety laws 

• outbreaks of diseases or epidemics including the covid19 pandemic 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws 

• political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts 

• economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuations and 

• uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease 

conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china  the holding company for mgm grand paradise which owns and operates mgm macau and mgm cotai  as a result of the initial public offering of shares of mgm china common stock in 2011 mgm china has stockholders who are not affiliated with us and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers andor directors of mgm china may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of mgm china decisions that could have different implications for us and mgm china including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with mgm china may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 can be found in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” on february 26 2021 

description of our business and key performance indicators 

our primary business is the operation of casino resorts which offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development repay debt financings and return capital to our shareholders we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities 

our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions far east baccarat volumes the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and lunar new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results 

financial impact of covid19 

the spread of covid19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter in march 2020 all of our domestic properties were temporarily closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of covid19 throughout the second and third quarters of 2020 all of our properties that were temporarily closed reopened to the public with temporary reclosures and reopenings occurring for certain of our properties or portions thereof into the first quarter of 2021 upon reopening the properties continued to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations with restrictions varying by jurisdiction beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021 our domestic jurisdictions eased and removed prior operating restrictions including capacity and occupancy limits as well as social distancing policies 

although all of our properties have reopened in light of the unpredictable nature of the pandemic including the emergence and spread of covid19 variants the properties may be subject to new operating restrictions andor temporary complete or partial shutdowns in the future at this time we cannot predict whether jurisdictions states or the federal government will adopt similar or more restrictive measures in the future than in the past including stayathome orders or the temporary closure of all or a portion of our properties as a result of the pandemic 

in macau following a temporary closure of our properties on february 5 2020 operations resumed on february 20 2020 subject to certain health safeguards such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game slot machine spacing reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars temperature checks and mask protection although the issuance of tourist visas including the individual visit scheme for residents of zhuhai guangdong province and all other provinces in mainland china to travel to macau resumed on august 12 2020 august 26 2020 and september 23 2020 respectively several travel and entry restrictions in macau hong kong and mainland china remain in place including the temporary suspension of ferry services between hong kong and macau the negative nucleic acid test result certificate and mandatory quarantine requirements for returning residents for visitors from hong kong taiwan and 

mainland china and bans on entry on other visitors which significantly impacted visitation to our macau properties in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 local covid19 cases were identified in macau upon such occurrences a state of immediate prevention was declared and mass mandatory nucleic acid testing was imposed in macau the validity period of negative test results for reentry into mainland china was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed certain events were cancelled or suspended and in some instances certain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout macau although gaming and hotel operations have remained open during these states of immediate prevention such measures have had a negative effect on our operations and it is uncertain whether further closures including the closure of our properties or travel restrictions to macau will be implemented if additional local covid19 cases are identified 

the las vegas strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends during the year ended december 31 2021 las vegas visitor volume increased 69 compared to the prior year period according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority the las vegas market has had the addition of new sporting events and venues the expansion of convention centers as well as music and entertainment events which have positively impacted visitation along with the easing of covid19 related restrictions as discussed above 

the mgm china segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends during the year ended december 31 2021 macau visitor arrivals increased 31 compared to the prior year period according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government as the prior year period was more negatively affected by travel and entry restrictions in macau than in the current year period

key performance indicators 

key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are

the following table summarizes information related to our share of operating income from unconsolidated affiliates 



in september 2021 we completed the acquisition of the 50 ownership interest in citycenter held by infinity world and now own 100 of the equity interest in citycenter accordingly we no longer account for our interest in citycenter under the equity method of accounting and we now consolidate citycenter in our financial statements 

in june 2021 citycenter closed the sale of its harmon land for 80 million on which it recorded a 30 million gain we recorded a 50 million gain which included 15 million of our 50 share of the gain recorded by citycenter and 35 million representing the reversal of certain basis differences in 2021 

our share of citycenter’s operating income including certain basis difference adjustments was 128 million for the current year period through september 26 2021 compared to our share of citycenters operating loss of 30 million in 2020 due primarily to the temporary property closures in the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions an increase in travel beginning primarily in the second quarter of the current year and the gain related to the sale of its harmon land in the current year as discussed above partially offset by a shorter comparative period in the current year given that as of september 2021 we no longer account for our interest in citycenter under the equity method of accounting as discussed above 

nonoperating results 

interest expense the following table summarizes information related to interest expense net 



gross interest expense was 800 million in 2021 compared to 679 million in 2020 the increase in gross interest expense was due primarily to an increase in average debt outstanding related to senior notes due to the issuances by us the operating partnership and mgm china in 2020 and 2021 partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of the senior notes see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on longterm debt and see “liquidity and capital resources” for additional discussion on issuances and repayments of longterm debt and other sources and uses of cash

income taxes the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 



our effective rate for 2021 was favorably impacted by the permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on consolidation of citycenter partially offset by the unfavorable impact of losses in macau that we could not benefit the effective rate for 2020 was unfavorably impacted by losses in macau that we could not benefit and adjustments to valuation allowances for macau deferred tax assets and foreign tax credits partially offset by tax benefit resulting from carrying back net operating losses to tax years with a higher tax rate than is currently in effect 

cash taxes paid increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in federal income taxes paid resulting from increased us taxable income following the recovery of the business from the impacts of covid19 

reportable segment gaap measure 

“adjusted property ebitdar” is our reportable segment gaap measure which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments adjusted property ebitdar is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses gain on reit transactions net restructuring costs which represents costs related to severance accelerated stock compensation expense and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the mgm 2020 plan rent expense associated with triplenet operating and ground leases income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures property transactions net and also excludes gain on consolidation of citycenter net gain related to citycenters sale of harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates and corporate expense which includes ceo transition expense and october 1 litigation settlement and stock compensation expense which are not allocated to each operating segment and rent expense related to the master lease with mgp that eliminates in consolidation we manage capital allocation tax planning stock compensation and financing decisions at the corporate level “adjusted property ebitdar margin” is adjusted property ebitdar divided by related segment net revenues 

nongaap measure 

“adjusted ebitdar” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses property transactions net gain on reit transactions net gain on consolidation of citycenter net ceo transition expense october 1 litigation settlement restructuring costs which represents costs related to severance accelerated stock compensation expense and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the mgm 2020 plan rent expense associated with triplenet operating and ground leases gain related to citycenters sale of harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures 

adjusted ebitdar information is a valuation metric should not be used as an operating metric and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts lenders financial institutions and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitdar may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period however as discussed herein adjusted ebitdar should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income because this measure is not 

presented on a gaap basis and exclude certain expenses including the rent expense associated with our triplenet operating and ground leases and are provided for the limited purposes discussed herein 

adjusted ebitdar should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with gaap we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes real estate triplenet lease and ground lease payments and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitdar also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitdar information may calculate adjusted ebitdar in a different manner and such differences may be material 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to mgm resorts international to adjusted ebitdar

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows – summary 

our cash flows consisted of the following 



cash flows 

operating activities trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income excluding noncash charges but can be affected by changes in working capital the timing of significant interest payments tax payments or refunds and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates  cash provided by operating activities was 14 billion in 2021 compared to cash used in operating activities of 15 billion in 2020 the change from the prior year was due primarily to the increase in adjusted property ebitdar discussed within the results of operations section above and due to the prior year being negatively affected by a change in working capital related to gaming and nongaming deposits gaming taxes and other gaming liabilities and payroll related liabilities as a result of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by an increase in triplenet lease rent payments and cash paid for interest and taxes 

investing activities our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts business acquisitions or dispositions and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms

other factors affecting liquidity and anticipated uses of cash 

as previously discussed the spread of covid19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter  we require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts 

in addition to required cash on hand for operations we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility in addition from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and delaware law as applicable we have significant outstanding debt interest payments rent payments and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments including acquiring the operations of the cosmopolitan for cash consideration of 1625 billion as discussed further in note 1  

as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 47 billion of which mgm china held 399 million and the operating partnership held 8 million in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balance we have significant holdings a 415 economic interest in mgp refer to note 1 for discussion on our agreement entered into in august 2021 regarding the vici transaction and an approximate 56 interest in mgm china 

at december 31 2021 we had 129 billion in principal amount of indebtedness including 360 million outstanding under the 125 billion mgm china first revolving credit facility and 50 million outstanding under the 135 billion operating partnership revolving credit facility no amounts were drawn on our 1675 billion revolving credit facility or the 400 million mgm china second revolving credit facility we have 10 billion of debt maturing in the next twelve months which we expect to repay with cash on hand 

due to the continued impact of the covid19 pandemic in february 2021 mgm china further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility to provide for waivers of the maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio through the fourth quarter of 2022 in february 2022 mgm china further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility to extend the financial covenant waivers through maturity 

as of december 31 2021 our expected cash interest payments excluding mgp and mgm china for 2022 2023 and 2024 are approximately 300 million 225 million and 190 million respectively and our expected cash interest payments on a consolidated basis which includes mgp if the vici transaction does not close and mgm china for 2022 2023 and 2024 are approximately 715 million 625 million and 585 million respectively we are also required as of december 31 2021 to make annual cash rent payments of 16 billion in the aggregate under the triplenet lease agreements which leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease including real estate taxes ground lease payments insurance utilities and routine maintenance in addition to the annual cash rent 

we have planned capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately 775 million to 815 million domestically and approximately 110 million to 130 million at mgm china which is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triplenet lease agreements each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the respective properties on capital expenditures we additionally have planned contributions to betmgm in 2022 of approximately 225 million 

we also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our february 2020 30 billion share repurchase program subsequent to december 31 2021 we repurchased approximately 15 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 4388 per share for an aggregate amount of 670 million  repurchased shares were retired 

in january 2022 the operating partnership paid 141 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders of which we received 59 million and mgp received 82 million which mgp concurrently paid as a dividend to its class a shareholders 

on february 9 2022  our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 00025 per share the dividend will be payable on march 15 2022 to holders of record on march 10 2022  future determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on thenexisting conditions including our results of operations financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant  

as previously discussed the covid19 pandemic has caused and is continuing to cause significant economic disruption both globally and in the united states and impacted our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows i n 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter  as widespread vaccine distribution continues and operational restrictions have been removed we have seen economic recovery in some of the market segments in which we operate as shown in our summary operating results however some areas continue to experience renewed outbreaks and surges in infection rates as a result our business segments continue to face many uncertainties and our operations remain vulnerable to reversal of these trends or other continuing negative effects caused by 

the pandemic we cannot predict the degree or duration to which our operations will be affected by the covid19 pandemic and the effects could be material we continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities including federal state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations in these circumstances there may be developments outside our control requiring us to further adjust our operating plan including the implementation or extension of new or existing restrictions which may include the reinstatement of stayathome orders in the jurisdictions in which we operate or additional restrictions on travel andor our business operations because the situation is ongoing and because the duration and severity remain unclear it is difficult to forecast any impacts on our future results

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where the estimates and assumptions involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates 

loss reserve for casino accounts receivable 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and historically to gaming promoters we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the united states mgm china performs background checks and investigates credit worthiness prior to issuing credit refer to note 2 for further discussion of our casino receivables and those due from customers residing in foreign countries 

we maintain a loss reserve for casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the loss reserve we regularly evaluate the loss reserve for casino accounts at domestic resorts where marker play is not significant the loss reserve is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances which is supported by relevant historical analysis and any other known information such as the current economic conditions that could drive losses at domestic resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s current and expected future financial condition collection history and current and expected future economic conditions mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account the financial condition and the collection history of the customer or historically the gaming promoter 

in addition to enforceability issues the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the loss reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables net of discounts 



approximately 63 million and 54 million of casino receivables and 31 million and 18 million of the loss reserve for casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased in the current year due to a decrease in specific reserves at our domestic resorts as well as the i nclusion of aria in the current year which had a lower loss reserve compared to our other domestic resorts due to the age of its outstanding receivables partially offset by an increase in the loss reserve at mgm china primarily due to an increase in its specific reserves at december 31 2021 a 100 basispoint change in the loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 4 million 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

property and equipment are stated at cost a significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin during 2019 we recorded a noncash impairment charge relating to the carrying value of circus circus las vegas and adjacent land refer to note 16 for further discussion 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks for our 2021 annual impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a qualitative “step zero” analysis for certain of our indefinitelived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin we elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the mgm northfield park gaming license in 2021 primarily using the discounted cash flow approach for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in an impairment charge 

we review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2021 for our 2021 annual impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of multiples capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

see note 2 and note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of otherthantemporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates during 2021 and 2020 we recorded 22 million and 64 million respectively in otherthantemporary impairment charges on equity method investments refer to note 6 for further discussion our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had no material impairments in 2019 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to net operating losses tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences with future tax consequences we reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized accordingly the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on such morelikelythannot realization threshold this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities the duration of statutory carryforward periods and tax planning strategies 

we recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our domestic jurisdictions of 27 billion as of both december 31 2021 and 2020 and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of foreign jurisdictions of 149 million and 156 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to 

realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

furthermore we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows 

refer to note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the operating partnership’s credit facility a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions  

as of december 31 2021 variable rate borrowings represented approximately 3 of our total borrowings after giving effect on the operating partnership’s borrowings for the currently effective interest rate swap agreements on which the operating partnership pays a weighted average of 1783 on a total notional amount of 700 million additionally the operating partnership has 900 million of notional amount of forward starting swaps that are not currently effective the following table provides additional information about the maturities of our debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above 



in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and mgm cotai while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states china macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the us dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof for us dollar denominated debt incurred by mgm china fluctuations in the exchange rates of the hong kong dollar in relation to the us dollar could have adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations as of december 31 2021 a 1 weakening of the hong kong dollar the functional currency of mgm china to the us dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of 28 million

financial impact of covid19 the spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus “covid19” and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had and we expect will continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in 2021 in march 2020 all of our domestic properties temporarily closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of covid19 throughout the second and third quarters of 2020 all of our properties reopened to the public but continue to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations with restrictions varying by jurisdiction and with further temporary reclosures and reopenings occurring for our properties or portions of our properties into the first quarter of 2021 in response to reduced demand we temporarily closed the hotel tower operations at mandalay bay and park mgm midweek and temporarily closed the mirage midweek  which are expected to resume full week operations on march 3 2021  accordingly our properties have continued to generate revenues that are significantly lower than historical results in addition as a result of the continued impact of the covid19 pandemic and the emergence of variant strains our properties may be subject to temporary complete or partial shutdowns in the future at this time we cannot predict whether the jurisdictions in which our properties are located states or the federal government will continue to impose operating restrictions on us or adopt similar or more restrictive measures in the future including stayathome orders or ordering the temporary closures of all or a portion of our 

 

properties we have implemented certain measures to mitigate the spread of covid19 including limit ations on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and on the number of seats at each table game as well as slot machine spacing temperature checks mask protection limitations on restaurant capacity entertainment events and conventions as well as other measures to enforce social distancing in addition f ollowing a temporary closure of our properties in macau on february 5 2020 operations resumed on february 20 2020 subject to certain health safeguards such as limiting the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and the number of seats available at each table game slot machine spacing reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars temperature checks mask protection and the need to present negative covid19 test results and health declarations submitted through the macau health code system which remain in effect effective july 15 2020 all guests entering our casinos were required to provide a negative nucleic acid test result with a valid ‘green’ macau health code although the issuance of tourist visas including the individual visa scheme “ivs”  for residents of zhuhai guangdong province and all other provinces in mainland china to travel to macau resumed on august 12 2020 august 26 2020 and september 23 2020 respectively several travel and entry restrictions in macau hong kong and mainland china remain in place including the temporary suspension of ferry services from hong kong to macau the nucleic acid test result certificate and mandatory quarantine requirements for visitors from hong kong and taiwan  and bans on entry or enhanced quarantine requirements on other visitors into macau  which have significantly impact ed visitation to our macau properties  

 

while we have engaged in aggressive cost reduction efforts to minimize cash outflows while our properties were initially closed and have continued to engage in such efforts as the properties have reopened we still have significant fixed and variable expenses which have and will continue to adversely affect our profitability in addition we have seen and expect to continue to see weakened demand at our properties as a result of continued domestic and international travel restrictions or warnings restrictions on amenity use such as gaming restaurant and pool capacity limitations consumer fears and reduced consumer discretionary spending general economic uncertainty and increased rates of unemployment in light of the foregoing we are unable to determine when our properties will return to prepandemic demand and pricing or if our properties will remain reopened the covid19 pandemic has had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2020 and we expect that it will continue to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2021 and potentially thereafter

 

resort operations 

 

general 

 

most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development acquisitions or investments and repay debt financings

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts except as otherwise described related to the impact of covid19 typically operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of empire city casino which operates 20 hours a day every day of the year though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions far east baccarat volumes the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and lunar new year our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we also lease space to third party retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities

 

as of december 31 2020 we have three reportable segments las vegas strip resorts regional operations and mgm china 

 

las vegas strip resorts and regional operations

las vegas strip resorts las vegas strip resorts consists of the following casino resorts bellagio mgm grand las vegas including the signature mandalay bay including delano and four seasons the mirage luxor new yorknew york including the park excalibur park mgm including nomad las vegas and circus circus las vegas until the sale of such property in december 2019 

regional operations regional operations consists of the following casino resorts mgm grand detroit in detroit michigan beau rivage in biloxi mississippi gold strike tunica in tunica mississippi borgata in atlantic city new jersey mgm national harbor in prince george’s county maryland mgm springfield in springfield massachusetts empire city in yonkers new york upon its acquisition in january 2019 and mgm northfield park in northfield park ohio upon mgm’s acquisition of the operations from mgp in april 2019 

 

 

over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is typically derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities although we have been operating without certain amenities and subject to certain limitations as a result of the covid19 pandemic  our longterm strategy is to market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties  which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 

 

our casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games and through betmgm we offer online sports betting and igaming in certain jurisdictions in the united states in addition we provide our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere 

 

mgm china

 

we own approximately 56 of mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise sa “mgm grand paradise” the macau company that owns and operates the mgm macau and mgm cotai casino resorts and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability although visitation during 2020 was significantly reduced by the covid19 pandemic we expect the longterm future growth of the asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at mgm macau and mgm cotai

 

our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and mgm cotai discussed further below mgm china’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau sa which expires in 2022 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos or gaming areas require government approval prior to commencing operations see “risk factors — risks related to our business — the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession or refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022 any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows”

 

corporate and other 

 

we have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate and management operations our unconsolidated affiliates include the ventures with breit discussed elsewhere betmgm and citycenter holdings llc “citycenter” which we also manage for a fee among others

customers and competition 

 

our properties operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors igaming and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally for further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business see “risk factors — risks related to our business — we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow”

 

our primary methods of successful competition include











 

las vegas strip resorts and regional operations

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the las vegas strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in las vegas also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas

 

outside nevada our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region 

 

mgm china

 

the three primary customer bases in the macau gaming market are vip gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who assist vip players with their travel and entertainment arrangements gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements and rolling chip turnoverbased commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor gaming operations exceeds the vip gaming operations due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters we offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players’ use as well as nongaming amenities such as the mansion to attract ultrahigh end customers 

 

vip gaming at mgm china is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips and in turn they sell these chips to their players the nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate they also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate which can be applied to hotel rooms food and beverage and other discretionary customerrelated expenses gaming promoter commissions are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue 

our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally we face competition at our macau and cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations primarily on the cotai strip

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below

 

summary of risk factors

 

the following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results

 

risks relating to our substantial indebtedness

 









risks related to our business

 

























 

















































for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business please see below

 

 

risks relating to our substantial indebtedness 

 

our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide of the indebtedness of the bellagio breit venture and the mgp breit venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations  as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 125 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis including 42 billion of outstanding indebtedness of the operating partnership and 28 billion of outstanding indebtedness of mgm china any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs we do not guarantee mgm china’s or the operating partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and to the extent mgm china or the operating partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness our ability to make additional investments into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility 

 

in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us including











 

we currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the 301 billion and 30 billion principal amount of indebtedness and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon of the bellagio breit venture and mgp breit venture respectively the terms of each guarantee provide that after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation which amount may be material and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future if we do not have sufficient cash on hand we may need to raise capital including incurring additional indebtedness in order to satisfy our obligation there can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available will be on terms that are satisfactory to us

 

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished our leases with mgp the bellagio breit venture and the mgp breit venture have fixed rental payments with annual escalators and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly development projects including any potential future development of an integrated resort in japan strategic initiatives including positioning betmgm as a leader in online sports betting and igaming and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

finally our senior credit facility calculates interest on outstanding balances using the london interbank offered rate “libor” on july 27 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fca announced it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 although our senior credit facility includes libor replacement provisions that contemplate an alternate benchmark rate to be mutually agreed upon by us and the administrative agent if necessary any such changes may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made if libor was available in its current form as a result there can be no assurance that discontinuation of libor will not result in significant increases in benchmark interest rates substantially higher financing costs or a shortage of available debt financing any of which could have an adverse effect on us

 

current and future economic capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments or make planned expenditures  our ability to make payments on our substantial indebtedness and other significant financial commitments including the rent payments under our leases and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and other investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates including citycenter and subsidiaries including mgm china and the operating partnership and borrow under our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant deterioration to regional national and international economic conditions which has resulted in substantial declines in our revenues from our operations and expected distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries we expect that the pandemic will continue to impact consumer spending levels in 2021 and potentially thereafter and if we fail to generate cash sufficient to fund our liquidity 

 

needs or satisfy the financial and other covenants in our debt and lease instruments  we cannot assure you that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional debt on terms favorable to us or at all 

 

in addition we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2022 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements or leases 

 

the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations  covenants governing our senior credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict among other things our ability to 

 















 

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger crossdefaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness in april of 2020 we entered into an amendment to our senior secured credit facility to waive the rent adjusted net leverage and interest coverage covenants through but excluding the second quarter of 2021 and adjust the required leverage and interest coverage levels for the covenant when it is reimposed at the end of the waiver period in february 2021 we further amended the senior secured credit facility to extend the covenant relief period through but excluding the second quarter of 2022 and adjust the required leverage and interest coverage levels for the covenant when it is reimposed at the end of the waiver period any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial commitments

 

in addition each of mgm china and the operating partnership has issued debt securities and is a borrower under credit facilities all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions require them to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries these restrictions include among other things limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets 

 

we are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth initiatives service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes  as of december 31 2020 we are required to make annual rent payments of 828 million under the master lease with mgp annual rent payments of 250 million under the lease with bellagio breit venture and annual rent payments of 292 million under the lease with mgp breit venture which leases are also subject to annual escalators as described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the leases also require us to spend a certain amount on capital expenditures at the leased properties in addition the leases governing the bellagio mgm grand las vegas and mandalay bay properties require us to comply with certain financial covenants which if not met will require us to deposit cash collateral or issue letters of credit for the benefit of the applicable landlord equal to one year of rent under the mgm grand las vegas and mandalay bay lease and two years of rent under the bellagio lease as a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditure obligations our ability to fund our operations raise capital make acquisitions make investments service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected for example our obligations under the leases may 







 







 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

risks related to our business

 

the global covid19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business financial results and liquidity and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time the global spread of the covid19 pandemic has been and continues to be complex and rapidly evolving with governments public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending and businesses and individuals implementing restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation stayathome directives limitations on the size of gatherings closures of work facilities schools public buildings and businesses cancellation of events including sporting events concerts conferences and meetings and quarantines and lockdowns 

 

the covid19 pandemic and its consequences have dramatically reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms and other casino resort amenities which has had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 and which we expect to impact our consolidated results of operations during 2021 and potentially thereafter in particular although all of our properties are open to the public they were all required to be fully closed for some periods of time during 2020 pursuant to various state and local government regulations which had a negative impact on our results of operations during this period in addition in light of the recent significant increases in reported cases of covid19 across the country as well as the emergence of variant strains additional restrictions have been imposed in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate including setting curfews and imposing restrictions on hotel and restaurant operations in light of the continued impact of the pandemic on midweek visitation the company determined to temporarily close the hotel tower operations at mandalay bay and park mgm midweek and determined to temporarily close the mirage midweek which are expected to resume full week operations on march 3 2021 further our properties are continuing to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations and we are unable to predict the length of time it will take for our properties to return to normal operations or if our properties or portions of our properties will be required to close again due to the covid19 pandemic and the emergence of variant strains of the virus see “—although all of our properties have reopened to the public they are operating without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations and we are unable to predict the length of time it will take for our properties to return to normal operations or if such properties will be required to close again due to the covid19 pandemic”

following a temporary closure of mgm china’s properties in macau on february 5 2020 operations resumed on february 20 2020 subject to certain health safeguards such as limiting the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and the number of seats available at each table game slot machine spacing reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars temperature checks mask protection and the need to present negative covid19 test results and health declarations submitted through the macau health code system which remain in effect effective july 15 2020 all guests entering our casinos were required to provide a negative nucleic acid test result with a valid ‘green’ macau health code although the issuance of tourist visas including the ivs for residents of zhuhai guangdong province and all other provinces in mainland china to travel to macau resumed on august 12 2020 august 26 2020 and september 23 2020 respectively several travel and entry restrictions in macau hong kong and mainland china remain in place including the temporary suspension of ferry services from hong kong to macau the nucleic acid test result certificate and mandatory quarantine requirements for visitors from hong kong and taiwan and bans on entry or enhanced quarantine requirements on other visitors into macau as a result of the foregoing the covid19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on mgm china’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 and will likely continue to negatively impact mgm china’s results of operations in 2021 given the uncertainty of the length of time of the pandemic the emergence of variant strains of the virus and the continuation of operating restrictions and other limitations on visitation

 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations and financial results including the duration and magnitude of such effects will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess including the duration and scope of the pandemic and whether there is a or multiple resurgences in the future the availability of a vaccine and the efficacy of the vaccine against existing and new variants of the covid19 virus the ability to effectively and efficiently distribute any vaccines domestically and internationally to allow travel to resume to prepandemic levels the negative impact the pandemic has on global and regional economies and economic activity including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending its short and longerterm impact on the demand for travel transient and group business and levels of consumer confidence even after travel advisories and restrictions are lifted the ability of us and our business partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic actions governments businesses and individuals take 

 

in response to the pandemic including the rise of variant strains of the virus  such as limiting or banning travel and limiting or banning leisure casino and entertainment including sporting events activities and how quickly economies travel activity and demand for gaming entertainment and leisure activities recovers after the pandemic subsides we may also face unforeseen liability or be subject to additional obligations as a result of the covid19 pandemic including as a result of claims alleging exposure to covid19 in connection with our operations or facilities or to the extent we are subject to a governmental enforcement action as a result of health and safety compliance the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described in this section or in any other filings with the sec  as a result of the foregoing we cannot predict the ultimate scope duration and impact the covid19 pandemic will have on our results of operations but it will continue to have a material impact on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations including revenues and profitability and stock price 

 

in addition while we expect to benefit from certain payroll tax and income tax relief provided under the cares act we have not applied for any of the other available benefits although we may do so in the future to the extent such benefits remain available or new benefits become available if we were to apply for such benefits we cannot predict the manner in which such benefits would be allocated or administered and we cannot assure you that we will be able to access such benefits in a timely manner or at all certain of the benefits we may seek to access under the cares act have not previously been administered on the present scale or at all government or third party program administrators may be unable to cope with the volume of applications in the near term and any benefits we receive may not be as extensive as those for which we may apply may impose additional conditions and restrictions on our operations or may otherwise provide less relief than we contemplate if the us government or any other governmental authority agrees to provide crisis relief assistance that we accept it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid including restrictions on executive officer compensation dividends prepayment of debt limitations on debt and other similar restrictions that will apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full we cannot assure you that any such government crisis relief assistance will not significantly limit our corporate activities or be on terms that are favorable to us such restrictions and terms could adversely impact our business and operations

 

although all of our properties are open to the public they are operating without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations and we are unable to predict the length of time it will take for our properties to return to normal operations or if such properties will be required to close again due to the covid19 pandemic as of the date of this filing all of our properties are open or expected to be open to the public but are operating without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations including midweek hotel tower closures at mandalay bay and park mgm and the full midweek closure of the mirage which are expected to resume full week operations on march 3 2021 accordingly although our properties are open they are generating revenues that are significantly lower than historical results in addition our properties may be subject to temporary complete or partial shutdowns in the future due to covid19 related concerns we have also implemented certain measures to mitigate the spread of covid19 including limits on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and on the number of seats at each table game as well as slot machine spacing temperature checks mask protection limitations on restaurant capacity entertainment events and conventions and other measures to enforce social distancing while we engaged in aggressive cost reduction efforts to minimize cash outflows while our properties were closed and have continued to engage in such efforts as our properties have reopened we still have significant fixed and variable expenses which will adversely affect our profitability in addition we have seen and continue to expect to see weakened demand at our properties as a result of continued domestic and international travel restrictions or warnings restrictions on amenity use such as gaming restaurant and pool capacity limitations consumer fears and reduced consumer discretionary spending general economic uncertainty and increased rates of unemployment we also lease certain of our outlets to third parties that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic and there can be no assurance that these third parties will be able to pay rent or other obligations owed to us or continue to operate at our properties when we return to normalized operations if we provide financial relief to existing tenants to assist them with continuing operations fail to relet these properties or if we are able to relet these properties on terms which are not as favorable to us as in our previous leases our results of operations may be negatively impacted in light of the foregoing we are unable to determine when our properties will return to prepandemic demand or pricing but the impact had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2020 and we expect that it will continue to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2021 and potentially thereafter 

 

we have undertaken aggressive actions to reduce costs and improve efficiencies to mitigate losses as a result of the covid19 pandemic which could negatively impact guest loyalty and our ability to attract and retain employees as a result of the temporary closures of all of our domestic properties the continued limitations on amenities offered at the properties and the continued uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of this pandemic we have taken steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies including substantial furloughs which have resulted in a number of employees being separated from the company and headcount reductions such steps and further changes we may make in the future to reduce costs may negatively impact guest loyalty or our ability to attract and retain employees and our reputation may suffer as a result we may also face demands or requests from labor unions that represent our employees whether in the course of our periodic renegotiation of our collective bargaining agreements through effects bargaining relating to the shut down andor reopening of our operations or otherwise for additional compensation healthcare benefits or other terms as a result of covid19 that could increase costs and we could experience labor disputes or disruptions as we continue to implement our covid19 mitigation plans 

 

  

we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete including increased competition through online sports betting and igaming and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  the hotel resort entertainment and casino industries are highly competitive we do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area and hotel resort entertainment and gaming operations in other states or countries as well as the increased availability of online sports betting and igaming could attract our customers to the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations competition will increase major competitors including potential new entrants may also expand their hotel room capacity expand their range of amenities improve their level of service or construct new resorts in las vegas macau or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate all of which could attract our customers also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas and elsewhere for instance recently local referendums were passed to allow gaming in virginia and nebraska with active lobbying occurring in additional states while we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peertopeer inventory sources which allow travelers to book shortterm rentals of homes and apartments from owners we expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution innovations in consumerfacing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business 

 

we have also seen significant expansion across the united states in legalized forms of igaming and online sports betting and expect additional jurisdictions will likely legalize igaming and online sports betting in the future we participate in the domestic igaming and online sports betting market through our joint venture betmgm which faces significant competition from other industry participants as well as the broader gaming and entertainment industries if betmgm is unable to sustain or grow interest in its offerings it may not be able to gain the scale necessary to successfully compete in the growing market and as a result we may not receive the anticipated benefits from our investment in addition the expansion of igaming online sports betting and other types of gaming may further compete with our landbased operations by reducing customer visitation and spend at our properties

 

in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including japan and others such as taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or igaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities we would face increased competition 

 

most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise 

 

in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations  our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries states and provinces in which we operate these laws regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally concern the responsibility financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations as such our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or alternatively cease operations in that jurisdiction in addition unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations furthermore our igaming and online sports betting initiatives may be particularly subject to risks related to potential changes in the regulatory environment as a result of the continued development of regulations in this industry for example in 2018 the us department of justice “doj” reversed its previouslyissued opinion published in 2011 which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the wire act of 1961 “wire act” the doj’s updated opinion concluded instead that the wire act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to nonsportsrelated wagering activity in june 2019 a federal district court in new hampshire ruled that the doj’s new interpretation of the wire act was erroneous and vacated doj’s new 

 

opinion doj has appealed the decision of the district court to the us court of appeals for the first circuit an adverse ruling in the court of appeals or other disposition of the case may impact our ability to engage in ig aming in the future for a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business see “regulation and licensing” and exhibit 99 1 to this annual report on form 10k  

 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the property state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards certain public and private issuances of securities borrowings under credit agreements guarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities

 

macau laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm china’s interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm china’s activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues

 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the energy policy act the safe drinking water act renewable portfolio standards the oil pollution act of 1990 and many others under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted in addition effective january 1 2019 smoking in casinos in macau including mgm macau and mgm cotai is only permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms rather than outside smoking areas or vip areas the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance

 

we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations for instance we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970 commonly known as the “bank secrecy act” which among other things requires us to report to the internal revenue service “irs” any currency transactions in excess of 10000 that occur within a 24hour gaming day including identification of the individuals involved in the currency transaction we are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know suspect or have reason to suspect transactions among other things involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose in addition under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting recordkeeping and retention our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic examinations by the irs any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws including the bank secrecy act or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 

furthermore the covid19 pandemic has resulted in governments public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread see “—the global covid19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business financial results and liquidity and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time” in addition to the pandemicrelated restrictions that resulted in the temporary closures of our properties during 2020 governmental or other covid19related restrictions may be extended or new restrictions may be imposed in the future

 

our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside  our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions trade shows and business development economic contraction economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels casino resorts trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer in addition changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel an unstable job market perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other acts of violence consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors including demographic changes which for instance have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for nongaming offerings our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the 

 

preferences of consumers and timely react to these trends and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations in particular aria bellagio and mgm grand las vegas may be affected by economic conditions in the far east and all of our nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the united states and california in particular a recession economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts which would adversely affect our operating results 

 

for example i n march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic as a result of its spread and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of the outbreak including the temporary suspension of gaming operations in macau in february 2020 and the temporary closures of all of our domestic properties at times during 2020 as of the date hereof while all of our properties are open to the public they are operating without all amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations and accordingly continue to generate revenues that are significantly lower than historical results the full extent to which covid19 impacts our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted see “—the global covid19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business financial results and liquidity and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time”

 

in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau and mgm cotai and to a lesser extent our domestic properties from mainland china general economic regulatory and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements including continued market impacts of the covid19 outbreak and market impacts resulting from china’s recent anticorruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by nonbank lending entities and crossborder currency monitoring including increased restrictions on union pay withdrawals and other atm limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china andor the amounts they are willing to spend at our properties most recently in july 2017 the chinese government along with macau authorities implemented new facial recognition technology on atm machines in macau to strictly enforce the “know you r customer” regulations for mainland chinese bank cardholders and in november 2017 new rules were adopted to control the crossborder transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau

furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of the opening of new developments in macau while we seek employees from outside of macau to adequately staff our resorts certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications for instance the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase including limitations on our ability to import labor as a result of temporary travel restrictions adopted as part of the covid19 mitigation efforts finally because additional casino projects have commenced operations and other projects are under construction the existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our developments in macau could be negatively impacted

 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives including those associated with our mgm 2020 plan as part of our mgm 2020 plan we undertook several initiatives to reduce costs and further position us for growth by the end of 2020 in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic we implemented several additional cost savings initiatives in 2020 to improve our operating model however we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all that we will ultimately be able to realize the expected benefits of these or any other cost savings initiatives or that any new additional costs or increases in existing expenses will not offset any cost savings if we fail to achieve the anticipated benefits of any current or future cost savings initiatives our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted furthermore as the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business continues to evolve we may need to adjust or expand our cost savings initiatives which could have the effect of exacerbating the risks described above 

 

the anticipated benefits of our asset light strategy including the bellagio saleleaseback transaction and mgp breit venture transaction may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all   our current growth strategy is to pursue and execute on an assetlight business model which involves a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to determine whether those assets can be monetized efficiently to allow unlocked capital to be redeployed towards balance sheet improvements new growth opportunities and to return value to our shareholders our ability to execute on this strategy will depend on our ability to identify accretive transactions that optimize the value of our remaining assets there can be no assurances however that we will be able to monetize our remaining real property assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that any anticipated benefits from any such potential transactions will be realized 

 

 

our ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements as part of our cost savings initiatives during the pandemic we significantly reduced our historic dividend rate although we intend to pay ongoing regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock our board of directors may in its sole discretion change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely in addition our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in our credit agreement and because we are a holding company with no material direct operations we are dependent on receiving cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock our subsidiaries ability to generate the cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock is be subject to their operating results cash requirements and financial condition which has been significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic in addition our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us is subject to any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds available to us and compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties in addition each of the companies in our corporate chain must manage its assets liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions future dividend payments may be further reduced or eliminated in their entirety any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

nearly all of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property including risks relating to lease termination lease extensions charges and our relationship with the lessor which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations nearly all of our properties are subject to triplenet leases that in addition to rent require us to pay 1 all facility maintenance 2 all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 3 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on the income of the lessor 4 all capital expenditures and 5 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties we are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities furthermore our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant such as certain events of casualty and condemnation 

 

in addition under the master lease with mgp if some of our facilities should prove to be unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations or if we should otherwise decide to exit a particular property we would remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations even if we decided to cease operations at those locations unless we are able to transfer the rights with respect to a particular property in accordance with the requirements of the mgp master lease furthermore our ability to transfer our obligations under the mgp master lease to a thirdparty with respect to individual properties should we decide to withdraw from a particular location is limited to nonlas vegas properties and no more than two las vegas gaming properties and is subject to identifying a willing thirdparty who meets the requirements for a transferee set forth in the mgp master lease which we may be unable to find in addition we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including sublease termination costs impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

paul salem our chairman daniel j taylor one of our directors and corey sanders and john m mcmanus members of our senior management may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at mgp  paul salem serves as our chairman and as the chairman of mgp in addition daniel j taylor one of our directors is also a director of mgp and corey sanders and john m mcmanus members of our senior management are also directors of mgp while we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational documents with respect to mgp contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties including fiduciary duties to any mgp shareholder to the fullest extent permitted by law these overlapping positions could nonetheless create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when our or mgp’s management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities such as potential acquisition targets or face decisions that could have different implications for us and mgp further potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and mgp or its subsidiaries regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship between us and mgp such as under the master lease potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and mgp enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future 

 

despite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of mgp as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding class b share of mgp mgp has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us including transactions involving consideration in excess of 25 million must be approved in accordance with certain specified procedures which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives   we own the single outstanding class b share of mgp the class b share is a noneconomic interest in mgp which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from 

 

operations of mgp or upon liquidation or winding up of mgp and which represents a majority of the voting power of mgp’s shares so long as the holder of the class b share and its controlled affiliates’ excluding mgp aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in mgp and the operating partnership does not fall below 30 we therefore have the ability to exercise significant control over mgp’s affairs including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to mgp’s shareholders for approval mgp’s operating agreement however provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any resolution or course of action by mgp’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to mgp if it is i approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors which mgp refers to as “special approval” such independence determined in accordance with the nyse’s listing standards the standards established by the exchange act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement ii determined by mgp’s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to mgp or iii approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates furthermore mgp’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value individually or in the aggregate over 25 million between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any such transaction other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of mgp’s formation transactions a “threshold transaction” shall be permitted only if i special approval is obtained or ii such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates as a result certain transactions including   any threshold transactions that we may want to pursue with mgp and that could have significant benefit to us may require special approval there can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from   a conflicts committee comprised of independent mgp directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates the failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our   operational and strategic objectives 

 

we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china  as a result of the extension of the macau gaming subconcession we entered into a first renewed deed of noncompete undertakings with mgm china and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king “ms ho” pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the people’s republic of china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china while gaming is currently prohibited in china hong kong and taiwan if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of i the date mgm china’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on the stock exchange of hong kong limited or ii the date when our ownership of mgm china shares is less than 20 of the thenissued share capital of mgm china 

 

the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise  exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession or refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental noncompliance by mgm grand paradise with applicable macau laws or mgm grand paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such noncompliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the macau government upon such termination all of mgm grand paradise’s casino area premises and gamingrelated equipment would be transferred automatically to the macau government without compensation to mgm grand paradise and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macau government 

 

furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradise’s compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

in addition the subconcession contract expires on june 26 2022 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradise’s casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract 

 

by providing us at least one year’s prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues 

 

mgm grand paradise is dependent upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau  gaming promoters who promote gaming and draw highend customers to casinos are responsible for a significant portion of mgm grand paradise’s gaming revenues in macau with the rise in gaming in macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in macau and in the number of vip rooms operated by licensed gaming promoters the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased while mgm grand paradise is undertaking initiatives to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters in addition continued reductions in and new regulations governing the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure of additional vip rooms in macau including vip rooms at mgm macau and mgm cotai if mgm grand paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters or if gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our highend customers or if as a result of recent market conditions in macau gaming promoters encounter difficulties attracting patrons to come to macau or experience decreased liquidity limiting their ability to grant credit to patrons mgm grand paradise’s ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered furthermore if existing vip rooms at mgm macau and mgm cotai are closed there can be no assurance that mgm grand paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such vip rooms in the future in a timely manner or at all 

 

in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradise’s standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations

 

we also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans

 

the future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxes attributable to potential taxable foreignsourced income in future periods including the recapture of overall domestic losses to the extent of us taxable income we evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered this evaluation is based on all available evidence including assumptions concerning future us operating profits and foreign source income as a result significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change 

 

we are subject to risks related to climate change extreme weather conditions potentially exacerbated by climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business which could harm our business and results of operations certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes floods tornados and winter storms in the united states and severe typhoons in macau such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations or the operations of critical suppliers damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas in addition our operations or the operations of critical suppliers could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate or source critical supplies could adversely affect our business although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions furthermore such extreme weather conditions may result in reduced availability or increased price volatility of certain critical supplies may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period 

 

because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified  given that a significant number of our major resorts are 

 

concentrated on the las vegas strip our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect our business we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand  as a result of limitations on travel imposed to address the covid19 pandemic or otherwise can impact the number of visitors to our resorts additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of our customers reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities 

 

we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables  we conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players and highend players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming and variances in winloss results attributable to highend gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter furthermore the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these highend customers could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant in the opinion of management an extension of credit in addition mgm grand paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers uncollectible receivables from highend customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

 

while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations

 

furthermore we expect that mgm china will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm china gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm china may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm china may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm china remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers

 

even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results

 

we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect our future profits  we review our goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance significant negative trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in writedowns and impairment charges in the past and if one or more of such events occurs in the future additional impairment charges or writedowns may be required in future periods if we are required to record additional impairment charges or writedowns this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 

 

leisure and business travel  especially travel by air  are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events  such as terrorist attacks other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases  we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air since most of our customers travel by air to our las vegas and macau properties any terrorist act or other acts of violence outbreak of hostilities escalation of war or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the outbreak of infectious diseases such as covid19 has severely disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt domestic and international travel the covid19 pandemic has resulted in governments public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending and businesses and individuals implementing restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation stayathome directives limitations on the size of gatherings closures of work facilities schools public buildings and businesses cancellation of events including sporting events concerts conferences and meetings and quarantines and lockdowns although all of our properties are open to the public we are still subject to capacity limitations on the size of gatherings in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate which has had a significant impact on the willingness of our customers to come to our properties for conventions even when those restrictions are removed consumer willingness to attend large scale conferences may be impacted for the foreseeable future due to continued concerns over safety and social distancing see “—the global covid19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business financial results and liquidity and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time” 

 

 

furthermore although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable

 

coinvesting in our properties including our investments in citycenter and betmgm decreases our ability to manage risk  in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly we have from time to time invested and expect to continue to invest in properties or businesses as a coinvestor coinvestors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business therefore the operation of such properties or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters in addition investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the coinvestor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives consequently actions by a coinvestor might subject the properties or businesses owned by such entities to additional risk further we may be unable to take action without the approval of our coinvestors or our coinvestors could take actions binding on the property without our consent additionally should a coinvestor become bankrupt we could become liable for its share of liabilities 

 

for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our coinvestor are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenter’s indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio as defined in citycenter’s credit facility for each quarter which covenants are subject to a waiver through the maturity date of its revolving credit facility in april 2022 we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test

 

in addition we share control of betmgm with entain with all major operating investing and financial activities requiring the consent of both members disagreements between us and entain could arise in the future including with respect to the amount and timing of capital contributions if we and entain are unable to support the future funding of betmgm then betmgm may not have the resources to execute on the development or implementation of its strategies including funding efforts to increase its market share which could result in us not receiving the anticipated benefits from our investment 

 

any of our future construction development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables costs and our ability to complete the projects  

 

any of our future construction development or expansion projects such as our proposed integrated resort in japan will be subject to a number of risks including

 































 

 

the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake in addition the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines and any such deadlines are not extended we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  

 

we also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties including revenue lost while rooms restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service 

 

our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer in addition our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future  although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire natural disasters acts of war or terrorism or other acts of violence each policy has certain exclusions in addition our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events acts of war loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events rolling blackouts or otherwise deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered at all under our policies therefore certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses 

 

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event furthermore the leases we entered into in connection with the mgp breit venture transaction and the bellagio saleleaseback transaction require us to maintain specified insurance coverage we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits of insurance coverage required by these leases and to the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all then we would need to obtain amendments to the leases or face a default by the applicable tenant under the lease which could have material adverse effect on our business

 

we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage

any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or any other similar anticorruption laws could have a negative impact on us  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the united states which exposes us to complex foreign and us regulations inherent in doing crossborder business and in each of the countries in which we transact business we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and other similar anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws by us or our noncontrolled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us and the sec and us department of justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the fcpa the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations

a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations as of december 31 2020 approximately 24000 excluding approximately 10000 furloughed employees of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements a prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services also wage andor benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations to the extent that our nonunion employees seek union representation or elect union representation we would have exposure to risks associated with representation proceedings labor negotiations andor economic impacts of newly negotiated labor agreements furthermore we may have or acquire in the future multiemployer plans that are classified as “endangered” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status for instance borgata’s most significant plan is the legacy plan of the unite here retirement fund which has been listed in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan which may require additional contributions from employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions andor modifications to retiree benefits in addition while borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in 

 

an amount and at such time or over a period of time that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of and after withdrawal any such additional costs may be significant 

 

our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results  we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and therefore higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations accordingly increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results additionally higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues 

 

the failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data we collect and process information relating to our employees guests and others for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted by the various states the united states and other jurisdictions around the world privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent or conflict between jurisdictions various federal state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy data retention data transfer and data protection for example the european union has adopted a data protection regulation known as the general data protection regulation which became fully enforceable in may 2018 that includes operational and compliance requirements with significant penalties for noncompliance in addition california has enacted a new privacy law known as the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which went into effect on january 1 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the united states 

 

compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us including accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly however they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including but not limited to computer malware viruses hacking and phishing attacks by third parties in addition while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event such coverage may not be sufficient  

 

we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyberattacks or otherwise could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations for instance there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed our information systems and data including those we maintain with our thirdparty service providers have been subject to cyber security breaches in the past and may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future in addition our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a thirdparty service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation cause a material disruption to our operations and result in remediation expenses regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers business partners other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance factors and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas including diversity and inclusion community engagement and philanthropy environmental sustainability climate change responsible gaming supply chain management workplace conduct human rights and many others some of which may be unforeseen any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

 

 

we may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets any of which may be unsuccessful  we intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties including mgp acquisitions and investments in businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

 













 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all in addition even if we are able to identify any such opportunities and complete transactions we cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of our acquisitions or that they will be accretive to our results of operations our estimates and assumptions regarding expected synergies and benefits of our acquisitions could materially change including as a result of factors beyond our control and could delay decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions in addition even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs competitive responses loss or customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention and the expansion of our operations in general whether through acquisition development or internal growth could also cause us to incur substantial costs including legal professional and consulting fees 

 

in addition we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are noncore no longer complement our business are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums from time to time we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets there can be no assurance however that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all

 

if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees as well as other taxes and fees our results could be adversely affected  state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees including taxes and fees on gaming activities from time to time legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase taxes including gaming taxes or fees depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china  the holding company for mgm grand paradise which owns and operates mgm macau and mgm cotai  as a result of the initial public offering of shares of mgm china common stock in 2011 mgm china has stockholders who are not affiliated with us and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers andor directors of mgm china may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of mgm china decisions that could have different implications for us and mgm china including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with mgm china may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018 can be found in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” on february 27 2020 

 

description of our business and key performance indicators

 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities

 

our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions far east baccarat volumes the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and lunar new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results

 

financial impact of covid19

 

the spread of covid19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had and we expect will continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in 2021 in march 2020 all of our domestic properties were temporarily closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of covid19 throughout the second and third quarters of 2020 all of our properties that were temporarily closed reopened to the public but continue to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations  with restrictions varying by jurisdiction and with further temporary reclosures and reopenings occurring for our properties or portions of our properties into the first quarter of 2021  in response to reduced demand we temporarily closed the hotel tower operations at mandalay bay and park mgm midweek and temporarily closed the mirage midweek  which are expected to resume full week operations on march 3 2021  accordingly our properties continued to generate revenues that are significantly lower than historical results in addition  as a result of the continued impact of the covid19 pandemic and the emergence of variant strains our properties may be subject to temporary complete or partial shutdowns in the future at this time we cannot predict whether the jurisdictions in which our properties are located states or the federal government will continue to impose operating restrictions on us or adopt similar or more restrictive measures in the future including stayathome orders or ordering the temporary closures of all or a portion of our properties we have implemented certain measures to mitigate the spread of covid19 including limitations on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and on the number of seats at each table game as well as slot machine spacing temperature checks mask protection limitations on restaurant capacity entertainment events and conventions as well as other measures to enforce social distancing in addition following a temporary closure of our properties in macau on february 5 2020 operations resumed on february 20 2020 subject to certain health safeguards such as limiting the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and the number of seats available at each table game slot machine spacing reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars temperature checks mask protection and the need to present negative covid19 test results and health declarations submitted through the macau health code system which remain in effect effective july 15 2020 all guests entering our casinos were required to provide a negative nucleic acid test result with a valid ‘green’ macau health code although the issuance of tourist visas including the ivs for residents of zhuhai guangdong province and all other provinces in mainland china to travel to macau resumed on august 12 2020 august 26 2020 and september 23 2020 respectively several travel and entry restrictions in macau hong kong and mainland china remain in place including the temporary suspension of ferry services from hong kong to macau the nucleic acid test result certificate and mandatory quarantine requirements 

 

for visitors from hong kong and taiwan  and bans on entry or enhanced quarantine requirements on other visitors into macau  which have significantly impact ed visitation to our macau properties  

 

during 2020 we engaged in aggressive cost reduction efforts to minimize cash outflows while our properties were initially closed and have continued to engage in such efforts as the properties have reopened we still face significant fixed and variable expenses our efforts included 

 











 

on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” was signed into law the cares act provides opportunities for additional liquidity loan guarantees and other government programs to support companies affected by the covid19 pandemic and their employees based on a preliminary analysis of the cares act the benefits we expect to recognize include 

 









 

in addition we have seen and continue to expect to see weakened demand at our properties as a result of continued domestic and international travel restrictions or warnings restrictions on amenity use such as gaming restaurant and pool capacity limitations consumer fears and reduced consumer discretionary spending general economic uncertainty and increased rates of unemployment in light of the foregoing we are unable to determine when our properties will return to prepandemic demand or pricing or if our properties will remain reopened the covid19 pandemic has had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2020 and we expect that it will continue to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2021 and potentially thereafter 

 

the las vegas strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends during the year ended december 31 2020 las vegas visitor volume decreased 55 compared to the prior year period according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority although the las vegas market has had the addition of new sporting events and venues the expansion of convention centers as well as music and entertainment events the covid19 pandemic has drastically impacted visitation 

 

the mgm china segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends during the year ended december 31 2020 macau visitor arrivals decreased 85 compared to the prior year period according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government as a result of the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic

income taxes the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 

 



 

our effective rate for 2020 was unfavorably impacted by losses incurred on our macau operations for which we could not provide tax benefit and increases to valuation allowances for macau deferred tax assets and foreign tax credits partially offset by tax benefit resulting from carrying back net operating losses to tax years with a higher tax rate than is currently in effect our effective tax rate for 2019 was driven primarily by the 27 billion gain recorded on the bellagio transaction income tax expense recorded on this gain results in our effective tax rate approximating our federal and state combined statutory rate and minimizes the impact of other items 

 

cash taxes paid decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the impact of covid19 on business operations in addition 2019 cash taxes paid included federal taxes paid on the liquidation of mgp oh inc a consolidated subsidiary directly owned by mgm growth properties operating partnership lp

 

reportable segment gaap measure 

 

“adjusted property ebitdar” is our reportable segment gaap measure which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments adjusted property ebitdar is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses gain on reit transactions net restructuring costs which represents costs related to severance accelerated stock compensation expense and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the mgm 2020 plan rent expense associated with triplenet

“adjusted ebitdar” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses gain on reit transactions net ceo transition expense october 1 litigation settlement restructuring costs which represents costs related to severance accelerated stock compensation expense and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the mgm 2020 plan rent expense associated with triplenet operating and ground leases income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures and property transactions net 

 

adjusted ebitdar information is a valuation metric should not be used as an operating metric and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts lenders financial institutions and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitdar may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period however as discussed herein adjusted ebitdar should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income because this measure is not presented on a gaap basis and exclude certain expenses including the rent expense associated with our triplenet operating and ground leases and are provided for the limited purposes discussed herein 

 

adjusted ebitdar should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with gaap we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes real estate triplenet lease and ground lease payments and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitdar also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitdar information may calculate adjusted ebitdar in a different manner and such differences may be material

other factors affecting liquidity and anticipated uses of cash

principal debt arrangements 

 

see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements as of december 31 2020 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where the estimates and assumptions involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates 

 

loss reserve for casino accounts receivable 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the united states mgm china performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit refer to note 2 for further discussion of our casino receivables and those due from customers residing in foreign countries 

 

we maintain a loss reserve for casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the loss reserve we regularly evaluate the loss reserve for casino accounts at domestic resorts where marker play is not significant the loss reserve is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account 

 

balances  which is supported by relevant historical analysis and any other known information such as the current economic conditions that could drive losses  at domestic resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s current and expected future financial condition collection history and current and expected future economic conditions  mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer 

 

in addition to enforceability issues the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the loss reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables net of discounts 

 



 

approximately 54 million and 77 million of casino receivables and 18 million and 16 million of the loss reserve for casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable increased in the current year due to an increase in the age of outstanding account balances at our domestic resorts and mgm china primarily due to the covid19 pandemic at december 31 2020 a 100 basispoint change in the loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 3 million

 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

 

property and equipment are stated at cost a significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline 

 

companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses 

 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin during 2019 we recorded a noncash impairment charge relating to the carrying value of circus circus las vegas and adjacent land refer to note 16 for further discussion

 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks for our 2020 annual impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a qualitative “step zero” analysis for certain of our indefinitelived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin we elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the northfield gaming license in 2020 primarily using the discounted cash flow approach for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by 14 as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in an impairment charge 

 

we review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2020 for our 2020 annual impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin for reporting units for which we elected to perform a quantitative analysis the fair value of such reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge

 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of multiples capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

 

see note 2 and note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets

 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

 

see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of otherthantemporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates during 2020 we recorded 64 million in otherthantemporary impairment charges on an equity method investment refer to note 6 for further discussion our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had no material impairments in 2019 or 2018

 

income taxes 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to net operating losses tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences with future tax consequences we reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized accordingly the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on such morelikelythannot realization threshold this assessment considers among other 

 

matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities the duration of statutory carryforward periods and tax planning strategies 

 

we recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our domestic jurisdictions of 27 billion and 25 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of foreign jurisdictions of 156 million and 104 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located

 

furthermore we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk 

 

in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the operating partnership’s credit facility a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions  

as of december 31 2020 variable rate borrowings represented approximately 6 of our total borrowings after giving effect   on the operating partnership’s borrowings for the currently effective interest rate swap agreements on which the operating partnership pays a weighted average of 1821 on a total notional amount of 19 billion additionally the operating partnership has 900 million of notional amount of forward starting swaps that are not currently effective the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above 

 



 

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and mgm cotai while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states china macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the us dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof for us dollar denominated debt incurred by mgm china fluctuations in the exchange rates of the hong kong dollar in relation to the us dollar could have adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations as of december 31 2020 a 1 weakening of the hong kong dollar the functional currency of mgm china to the us dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of 20 million

resort operations 

 

general 

 

most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development acquisitions or investments and repay debt financings

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of empire city casino which operates 20 hours a day every day of the year our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we utilize thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs we lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities

 

as of december 31 2019 we have three reportable segments las vegas strip resorts regional operations and mgm china 

 

 

las vegas strip resorts and regional operations 

las vegas strip resorts las vegas strip resorts consists of the following casino resorts bellagio mgm grand las vegas including the signature mandalay bay including delano and four seasons the mirage luxor new yorknew york including the park excalibur park mgm including nomad las vegas and circus circus las vegas until the sale of such property in december 2019 

regional operations regional operations consists of the following casino resorts mgm grand detroit in detroit michigan beau rivage in biloxi mississippi gold strike tunica in tunica mississippi borgata in atlantic city new jersey mgm national harbor in prince george’s county maryland mgm springfield in springfield massachusetts empire city in yonkers new york upon its acquisition in january 2019 and mgm northfield park in northfield park ohio upon mgm’s acquisition of the operations from mgp in april 2019 

 

over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities

 

our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race and sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere 

 

mgm china

 

we own approximately 56 of mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise sa “mgm grand paradise” the macau company that owns and operates the mgm macau and mgm cotai casino resorts and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at mgm macau and mgm cotai

 

our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and mgm cotai discussed further below mgm china’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau sa which expires in 2022 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations

 

corporate and other 

 

we have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter holdings llc “citycenter” is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee

customers and competition 

 

our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally for further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business see “risk factors — risks related to our business” we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow”

 

our primary methods of successful competition include











 

las vegas strip resorts and regional operations

 

our customers include premium gaming customers leisure and wholesale travel customers business travelers and group customers including conventions trade associations and small meetings we have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and valueoriented tour and travel customers many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during midweek and offpeak periods

 

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the las vegas strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in las vegas also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas

risk factors

tableend

 

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below

 

risks relating to our substantial indebtedness

 

our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments including the fixed component of our rent payments and our debt guarantees could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations  as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 113 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis the operating partnership and mgm china our consolidated subsidiaries had 44 billion and 22 billion respectively of indebtedness outstanding any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs we do not guarantee mgm china’s or the operating partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and to the extent mgm china or the operating partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness our ability to make additional investments into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility 

 

in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us including

 











 

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished moreover our leases with mgp the bellagio breit venture and the mgp breit venture have fixed rental payments with annual escalators and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly development projects including any potential future development of an integrated resort in japan and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

in addition our senior credit facility calculates interest on outstanding balances using the london interbank offered rate “libor” on july 27 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fca announced it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 although our senior credit facility includes libor replacement provisions that contemplate an alternate benchmark rate to be mutually agreed upon by us and the administrative agent if necessary any such changes may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made if libor was available in its current form as a result there can be no assurance that discontinuation of libor will not result in significant increases in benchmark interest rates substantially higher financing costs or a shortage of available debt financing any of which could have an adverse effect on us

 

current and future economic capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures  our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness make our rent payments under our leases and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and other investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates including citycenter and subsidiaries including mgm china and the operating partnership borrow under our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness if regional and national economic conditions deteriorate revenues from our operations could decline as consumer spending levels decrease and we could fail to generate cash sufficient to fund our liquidity needs or satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt and lease instruments we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or continue to receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries nor can we assure you that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us 

 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 202 2  and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements or leases  

 

the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business as well as significantly affect our liquidity and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations  covenants governing our senior credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict among other things our ability to 

 















 

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger crossdefaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness in addition our senior secured credit facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants including a maximum total net leverage ratio a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt

 

in addition each of mgm china and the operating partnership has issued debt securities and is a borrower under credit facilities all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions require them to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries these restrictions include among other things limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets 

 

we are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes  as of december 31 2019 we are required to make annual rent payments of 946 million under the master lease with mgp and annual rent payments of 245 million under the lease with bellagio breit venture and will be required to make annual rent payments of 292 million under the lease with mgp breit venture which leases are also subject to annual escalators as described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the leases also require us to spend a certain amount on capital expenditures at the leased properties as a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditure obligations our ability to fund our operations raise capital make acquisitions make investments service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected for example our obligations under the leases may 

 













 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

the company provides a guarantee of the indebtedness of the bellagio breit venture and mgp breit venture we currently provide a shortfall guarantee of the 301 billion and 30 billion principal amount of indebtedness and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon of the bellagio breit venture and mgp breit venture respectively the terms of each guarantee provide that after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation which amount may be material and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future if we do not have sufficient cash on hand we may need to raise capital including incurring additional indebtedness in order to satisfy our obligation there can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available will be on terms that are satisfactory to us 

 

risks related to our business

 

we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow  the hotel resort entertainment and casino industries are highly competitive we do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area and hotel resort entertainment and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers to the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations competition will increase major competitors including potential new entrants may also expand their hotel room capacity expand their range of amenities improve their level of service or construct new resorts in las vegas macau or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate all of which could attract our customers also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas including california has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas and elsewhere while we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peertopeer inventory sources which allow travelers to book shortterm rentals of homes and apartments from owners we expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution innovations in consumerfacing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business 

 

in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including japan and others such as taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities we would face increased competition 

 

most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions including illinois have legalized video gaming terminals additionally in may 2018 the united states supreme court overturned a federal ban on sports betting that had prohibited singlegame gambling in most states raising the potential for increased competition in sports betting should additional states pass legislation to legalize it the expansion of online gaming sports betting and other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts

 

in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow

 

 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations  our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries states and provinces in which we operate these laws regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally concern the responsibility financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations as such our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or alternatively cease operations in that jurisdiction in addition unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for example in 2018 the us department of justice “doj” reversed its previouslyissued opinion published in 2011 which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the wire act of 1961 “wire act” the doj’s updated opinion concluded instead that the wire act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to nonsportsrelated wagering activity in june 2019 a federal district court in new hampshire ruled that the doj’s new interpretation of the wire act was erroneous and vacated doj’s new opinion doj has appealed the decision of the district court to the us court of appeals for the first circuit an adverse ruling in the court of appeals or other disposition of the case may impact our ability to engage in online internet gaming in the future for a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business see “regulation and licensing” and exhibit 99 1 to this annual report on form 10k  

 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the property state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards certain public and private issuances of securities borrowings under credit agreements guarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities

 

macau laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm china’s interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm china’s activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues

 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos in addition effective january 1 2019 smoking in casinos in macau including mgm macau and mgm cotai will only be permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms rather than outside smoking areas or vip areas the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance

 

we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations for instance we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970 commonly known as the “bank secrecy act” which among other things requires us to report to the internal revenue service “irs” any currency transactions in excess of 10000 that occur within a 24hour gaming day including identification of the individuals involved in the currency transaction we are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know suspect or have reason to suspect transactions among other things involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose in addition under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting recordkeeping and retention our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic examinations by the irs any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws including the bank secrecy act or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 

 

our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside  our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions trade shows and business development economic contraction economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels casino resorts trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer in addition changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel an unstable job market perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other acts of violence consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors including demographic changes which for instance have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for nongaming offerings our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and timely react to these trends and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations in particular aria bellagio and mgm grand las vegas may be affected by economic conditions in the far east and all of our nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the united states and california in particular a recession economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts which would adversely affect our operating results 

 

for example in december 2019 a new strain of coronavirus covid19 was reported in wuhan china in order to mitigate the spread of the virus china has placed certain cities under quarantine and advised its citizens to avoid all nonessential travel and other countries including the us have also restricted inbound travel from china in addition china implemented a temporary suspension of its visa scheme that permits mainland chinese to travel to macau and on february 4 2020 the hong kong sar government temporarily suspended all ferry service from hong kong to macau until further notice the government of macau also asked that all gaming operators in macau suspend casino operations for a 15day period that commenced on february 5 2020 as a result mgm macau and mgm cotai suspended all operations at their properties other than operations that were necessary to provide sufficient nongaming facilities to serve any remaining hotel guests operations at mgm macau and mgm cotai resumed on february 20 2020 however there are currently limits on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and restrictions on the number of seats available at each table and the temporary suspension of the visa scheme and ferry service to macau remains in place the company is currently unable to predict the duration of the business disruption in macau or the impact of the reduced customer traffic at the company’s properties as a result but we expect the impact could have a material effect on mgm china’s results of operations for the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter although the outbreak has been largely concentrated in china to the extent that the virus impacts the willingness or ability of customers to travel to the company’s properties in the united states due to travel restrictions or otherwise the company’s domestic results of operations could also be negatively impacted the extent to which the coronavirus impacts the company’s results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and any additional actions taken to contain it from spreading 

 

in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau and mgm cotai and to a lesser extent our domestic properties from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements including market impacts resulting from china’s recent anticorruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by nonbank lending entities and crossborder currency monitoring including increased restrictions on union pay withdrawals and other atm limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china andor the amounts they are willing to spend at our properties most recently in july 2017 the chinese government along with macau authorities implemented new facial recognition technology on atm machines in macau to strictly enforce the “know you r customer” regulations for mainland chinese bank cardholders and in november 2017 new rules were adopted to control the crossborder transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau

furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of the opening of new developments in macau while we seek employees from outside of macau to adequately staff our resorts certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications for instance the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase finally because additional casino projects have commenced operations and other projects are under construction the existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our developments in macau could be negatively impacted

 

 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our mgm 2020 plan we have undertaken and plan to undertake several initiatives to implement the first phase of our mgm 2020 plan to reduce costs and further position us for growth while we believe these initiatives will exceed 200 million of annual adjusted ebitdar uplift by the end of 2020 compared to 2018 results our efforts may fail to achieve expected results as part of the second phase of our mgm 2020 plan we also expect to invest in our digital transformation to drive customercentric strategy for revenue growth to drive additional ebitdar uplift which efforts may also fail to achieve expected results execution of our mgm 2020 plan is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time and therefore our actual adjusted ebitdar uplift may differ materially from what we anticipate 

 

the anticipated benefits of our asset light strategy including the bellagio saleleaseback transaction and mgp breit venture transaction may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all   our current growth strategy is to pursue and execute on an assetlight business model which involves a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to determine whether those assets can be monetized efficiently to allow unlocked capital to be redeployed towards balance sheet improvements new growth opportunities and to return value to our shareholders our ability to execute on this strategy will depend on our ability to identify accretive transactions that optimize the value of our remaining assets there can be no assurances however that we will be able to monetize our remaining real property assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that any anticipated benefits from any such potential transactions will be realized 

 

our ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements we intend to pay ongoing regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock however our board of directors may in its sole discretion change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely in addition our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in our credit agreement and because we are a holding company with no material direct operations we are dependent on receiving cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock we expect our subsidiaries will continue to generate significant cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock however their ability to generate funds will be subject to their operating results cash requirements and financial condition any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds available to us and compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties in addition each of the companies in our corporate chain must manage its assets liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions future dividend payments may be reduced or eliminated any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

nearly all of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property including risks relating to lease termination lease extensions charges and our relationship with the lessor which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations nearly all of our properties are subject to triplenet leases that in addition to rent require us to pay 1 all facility maintenance 2 all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 3 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on the income of the lessor 4 all capital expenditures and 5 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties we are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities furthermore our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant such as certain events of casualty and condemnation 

 

in addition under the master lease with mgp if some of our facilities should prove to be unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations or if we should otherwise decide to exit a particular property we would remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations even if we decided to cease operations at those locations unless we are able to transfer the rights with respect to a particular property in accordance with the requirements of the mgp master lease furthermore our ability to transfer our obligations under the mgp master lease to a thirdparty with respect to individual properties should we decide to withdraw from a particular location is limited to nonlas vegas properties and no more than two las vegas gaming properties and is subject to identifying a willing thirdparty who meets the requirements for a transferee set forth in the mgp master lease which we may be unable to find in addition we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including sublease termination costs impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

james j murren our chairman daniel j taylor one of our directors and william j hornbuckle and john m mcmanus members of our senior management may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at mgp  james j murren serves as our chairman and as the chairman of mgp in addition daniel j taylor one of our directors is 

 

also a director of mgp and william j hornbuckle and john m mcmanus members of our senior management are also directors of mgp while we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational documents with respect to mgp contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties including fiduciary duties to any mgp shareholder to the fullest extent permitted by law these overlapping positions could nonetheless create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when our or mgps management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities such as potential acquisition targets or face decisions that could have different implications for us and mgp further potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and mgp or its subsidiaries regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship between us and mgp such as under the mgp master lease potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and mgp enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future 

 

despite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of mgp as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding class b share of mgp mgp has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us including transactions involving consideration in excess of 25 million must be approved in accordance with certain specified procedures which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives   we own the single outstanding class b share of mgp the class b share is a noneconomic interest in mgp which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of mgp or upon liquidation or winding up of mgp and which represents a majority of the voting power of mgp’s shares so long as the holder of the class b share and its controlled affiliates’ excluding mgp aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in mgp and the operating partnership does not fall below 30 we therefore have the ability to exercise significant control over mgp’s affairs including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to mgp’s shareholders for approval 

 

mgp’s operating agreement however provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any resolution or course of action by mgp’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to mgp if it is i approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors which mgp refers to as “special approval” such independence determined in accordance with the nyse’s listing standards the standards established by the exchange act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement ii determined by mgp’s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to mgp or iii approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates furthermore mgp’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value individually or in the aggregate over 25 million between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any such transaction other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of mgp’s formation transactions a “threshold transaction” shall be permitted only if i special approval is obtained or ii such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates

 

as a result certain transactions including any threshold transactions that we may want to pursue with mgp and that could have significant benefit to us may require special approval there can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent mgp directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates the failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives

 

we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china  as a result of the extension of the macau gaming subconcession we entered into a first renewed deed of noncompete undertakings with mgm china and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king “ms ho” pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the people’s republic of china macau hong kong and taiwan other than through mgm china while gaming is currently prohibited in china hong kong and taiwan if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of i the date mgm china’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on the stock exchange of hong kong limited or ii the date when our ownership of mgm china shares is less than 20 of the thenissued share capital of mgm china 

 

the macau government can terminate mgm grand paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise  exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession or refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental noncompliance by mgm grand paradise with applicable macau laws or mgm grand paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such noncompliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the macau government upon such termination all of mgm grand paradise’s casino area premises and gamingrelated equipment would be transferred automatically to the macau government without compensation to mgm grand paradise and we would cease to generate 

 

any revenues from these operations we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macau government 

 

furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradise’s compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

in addition the subconcession contract expires on june 26 2022 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradise’s casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues

 

mgm grand paradise is dependent upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in macau  gaming promoters who promote gaming and draw highend customers to casinos are responsible for a significant portion of mgm grand paradise’s gaming revenues in macau with the rise in gaming in macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in macau and in the number of vip rooms operated by licensed gaming promoters the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased while mgm grand paradise is undertaking initiatives to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters in addition continued reductions in and new regulations governing the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure of additional vip rooms in macau including vip rooms at mgm macau and mgm cotai if mgm grand paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters or if gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our highend customers or if as a result of recent market conditions in macau gaming promoters encounter difficulties attracting patrons to come to macau or experience decreased liquidity limiting their ability to grant credit to patrons mgm grand paradise’s ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered furthermore if existing vip rooms at mgm macau and mgm cotai are closed there can be no assurance that mgm grand paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such vip rooms in the future in a timely manner or at all 

 

in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradise’s standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations

 

we also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans

 

the future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce potential taxable foreignsourced income in future periods including the recapture of overall domestic losses to the extent of us taxable income we evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered this evaluation is based on all available evidence including assumptions concerning future us operating profits and foreign source income as a result significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and 

 

changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change 

 

extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business which could harm our business and results of operations  certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes and winter storms in the united states and severe typhoons in macau such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas in addition our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect our business and results of operations although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions furthermore such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified  given that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect our business we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our resorts additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of our customers reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities 

 

we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables  we conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players and highend players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming and variances in winloss results attributable to highend gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter furthermore the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these highend customers could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant in the opinion of management an extension of credit in addition mgm grand paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers uncollectible receivables from highend customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

 

while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations

 

furthermore we expect that mgm china will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm china gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm china may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm china may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm china remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers

 

even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results

 

we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect our future profits  we review our goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance significant negative trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in writedowns and impairment charges in the past and if one or more of such events occurs in the future additional impairment charges or writedowns may be required in future periods if we are required to record additional impairment charges or writedowns this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 

 

 

leisure and business travel  especially travel by air  are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events  such as terrorist attacks other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases  we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air since most of our customers travel by air to our las vegas and macau properties any terrorist act or other acts of violence outbreak of hostilities escalation of war or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the outbreak of infectious diseases such as the recent coronavirus may severely disrupt domestic and international travel for instance the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in several countries including united states issuing travel warnings and suspending flights to and from china in addition on february 4 2020 the hong kong sar government temporarily suspended all ferry service from hong kong to macau until further notice  we are unable to predict the extent to which disruptions to travel as a result of the coronavirus will impact our results of operations but we expect that the current disruption will have an adverse effect on mgm china’s results of operations for the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter furthermore although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable 

 

coinvesting in our properties including our investment in citycenter decreases our ability to manage risk  in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly we have from time to time invested and expect to continue to invest in properties or businesses as a coinvestor coinvestors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business therefore the operation of such properties or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters in addition investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the coinvestor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives consequently actions by a coinvestor might subject the properties or businesses owned by such entities to additional risk further we may be unable to take action without the approval of our coinvestors or our coinvestors could take actions binding on the property without our consent additionally should a coinvestor become bankrupt we could become liable for its share of liabilities 

 

for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our coinvestor are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenter’s indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio as defined in citycenter’s credit facility for each quarter we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test

 

any of our future construction development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables costs and our ability to complete the projects  

 

any of our future construction development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks including

 































 

 

the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake in addition the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines and any such deadlines are not extended we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties including revenue lost while rooms restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service 

 

our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer in addition our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future  although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire natural disasters acts of war or terrorism or other acts of violence each policy has certain exclusions in addition our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events acts of war loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events rolling blackouts or otherwise deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered at all under our policies therefore certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses 

 

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event furthermore the leases we entered into in connection with the mgp breit venture transaction and the bellagio breit venture require us to maintain specified insurance coverage we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits of insurance coverage required by these leases and to the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all then we would need to obtain amendments to the leases or face a default by the applicable tenant under the lease which could have material adverse effect on our business

 

we renew our insurance policies other than our builder’s risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage

 

any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business  the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success while our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks we file applications for and obtain trademarks in the united states and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource we cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the united states and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance competitive advantages or goodwill which could adversely affect our business 

 

 

we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states  our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under nonunited states laws regulations and customs in particular the risks associated with the operation of mgm china or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories include 

 

























 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 

we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease

 

any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or any other similar anticorruption laws could have a negative impact on us  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the united states which exposes us to complex foreign and us regulations inherent in doing crossborder business and in each of the countries in which we transact business we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and other similar anticorruption laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics violations of these laws by us or our noncontrolled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us and the sec and us department of justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the fcpa the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face risks related to pending claims that have been  or future claims that may be  brought against us  claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time we may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition results of operations and reputation please see the further discussion in “legal proceedings” and note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations as of december 31 2019 approximately 38000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements a prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services also wage andor benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations to the extent that our nonunion employees join unions we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems furthermore we may have or acquire in the future multiemployer plans that are classified as “endangered” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status for instance borgata’s most significant plan is the legacy plan of the unite here retirement fund which has been listed in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan which may require additional contributions from employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions andor modifications to retiree benefits in addition while borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time or over a period of time that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of and after withdrawal any such additional costs may be significant 

 

 

our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results  we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and therefore higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations accordingly increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results additionally higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues 

 

the failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data we collect and process information relating to our employees guests and others for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted by the various states the united states and other jurisdictions around the world privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent or conflict between jurisdictions various federal state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy data retention data transfer and data protection for example the european union has adopted a data protection regulation known as the general data protection regulation which became fully enforceable in may 2018 that includes operational and compliance requirements with significant penalties for noncompliance in addition california has enacted a new privacy law known as the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which went into effect on january 1 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the united states 

 

compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us including accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly however they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including but not limited to computer malware viruses hacking and phishing attacks by third parties in addition while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event such coverage may not be sufficient  

 

we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyberattacks or otherwise could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations for instance there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed our information systems and data including those we maintain with our thirdparty service providers may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future in addition our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a thirdparty service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation cause a material disruption to our operations and result in remediation expenses regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers business partners other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas such as diversity and inclusion environmental stewardship supply chain management climate change workplace conduct human rights philanthropy and support for local communities any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets any of which may be unsuccessful  we intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties including mgp acquisitions and investments in businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

 













 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances in addition even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs competitive responses loss or customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention 

 

in addition we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are noncore no longer complement our business are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums from time to time we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets there can be no assurance however that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all

 

if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees as well as other taxes and fees our results could be adversely affected  state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees including taxes and fees on gaming activities from time to time legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase taxes including gaming taxes or fees depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected for instance income generated from gaming operations of mgm grand paradise currently has the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in macau through march 31 2020 which exempts us from paying the 12 complementary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games we have applied for an extension of such exemption to june 26 2022 to run concurrent with its extended subconcession while our competitors have received additional extensions of their complementary tax exemptions through june 26 2022 which runs concurrent with the end of the term of their gaming concessions and we believe mgm grand paradise should also be entitled to such extension in order to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires a requirement under macanese law due to the uncertainty concerning taxation after the subconcession renewal process we cannot assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted beyond march 31 2020 

 

conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china  the holding company for mgm grand paradise which owns and operates mgm macau and mgm cotai  as a result of the initial public offering of shares of mgm china common stock in 2011 mgm china has stockholders who are not affiliated with us and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers andor directors of mgm china may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of mgm china decisions that could have different implications for us and mgm china including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with mgm china may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest

legal proceedings 

tableend

 

october 1 litigation we andor certain of our subsidiaries were named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the october 1 2017 shooting in las vegas the matters involve in large degree the same legal and factual issues each case being filed on behalf of individuals who are seeking damages for emotional distress physical injury medical expenses economic damages andor wrongful death lawsuits were first filed in october 2017 and include actions originally filed in the district court of clark county nevada and in the superior court of los angeles county california in june 2018 we removed to federal court all actions that remained pending in california and nevada state courts we also initiated declaratory relief actions in federal courts in various districts against individuals who had sued or stated an intent to sue  

 

in connection with the mediation of these matters we and law firms representing plaintiffs in the majority of pending matters and purporting to represent substantially all claimants known to us collectively the “claimants” have entered into a settlement agreement the “settlement agreement” whereby subject to the satisfaction of certain monetary and nonmonetary conditions our insurance carriers will deposit funds into a settlement fund covering the plaintiffs and certain other cases that emerged or were filed prior to october 1 2019 pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement we expect that the total amount placed in the fund to be between 735 million and 800 million subject to and depending on obtaining a minimum level of participation with escalators based on greater participation increasing the amount payable up to 800 million in the event of 100 participation by certain categories of claimants as defined in the settlement agreement we have 751 million of insurance coverage available to fund following the mediation a few additional lawsuits were filed against us andor certain of our subsidiaries while it is possible that these lawsuits may be resolved as part of the settlement agreement no assurances can be made that they will be included although we continue to believe we are not legally responsible for the perpetrator’s criminal acts in the interest of avoiding protracted litigation and the related impact on the community we believed it was in the best interests of all parties involved to negotiate and enter into the settlement agreement as a result of the foregoing we believe that it is probable a loss will be incurred and as of december 31 2019 we accrued a liability of 735 million which represents the low end of the range of probable loss in addition we recorded an insurance receivable of 735 million which represents the entire amount of the liability recorded for the settlement of these cases while we intend for substantially all claimants to be covered by the settlement agreement it remains possible that certain claimants may not join the settlement in addition no assurances can be given that the significant conditions to the settlement agreement will be satisfied by the claimants

 

if the conditions in the settlement agreement are not satisfied and the mediation stay is lifted we are currently unable to reliably predict the future developments in outcome of and economic costs and other consequences of any such litigation related to this matter we will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events new information and future circumstances we intend to defend against any such lawsuits and believe we ultimately should prevail but litigation of this type is inherently unpredictable although there are significant procedural factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect our belief as to the possibility of liability we currently believe that it is reasonably possible that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits the foregoing determination was made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as codified in asc 45020 and is not an admission of any liability on our part or any of our affiliates given that these cases would be in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them we do not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability the insurance carriers have not expressed a reservation of rights or coverage defense that affects our evaluation of potential losses in connection with these claims our general liability insurance coverage provides as part of the contractual “duty to defend” payment of legal fees and associated costs incurred to defend covered lawsuits that are filed arising from the october 1 2017 shooting in las vegas payment of such fees and costs is in addition to and not limited by the limits of the insurance policies and does not erode the total liability coverage available

 

other we are a party to various legal proceedings most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

executive overview 

 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities

 

our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives

 

the las vegas strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends during the year ended december 31 2019 las vegas visitor volume increased 1 compared to the prior year period according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority the las vegas market is growing and diversifying with the addition of new sporting events and venues the expansion of convention centers as well as music and entertainment events 

 

the mgm china segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends during the year ended december 31 2019 macau visitor arrivals increased 10 compared to the prior year period according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government in early 2020 the rapid spread of a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus covid19 identified as originating in wuhan hubei province china led to certain cities in china being placed under quarantine and citizens across china were advised to avoid nonessential travel certain countries including the us have restricted inbound travel from mainland china to mitigate the spread of the virus in addition china implemented a temporary suspension of its visa scheme that permits mainland chinese to travel to macau and on february 4 2020 the hong kong sar government temporarily suspended all ferry service from hong kong to macau until further notice the macau government tourism office disclosed total visitation from mainland china to macau decreased 83 and total visitor arrivals decreased 78 during chinese new year as compared to the same period in 2019 on february 4 2020 the government of macau asked that all gaming operators in macau suspend casino operations for a 15day period that commenced on february 5 2020 as a result mgm macau and mgm cotai suspended all operations at their properties other than operations that were necessary to provide sufficient nongaming facilities to serve any remaining hotel guests operations at mgm macau and mgm cotai resumed on february 20 2020 however there are currently limits on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and restrictions on the number of seats available at each table and the temporary suspension of the visa scheme and ferry service to macau remains in place  as a result of these measures we expect material declines in mgm china’s operating results during the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter additionally to the extent that the virus impacts the willingness or ability of customers to travel to our properties in the united states due to travel restrictions or otherwise our domestic results of operations could also be negatively impacted  we are continuing to evaluate the nature and extent of the impacts to our business which could have a material effect on our consolidated operating results for the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter given the uncertain nature of these circumstances the related impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions far east baccarat volumes the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and lunar new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results as evidenced by the recent weakness in far east baccarat which we expect to continue in 2020 in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results

nongaap measures 

 

“adjusted ebitdar” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses gain on bellagio transaction restructuring costs which represents costs related to severance accelerated stock compensation expense and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the mgm 2020 plan nv energy exit expense rent expense associated with triple net operating and ground leases income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in reits and property transactions net we utilize “adjusted property ebitdar” as the primary profit measures for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments adjusted property ebitdar is a measure defined as adjusted ebitdar before corporate expense and stock compensation expense which are not allocated to each operating segment and before rent expense related to the master lease with mgp that eliminates in consolidation we manage capital allocation tax planning stock compensation and financing decisions at the corporate level “adjusted property ebitdar margin” is adjusted property ebitdar divided by related segment net revenues 

 

adjusted ebitdar information is a valuation metric should not be used as an operating metric and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because we believe these measures are widely used by analysts lenders financial institutions and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitdar adjusted property ebitdar and adjusted property ebitdar margin may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition we changed our nongaap measures in the fourth quarter of 2019 including recasting prior periods as a result of the bellagio real estate transaction to exclude rent expense associated with triple net operating leases and ground leases we believe excluding rent expense associated with triple net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts lenders financial institutions and investors when valuing us as well as comparing our results to other gaming companies without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple net operating leases or ground leases however as discussed herein adjusted ebitdar and adjusted property ebitdar should not be viewed as measures of overall operating performance considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income because these measures are not presented on a gaap basis and exclude certain expenses including the rent expense associated with our triple net operating and ground leases and are provided for the limited purposes discussed herein 

 

adjusted ebitdar adjusted property ebitdar or adjusted property ebitdar margin should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or net income as indicators of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes real estate triple net lease and ground lease payments and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitdar adjusted property ebitdar or adjusted property ebitdar margin also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitdar adjusted property ebitdar or adjusted property ebitdar margin information may calculate adjusted ebitdar adjusted property ebitdar or adjusted property ebitdar margin in a different manner and such differences may be material

our cash flows consisted of the following 

 



 

cash flows 

 

operating activities trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income excluding noncash charges but can be affected by changes in working capital the timing of significant interest payments tax payments or refunds and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates  cash provided by operating activities increased to 18 billion in 2019 from 17 billion in 2018 operating cash flows increased in the current year period compared to the prior year period due to increases in our operating income primarily from our regional operations and mgm china as discussed above partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest as discussed in “nonoperating results” and an increase in cash paid for taxes in addition operating cash flows in the current year period were negatively affected by a decrease in working capital primarily related to a decrease in gaming deposits operating cash flows in the prior year period were negatively affected by a decrease in working capital primarily related to the timing of significant chip purchases by gaming promoters at mgm china 

 

 

investing activities our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts business acquisitions or dispositions and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms 

 

cash provided by investing activities was 35 billion in 2019 compared to cash used in investing activities of 21 billion in 2018 the change was due primarily to 42 billion of proceeds received related to the sale of bellagio 652 million of proceeds received related to the sale of circus circus las vegas and adjacent land the inclusion of the 10 billion outflow for mgp’s acquisition of northfield park in 2018 and a decrease of 748 million in capital expenditures partially offset by a 536 million outflow for the acquisition of empire city and a 222 million decrease in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2019 included our 90 million share of a 180 million dividend paid by citycenter in 2019 distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2018 included our 313 million share of a 625 million dividend paid by citycenter the decrease in capital expenditures primarily reflects substantial completion of our development projects at mgm cotai mgm springfield and the rebranding at park mgm as discussed in further detail below

financing activities cash used in financing activities was 45 billion in 2019 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 389 million in 2018 the change was due primarily to net debt repayments of 41 billion in 2019 compared to net debt borrowings of 22 billion in 2018 partially offset by proceeds from mgp’s issuances of class a shares in 2019 of 13 billion and a decrease of 252 million in share repurchases

other factors affecting liquidity 

 

anticipated sources and uses of cash we require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts in addition to required cash on hand for operations we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our credit facility we have significant outstanding debt rent payments interest payments and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and required capital expenditures pursuant to the terms of our longterm leases in addition we plan to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our credit facility and delaware law as applicable

as discussed in executive overview due to of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus covid19 primarily concentrated in china and the resulting impacts on visitation to macau we expect material declines in mgm china’s operating results during the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter additionally to the extent that the virus impacts the willingness or ability of customers to travel to our properties in the united states due to travel restrictions or otherwise our domestic results of operations could also be negatively impacted  we are continuing to evaluate the nature and extent of the impacts to our business which could have a material effect on our consolidated operating results for the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter given the uncertain nature of these circumstances the related impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates 

 

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the united states mgm china performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit refer to note 2 for further discussion of the company’s casino receivables and those due from customers residing in foreign countries 

 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at domestic resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at domestic resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer 

 

 

in addition to enforceability issues the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables net of discounts 

 



 

approximately 77 million and 48 million of casino receivables and 16 million and 12 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable increased in the current year due to an increase in the age of outstanding account balances at our domestic resorts at december 31 2019 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 4 million

property and equipment are stated at cost a significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses

 

 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin during 2019 we recorded a noncash impairment charge relating to the carrying value of circus circus las vegas and adjacent land refer to note 16 for further discussion

 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks for our 2019 annual impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a qualitative “step zero” analysis for certain of our indefinitelived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin we elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the borgata trade name using the relieffromroyalty method for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 11 in 2019 we also elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the northfield gaming license in 2019 primarily using the discounted cash flow approach for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in an impairment charge 

 

we review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2019 for our 2019 annual impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin for reporting units for which we elected to perform a quantitative analysis the fair value of such reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge

 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of multiples capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

 

see note 2 and note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets

 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

 

see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of otherthantemporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had no material impairments in 2019 2018 or 2017

 

income taxes 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied

 

 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities  

 

we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in “other accrued liabilities” or longterm in “other longterm liabilities” based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk 

 

in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the operating partnership’s credit facility a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions  

as of december 31 2019 variable rate borrowings represented approximately 10 of our total borrowings after giving effect to the currently effective interest rate swap agreements on which the operating partnership pays a weighted average of 1821 on a total notional amount of 19 billion additionally the operating partnership has 900 million of notional amount of forward starting swaps that are not currently effective the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above  

 



 

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and mgm cotai while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states china macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the us dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof for us dollar denominated debt incurred by mgm china fluctuations in the exchange rates of the hong kong dollar in relation to the us dollar could have adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations as of december 31 2019 a 1 weakening of the hong kong dollar the functional currency of mgm china to the us dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of 15 million

resort operations 

 

general 

 

most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development acquisitions or investments and repay debt financings

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and lunar new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results 

 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of our newly acquired empire city casino which operates 20 hours a day every day of the year at our domestic resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we utilize thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs we lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities

customers and competition 

 

our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally for further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business see “risk factors — risks related to our business” we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow”

 

our primary methods of successful competition include











 

las vegas strip resorts and regional operations

outside nevada our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region 

 

mgm china

 

the three primary customer bases in the macau gaming market are vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements and rolling chip turnoverbased commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this customer base represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future to target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which include both table games and slots to the main floor gaming area the amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players

risk factors 

tableend

 

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below

 

risks relating to our substantial indebtedness

 



 

in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us including

 











 

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished and under the master lease we are required to spend an aggregate amount of at least 1 of actual adjusted net revenues from the properties subject to the master lease on capital expenditures at those properties such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly development projects including any potential future development of an integrated resort in japan and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 



 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2020 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements 

 

 



 















 

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger crossdefaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness in addition our senior secured credit facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants including a maximum total net leverage ratio a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt

 

in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and the operating partnership is a borrower under its senior secured credit facility all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions in particular these credit agreements require mgm china and the operating partnership to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries including with respect to mgm china mgm grand paradise these restrictions include among other things limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets 

 



 













 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

risks related to our business 

 



 

in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including japan and others such as taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future including for example a recent proposal by china to allow gambling on hainan island furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities we would face increased competition 

 

most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions including illinois have legalized video gaming terminals additionally in may 2018 the united states supreme court overturned a federal ban on sports betting that had prohibited singlegame gambling in most states raising the potential for increased competition in sports betting should additional states pass legislation to legalize it the expansion of online gaming sports betting and other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts

 

in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow

 



 

 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the property state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities

 

in macau current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm china’s interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm china’s activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues

 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos in addition effective january 1 2019 smoking in casinos in macau including mgm macau and mgm cotai will only be permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms rather than outside smoking areas or vip areas the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance

 

we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations for instance we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970 commonly known as the “bank secrecy act” which among other things requires us to report to the internal revenue service “irs” any currency transactions in excess of 10000 that occur within a 24hour gaming day including identification of the individuals involved in the currency transaction we are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know suspect or have reason to suspect transactions among other things involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose in addition under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting recordkeeping and retention our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic examinations by the irs any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws including the bank secrecy act or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 



 



 

in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau and mgm cotai from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements including market impacts resulting from china’s recent anticorruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by nonbank lending entities and crossborder currency monitoring including increased restrictions on union pay withdrawals and other atm limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china andor the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino most recently in july 2017 the chinese government along with macau authorities implemented new facial recognition technology on atm machines in macau to strictly enforce the “know you r customer” regulations for mainland chinese bank cardholders and in november 2017 new rules were adopted to control the crossborder transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau

furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resorts certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications for instance the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase finally because additional casino projects have commenced operations and other projects are under construction existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai macau could be negatively impacted

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

mgp’s operating agreement however provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any resolution or course of action by mgp’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to mgp if it is i approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors which mgp refers to as “special approval” such independence determined in accordance with the nyse’s listing standards the standards established by the exchange act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement ii determined by mgp’s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to mgp or iii approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates furthermore mgp’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value individually or in 

 

the aggregate over 25 million between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any such tra nsaction other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of mgp’s formation transactions a “threshold transaction” shall be per mitted only if i special approval is obtained or ii such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliate s 

 

as a result certain transactions including any threshold transactions that we may want to pursue with mgp and that could have significant benefit to us may require special approval there can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent mgp directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates the failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives

 



 



 

furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradise’s compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradise’s casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues

 

 



 

in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradise’s standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations

 

we also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations

 

furthermore we expect that mgm china will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm china gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm china may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm china may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm china remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers

 

even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results

 



 



 



 



 

for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our coinvestor are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenter’s indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio as defined in citycenter’s credit facility for each quarter we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test

 



 

any of our future construction development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks including

 































 

the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake in addition the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines and any such deadlines are not extended we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties including revenue lost while rooms restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service 

 



 



 

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 

 

we renew our insurance policies other than our builder’s risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage

 



 



 

























 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 

we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us including accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly however they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including but not limited to computer malware viruses hacking and phishing attacks by third parties in addition while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event such coverage may not be sufficient  

 

 

we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintai n information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyberattacks or otherwise could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations for instan ce there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed our information systems and data including those we maintain with our thir dparty service providers may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future in addition our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a thirdparty service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation cause a material disruption to our operations a nd result in remediation expenses regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

 



 



 













 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances in addition even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs competitive responses loss or customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention 

 

in addition we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are noncore no longer complement our business are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums from time to time we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets there can be no assurance however that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all

october 1 litigation we andor certain of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the october 1 2017 shooting in las vegas the matters involve in large degree the same legal and factual issues each case being filed on behalf of individuals who are seeking damages for emotional distress physical injury medical expenses economic damages andor wrongful death based on assertions that we andor certain of our subsidiaries were negligent we also received letters from attorneys purporting to represent other persons with claims related to the october 1 2017 shooting lawsuits were first filed in october 2017 and include actions filed by multiple individuals in the district court of clark county nevada and in the superior court of los angeles county california some of the original actions have been voluntarily dismissed and plaintiffs’ counsel indicate they anticipate refiling the lawsuits in similar form in june 2018 we removed to federal court all actions that remained pending in california and nevada state courts following the voluntary dismissals motions to remand have been filed in several cases and we anticipate that there may be additional motions to remand filed in the future we also initiated declaratory relief actions in federal courts in various districts against individuals who had sued or stated an intent to sue additional lawsuits related to this incident may be filed in the future in february of 2019 we and plaintiffs’ counsel commenced mediation of these matters the abovedescribed litigation currently is stayed pending mediation  

 

we are currently unable to reliably predict the future developments in outcome of and economic costs and other consequences of pending or future litigation related to this matter we will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events new information and future circumstances we intend to defend against these lawsuits and ultimately believe we should prevail but litigation of this type is inherently unpredictable although there are significant procedural factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect our belief as to the possibility of liability we currently believe that it is reasonably possible that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits the foregoing determination was made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as codified in asc 45020 and is not an admission of any liability on the part of us or any of our affiliates given that these cases are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them we do not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability in the event we incur any liability we believe it is unlikely we would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of our insurance coverage the insurance carriers have not expressed a reservation of rights or coverage defense that affects our evaluation of potential losses in connection with these claims in addition our general liability insurance coverage provides as part of the contractual “duty to defend” payment of legal fees and associated costs incurred to defend covered lawsuits that are filed arising from the october 1 2017 shooting in las vegas payment of such fees and costs is in addition to and not limited by the limits of the insurance policies and does not erode the total liability coverage available  

 

other we are a party to various legal proceedings most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

 

executive overview 

 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities

 

our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives

 

during the year ended december 31 2018 las vegas visitor volume decreased 02 las vegas strip revpar increased 1 and las vegas strip gaming revenue increased by 2 compared to the prior year period according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority results of operations for our las vegas strip resorts during 2018 were negatively impacted by disruption related to the repositioning and rebranding of park mgm discussed below 

 

our regional operations results are driven and affected by the increasingly competitive jurisdictions that they operate in including the expansion of other jurisdictions that permit gaming results of operations at our regional operations were negatively affected by the opening of two casino resorts in atlantic city new jersey in june 2018 which impacted borgata’s operating results and benefitted from the opening of mgm springfield in august 2018 discussed below

 

gross gaming revenue in the macau market increased 14 in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily as a result of growth on the cotai strip additionally according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government visitor arrivals increased 10 and overnight visitors increased 7 in 2018 compared to 2017 as a significant number of mgm macau’s customers are from mainland china we believe operating results at mgm macau are affected by economic conditions in mainland china as well as certain policy initiatives enacted in mainland china and macau despite concerns over the sustainability of economic growth in china we expect the macau market to grow on a longterm basis due to further development and penetration of the mainland china market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau we believe recent trends reflect stabilization and growth within the macau market as gross gaming revenue has increased consistently over the last several years additionally we have seen growth due to the opening of mgm cotai in february 2018 

 

pursuant to a master lease agreement between the tenant and the landlord the tenant leases the real estate assets of the mirage mandalay bay luxor new yorknew york park mgm excalibur the park gold strike tunica mgm grand detroit beau rivage borgata and mgm national harbor from the landlord see note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding mgp and the operating partnership which we consolidate in our financial statements and note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the master lease with mgp all intercompany transactions including transactions under the master lease have been eliminated in consolidation

nonoperating results 

 

interest expense the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt 

 



 

 

gross interest expense in 2018 increased 41 million compared to 2017 due to an increase in the average debt outstanding relating to our senior notes and our credit facilities and an increase in the weighted aver age interest rate of our credit facilities partially offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs gross interest expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average debt outstanding related to our senior notes and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of our senior notes this was partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding under our credit facilities and an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs see note 9 t o the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on longterm debt and see “liquidity and capital resources” for additional discussion on issuances and repayments of longterm debt and other sources and uses of cash 

 

capitalized interest in 2018 decreased from 2017 due primarily to the substantial completion of mgm cotai in february 2018 partially offset by an increase related to the mgm springfield project which was substantially completed in august 2018 capitalized interest in 2017 decreased from 2016 due primarily to the opening of mgm national harbor in december 2016 partially offset by the mgm cotai and mgm springfield projects

 

nonoperating items from unconsolidated affiliates nonoperating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased 18 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to the acquisition of borgata on august 1 2016 at which time we began to consolidate borgata prior thereto our 50 ownership interest in borgata was accounted for under the equity method 

 

other net other expense in 2018 decreased 30 million compared to 2017 due primarily to the loss incurred on early retirement of debt in 2017 of 44 million related to our early retirement of the 11375 senior notes due 2018 and the mgm national harbor credit facility other expense in 2017 decreased 24 million compared to 2016 primarily due to the loss on the early retirement of debt in 2016 of 65 million related to our 7625 senior notes due 2017 our 75 senior notes due 2016 our 10 senior notes due 2016 and our prior senior credit facility offset by the loss on early retirement of debt incurred in 2017 as described above 

 

income taxes the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 

 



 

our effective tax rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the us federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 the reversal of macau shareholder dividend tax that was accrued in 2017 upon receipt of the extension of the annual fee arrangement partially offset by sab 118 measurement period tax expense related to the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” our effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by a nonrecurring noncash income tax benefit of 14 billion resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities required due to the enactment of the tax act partially offset by the accrual of the macau shareholder dividend tax our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit “ftc” carryovers and permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on the borgata transaction partially offset by income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the macau complementary tax on gaming profits

 

cash taxes paid decreased in 2018 primarily due to the impact of the tax act changes most notably the increase in the recapture of overall domestic losses from 50 percent of us taxable income to 100 percent of us taxable income resulting in increased ftc carryover usage cash taxes paid increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in federal income taxes paid resulting from increased us taxable income and state income taxes attributable to borgata which has been consolidated since the august 2016 acquisition of boyd gaming’s interest in the company

 

nongaap measures 

 

“adjusted ebitda” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses nv energy exit expense gain on borgata transaction and property transactions net “adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense which are not allocated to each property “adjusted property ebitda margin” is adjusted property ebitda divided by net revenues adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies 

 

 

we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda and adjusted property ebitda margin may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of domestic resorts operating performance 

 

adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda or adjusted property ebitda margin should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or net income as indicators of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda or adjusted property ebitda margin also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda or adjusted property ebitda margin information may calculate adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda or adjusted property ebitda margin in a different manner

operating activities trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income excluding noncash charges but can be affected by changes in working capital the timing of significant interest payments tax payments or refunds and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion in 2018 compared to 22 billion in 2017 operating cash flows decreased in the current period primarily due to the change in working capital related to timing of significant purchases of chips by gaming promoters at mgm china as well as a decrease in consolidated operating income and an increase in cash paid for interest in 2018 we received net cash tax refunds of 10 million compared to cash paid for taxes of 182 million in 2017 primarily as a result of the tax act 

 

cash provided by operating activities in 2017 in comparison to 2016 was positively affected by increase in operating income at our las vegas strip resorts and regional operations and changes in working capital primarily related to the timing of significant purchases of chips by gaming promoters at mgm china partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes to 182 million in 2017 compared to 68 million in 2016 

 

 

investing activities our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts business acquisitions or dispositions and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms 

 

cash used in investing activities in 2018 increased in comparison to 2017 as a result of the 10 billion outflow by the operating partnership for the northfield acquisition partially offset by a decrease of 377 million in capital expenditures as well as an inflow of 164 million for proceeds received related to the sale of our investment in grand victoria the decrease in capital expenditures from 2018 to 2017 of 377 million primarily reflects less expenditures for the developments of mgm cotai and mgm national harbor partially offset by increased expenditures for mgm springfield and the rebranding at park mgm as discussed in further detail below 

cash used in investing activities in 2017 decreased in comparison to 2016 as a result of the 559 million outflow for the borgata acquisition in 2016 as well as a 398 million decrease in capital expenditures partially offset by a decrease of 240 million in the distributions received from citycenter the decrease in capital expenditures from 2016 to 2017 of 398 million primarily reflects less expenditures for the developments of mgm cotai and mgm national harbor partially offset by increased expenditures for mgm springfield and the rebranding of park mgm as discussed in further detail below

other factors affecting liquidity 

 

anticipated uses of cash we require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts in addition to required cash on hand for operations we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our senior secured credit facility in addition from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our senior secured credit facility and delaware law as applicable we have significant outstanding debt interest payments and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and acquisitions

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates 

 

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the united states mgm china performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit refer to note 2 for further discussion of the company’s casino receivables and those due from customers residing in foreign countries 

 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at domestic resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at domestic resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer 

 

 

in addition to enforceability issues the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables net of discounts 

 



 

approximately 48 million and 31 million of casino receivables and 12 million and 7 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased in the current year due to a decrease in specific reserve at our las vegas strip resorts as a result of favorable collections at december 31 2018 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 4 million

 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

 

property and equipment are stated at cost a significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses

 

 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the g rouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin 

 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks for our 2018 and 2017 annual impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a qualitative “step zero” analysis for certain of our indefinitelived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin we elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the borgata trade name using the relieffrom royalty method for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14 in 2018 and 4 in 2017 for our 2016 annual impairment tests we utilized a quantitative analysis for all of our intangible assets using a discounted cash flow approach for license rights and using the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks the estimated fair values of the intangibles were substantially in excess of their carrying values with the fair value of the borgata trade name exceeding its carrying value by approximately 2 reflecting the recentness of the borgata acquisition which occurred in august 2016 as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in an impairment charge 

 

we review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2018 2017 or 2016 for our 2018 2017 and 2016 annual impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin for reporting units for which we elected to perform a quantitative analysis the fair value of such reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge

 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of multiples capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

 

see note 2 and note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets

 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

 

see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of otherthantemporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates none of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had otherthantemporary impairment in 2018 2017 or 2016

 

income taxes 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied

 

 

we file income tax returns in the us feder al jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities 

 

we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in “other accrued liabilities” or longterm in “other longterm liabilities” based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

 

refer to note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk 

 

in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the operating partnership’s term loan b facility a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions

as of december 31 2018 variable rate borrowings represented approximately 31 of our total borrowings after giving effect to the 500 million and 700 million notional amount operating partnership interest rate swaps with weighted average fixed rates that we pay 1764 and 1901 respectively in december 2018 the operating partnership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements for which the operating partnership will pay a weighted average 2735 on a total notional amount of 400 million these swaps will be effective december 31 2019 at which point the operating partnership will be paying a combined weighted average 2066 the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above 

 



 

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and mgm cotai while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states china macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the us dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof as of december 31 2018 a 1 increase in the hong kong dollar the functional currency of mgm china to the us dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by 5 million and a 1 decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by 25 million

resort operations 

 

general 

 

most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development acquisitions or investments and repay debt financings

 

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and lunar new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the finan cial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results 

 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our domestic resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we utilize thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs we lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities

 

our operating resorts 

 

we have provided certain information below about our resorts as of december 31 2017 except as otherwise indicated we own and operate the resorts shown below 

 



 



 



















 

 

more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 

 

reportable segments

 

we have two reportable segments based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments domestic resorts and mgm china we currently own and operate 14 resorts in the united states mgm china’s operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino “mgm macau” and mgm cotai an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort on the cotai strip in macau that opened on february 13 2018 we have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter holdings llc “citycenter” is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee see “executive overview” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 17 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our segments

 

  domestic resorts

 

over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities

 

our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race and sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere 

 

mgm china

 

we own approximately 56 of mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise sa “mgm grand paradise” the macau company that owns and operates the mgm macau and mgm cotai casino resorts and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at mgm macau and mgm cotai

 

our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and mgm cotai discussed further below mgm china’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau sa and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations

 

in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop mgm cotai on an approximately 18 acre site on the cotai strip the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years mgm cotai is an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort that opened on february 13 2018 the gaming inspection and coordination bureau of macau “dicj” approved 100 gaming tables for the opening of mgm cotai and 25 additional gaming tables effective for operation on january 1 2019 for a total of 125 gaming tables in aggregate in addition the dicj approved the initial transfer of 77 gaming tables from mgm macau to mgm cotai we expect total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately 34 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and landrelated costs

 

customers and competition 

 

our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally 

 

 

our primary methods of successful competition include 











 

  domestic resorts

 

our customers include premium gaming customers leisure and wholesale travel customers business travelers and group customers including conventions trade associations and small meetings we have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and valueoriented tour and travel customers many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during midweek and offpeak periods

 

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the las vegas strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in las vegas also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas

 

outside nevada our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region 

 

  mgm china

 

the three primary customer bases in the macau gaming market are vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this customer base represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future to target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which include both table games and slots to the main floor gaming area the amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players 

 

our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally we face competition at our macau and cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations primarily on the cotai strip with several openings having occurred during 2016 and another casino resort expected to open in 2019

 

we encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of asia and around the world including singapore korea australia new zealand malaysia vietnam cambodia the philippines russia cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region 

 

  corporate and other

 

much like our domestic resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts we manage and own 50 of citycenter which includes aria casino resort aria appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our domestic casino resorts and other resorts on the las vegas strip grand victoria our other unconsolidated affiliate mainly competes for customers against casino resorts in the chicago metropolitan market 

 

 

marketing

 

our marketing efforts are conducted through various means including our loyalty programs we advertise on radio television internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as by direct mail email and through the use of social media we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major us and foreign cities our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers influence incremental visits and help build lasting customer relationships

corporate social responsibility 

 

we seek to conduct our business in an ethical and socially responsible way through sustainable business practices which we regard as essential to maximizing shareholder value while enhancing community quality and environmental stewardship our corporate social responsibility efforts are overseen by the corporate social responsibility committee of our board of directors 

 

diversity and inclusion diversity and inclusion are fundamental to our company’s value system our people philosophy our cultural life and therefore our competitive advantage as an employer and destination of choice for our global customer base our inclusion initiative at our resorts fosters employee engagement individual responsibility team collaboration leadership competency high performance and innovation our diversity and inclusion initiative has been widely recognized for many years through numerous awards and accolades

the construction of mgm springfield will further position mgm resorts as a leader in sustainable resort operations and by adopting innovative technologies in the design and operating practices of this resort we are advancing our commitment to protecting our planet in new regions 

 

development and leveraging our brand and management assets 

 

in allocating resources our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts spending on new resorts and other developments or initiatives and repaying longterm debt or returning capital to shareholders we believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns 

 

we regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in nevada or in states other than nevada or outside of the united states we leverage our management expertise and wellrecognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities we feel that several of our brands are wellsuited to new projects in both gaming and nongaming developments we may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

 

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below

 

risks relating to our substantial indebtedness

 



 

in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us including

 











 

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished and under the master lease we are required to spend an aggregate amount of at least 1 of actual adjusted net revenues from the properties subject to the master lease on capital expenditures at those properties such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly development projects including our development project in massachusetts and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 



 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2019 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements 

 

 



 















 

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger crossdefaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness in addition our senior secured credit facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants including a maximum total net leverage ratio a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt

 

in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and the operating partnership is a borrower under its senior secured credit facility all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions in particular these credit agreements require mgm china and the operating partnership to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries including with respect to mgm china mgm grand paradise these restrictions include among other things limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets 

 



 













 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

risks related to our business 

 



 

in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including japan and others such as taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future including for example a recent proposal by china to allow gambling on hainan island furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities we would face increased competition 

 

most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions including illinois have legalized video gaming terminals the expansion of online gaming and other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts

 

in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow

 



 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the property state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities

 

 

in macau current laws and regulations co ncerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm china’s interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm china’s activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues 

 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos similarly in october 2014 casinos in macau including mgm china implemented a smoking ban which prohibits smoking on all mass market gaming floors and in 2015 the macau health bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposing a full smoking ban in casinos including in vip rooms the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance

 

we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations for instance we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970 commonly known as the “bank secrecy act” which among other things requires us to report to the internal revenue service “irs” any currency transactions in excess of 10000 that occur within a 24hour gaming day including identification of the individuals involved in the currency transaction we are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know suspect or have reason to suspect transactions among other things involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose in addition under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting recordkeeping and retention our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic examinations by the irs any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws including the bank secrecy act or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 



 

 

in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china general economic and market condit ions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements including market impacts resulting from china’s recent anticorruption campaign a nd related tightening of liquidity provided by nonbank lending entities and crossborder currency monitoring including increased restrictions on union pay withdrawals and other atm limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government could dis rupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau andor the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino for example from 2008 through 2010 china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period in addition effective october 2013 china banned “zero ‑fare” tour groups involving no or low upfront payments and compulsory shopping which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland chi na and in december 2014 the chinese government tightened the enforcement of visa transit rules for those seeking to enter macau at the gongbei border including requirements to present an airplane ticket to a destination country a visa issued by such des tination country and a valid chinese passport most recently in july 2017 the chinese government along with macau authorities implemented new facial recognition technology on atm machines in macau to strictly enforce the “know you r customer” regulatio ns for mainland chinese bank cardholders it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be impl emented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau 

furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resorts certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications for instance the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase finally because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai macau could be negatively impacted

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

mgp’s operating agreement however provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any resolution or course of action by mgp’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to mgp if it is i approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which 

 

consists solely of “independent” directors which mgp refers to as “special approval” such independence determined in accordance with the nyse’s listing standards the standards established by the exchange act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement ii determined by mgp’s boa rd of directors to be fair and reasonable to mgp or iii approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates furthermore m gp’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value individually or in the aggregate over 25 million between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the o ther hand any such transaction other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of mgp’s formation transactions a “threshold tran saction” shall be permitted only if i special approval is obtained or ii such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates 

 

as a result certain transactions including any threshold transactions that we may want to pursue with mgp and that could have significant benefit to us may require special approval there can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent mgp directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates the failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives

 



 



 

furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradise’s compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradise’s casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice in the event the macau government 

 

exercises t his redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the conv ention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm g rand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to co mpensate for the loss of future revenues 

 



 

in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradise’s standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations

 

we also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations

 

furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers

 

even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results

 





 

 



 

for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our coinvestor are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenter’s indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio as defined in citycenter’s credit facility for each quarter we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test

 



 

any of our future construction development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks including

 































 

the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake for instance we currently expect the total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately 34 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and landrelated costs and we currently expect total development costs of our massachusetts project to be approximately 960 million excluding capitalized interest and landrelated costs while we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects including our development in massachusetts will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted or that the expected design and features of current or future projects will not 

 

change in additio n the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines and any such deadlines are not extended we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties including revenue lost while rooms restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service 

 



 



 

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 

 

we renew our insurance policies other than our builder’s risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage

 



 

 



 

























 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 

we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us including accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of customer and employee information such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly however they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including but not limited to computer malware viruses and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties in addition while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event such coverage may not be sufficient  

 

we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyberattacks or otherwise could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations for instance there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed our information systems and records including those we maintain with our thirdparty service providers may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future in addition our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a thirdparty service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation cause a material disruption to our operations and management team and result in remediation expenses regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

 



 

 



 













 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances in addition even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs competitive responses loss or customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention 

 

in addition we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are noncore no longer complement our business are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums from time to time we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets there can be no assurance however that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all

october 1 litigation the company andor certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the october 1 2017 shooting in las vegas the matters involve in large degree the same legal and factual issues in each case being filed on behalf of individuals who are seeking damages for emotional distress physical injury medical expenses economic damages andor wrongful death based on assertions that the company andor certain of its subsidiaries were negligent lawsuits were first filed in october 2017 and include actions filed by multiple individuals in the district court of clark county nevada and in the superior court of los angeles county california some of the original actions have been voluntarily dismissed and plaintiffs’ counsel indicate they anticipate refiling the lawsuits in similar form additional lawsuits related to this incident may be filed in the future 

 

we are currently unable to reliably predict the developments in outcome of and economic costs and other consequences of pending or future litigation related to this matter we will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events new information and future circumstances we intend to defend against these lawsuits and ultimately believe we should prevail but litigation of this type is inherently unpredictable although there are significant procedural factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect our belief as to the possibility of liability we currently believe that it is reasonably possible that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits the foregoing determination was made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as codified in accounting standards codification “asc” 45020 and is not an admission of any liability on the part of us or any of our affiliates given that these cases are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them we do not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability in the event we incur any liability we believe it is unlikely we would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of our insurance coverage in addition our general liability insurance coverage provides as part of the contractual “duty to defend” payment of legal fees and associated costs incurred to defend covered lawsuits that are filed arising from the october 1 2017 shooting in las vegas payment of such fees and costs is in addition to and not limited by the limits of the insurance policies and does not erode the total liability coverage available the insurance carriers have not expressed any reservation of rights or coverage defenses that indicate they dispute coverage under the applicable policies

 

 

other we and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other lawsuits most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business we do not believe that the outcome of such pending litigation considered in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and res ults of operations 

tableend

executive overview 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities

during the year ended december 31 2017 las vegas visitor volume decreased 2 las vegas strip revpar increased 2 and las vegas strip gaming revenue increased by 1 compared to the prior year period according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority results of operations for our domestic resorts during 2017 benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and revpar discussed below our rooms revenue benefited from robust convention business at our las vegas strip resorts which allowed us to yield higher room rates across our portfolio of resorts

gross gaming revenue in the macau market increased 19 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of growth on the cotai strip additionally according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government visitor arrivals increased 5 and overnight visitors increased 10 in 2017 compared to 2016 as a significant number of mgm macau’s customers are from mainland china we believe operating results at mgm macau are affected by economic conditions in mainland china as well as certain policy initiatives enacted in mainland china and macau we believe a slowdown in china’s economic growth rate as well as the implementation of policies related to gaming promoters the chinese government’s restrictions on travel to macau and crossborder currency transactions led to a multiyear decrease in gross gaming revenues for the macau market which lasted through the first half of 2016 and primarily impacted vip casino gaming operations and to a lesser extent main floor operations throughout the macau market despite the impact of these events and concerns over the sustainability of economic growth in china we expect the macau market to grow on a longterm basis due to further development and penetration of the mainland china market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau we believe recent trends reflect stabilization and growth within the macau market as gross gaming revenue has increased year over year in each month beginning in august 2016 and continuing through december 2017 

our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities for instance we opened mgm cotai on february 13 2018 mgm cotai is an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort located on an 18 acre site on the cotai strip in macau the gaming inspection and coordination bureau of macau “dicj” approved 100 gaming tables for the opening of mgm cotai and 25 additional gaming tables effective for operation on january 1 2019 for a total of 125 gaming tables in aggregate in addition the dicj approved the initial transfer of 77 gaming tables from mgm macau to mgm cotai 

additionally we were awarded a casino license to build and operate mgm springfield in springfield massachusetts mgm springfield is being developed on approximately 14 acres of land in downtown springfield mgm’s plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 2550 slots and 120 table games including poker a 250room hotel 100000 square feet of retail and restaurant space 44000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 3500 space parking garage with an expected development and construction cost of approximately 960 million excluding capitalized interest and landrelated costs construction of mgm springfield is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018

in august 2015 we announced the implementation of a profit growth plan for sustained growth and margin enhancement the profit growth plan’s initiatives focused on improving business processes to leverage our scale for greater efficiency and lower costs and to identify areas of opportunity to organically drive incremental revenue growth the profit growth plan included a large number of initiatives to optimize operations and in 2017 we transitioned from the profit growth plan to a continuous improvement approach to explore additional opportunities to drive further improvement 

formation and initial public offering of mgp 

 

on april 25 2016 mgm growth properties llc “mgp” a consolidated subsidiary completed its initial public offering “ipo” mgp is organized as an umbrella partnership reit commonly referred to as an “upreit” structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through the operating partnership mgp has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares collectively the “shares” class a shares and a single class b share 

 

we own mgp’s class b share which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of mgp or upon liquidation or winding up of mgp mgp’s class a shareholders are entitled to one vote per share while we as the owner of the class b share are entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of mgp’s shares so long as our and our controlled affiliates’ excluding mgp’s aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in mgp and the operating partnership does not fall below 30 the sole general part ner of the operating partnership is also a subsidiary of mgp 

 

in connection with the formation of mgp mgp used the proceeds from the ipo to purchase operating partnership units in the operating partnership concurrently we contributed the real estate assets associated with the mirage mandalay bay luxor new yorknew york monte carlo excalibur the park gold strike tunica mgm grand detroit and beau rivage to the operating partnership in exchange for operating partnership units a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership the “landlord” subsequently leased the properties to a subsidiary of ours the “tenant” pursuant to a longterm triplenet master lease agreement the “master lease” 

 

in august 2016 we completed the acquisition of boyd gaming corporation’s “boyd gaming” ownership interest in borgata at which time borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of ours subsequently mgp acquired borgata’s real property from us and in october 2017 mgp also acquired the longterm leasehold interest and real property associated with mgm national harbor from us amendments to the master lease agreement provided that we then lease the real estate assets of borgata and mgm national harbor from a subsidiary of the operating partnership as of december 31 2017 we owned 734 of the operating partnership units and mgp held the remaining 266 ownership interest in the operating partnership

 

see note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding mgp and its subsidiaries which we consolidate in our financial statements and from which we lease certain of our real estate assets pursuant to a master lease agreement all intercompany transactions including transactions under the master lease have been eliminated in consolidation

reportable segments 

we have two reportable segments domestic resorts and mgm china we currently own and operate 14 resorts in the united states mgm china’s operations consist of mgm macau resort and mgm cotai on the cotai strip in macau we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results 

domestic resorts at december 31 2017 our domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts 

 



over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services and the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally 

key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our domestic resorts are 



 



mgm china we own an approximate 56 controlling interest in mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns and operates mgm macau and mgm cotai the related gaming subconcession and land concessions we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability 

revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walkin and day trip visitors unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main floor segment have become an increasingly significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future 

vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the nonnegotiable chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate  they also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate which can be applied to hotel rooms food and beverage and other discretionary customersrelated expenses the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue 

in addition to the key performance indicators used by our domestic resorts mgm macau utilizes “turnover” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is typically in the range of 27 to 30 of turnover win for main floor gaming operations at mgm macau is typically in the range of 1622 of table games drop

income taxes the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 



 

our effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by a nonrecurring noncash income tax benefit of 14 billion resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities required as a result of the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryovers and permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on the borgata transaction partially offset

cash taxes paid increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased us taxable income and state income taxes attributable to borgata which has been consolidated since the august 2016 acquisition of boyd gaming’s interest in the company cash taxes paid increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased us taxable income

 

nongaap measures 

 

“adjusted ebitda” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses nv energy exit expense gain on borgata transaction goodwill impairment charges and property transactions net “adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts and mgp stock compensation plans which are not allocated to each property mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stockbased compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china “samestore adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted property ebitda related to the operating resorts which were consolidated by the company for both the entire current and prior year periods presented “adjusted ebitda margin” is adjusted ebitda divided by net revenues “samestore adjusted property ebitda margin” is samestore adjusted property ebitda divided by “samestore” net revenues adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies we present adjusted property ebitda on a “samestore” basis as supplemental information because management believes that providing performance measures on a “samestore” basis is useful for evaluating the periodtoperiod performance of our domestic casino resorts

 

we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda samestore adjusted property ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and samestore adjusted property ebitda margin may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda and samestore adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of domestic resorts operating performance 

 

adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda samestore adjusted property ebitda adjusted ebitda margin or samestore adjusted property ebitda margin should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or net income as indicators of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda samestore adjusted property ebitda adjusted ebitda margin or samestore adjusted property ebitda margin also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda samestore adjusted property ebitda adjusted ebitda margin or samestore adjusted property ebitda margin information may calculate adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda samestore adjusted property ebitda adjusted ebitda margin or samestore adjusted property ebitda margin in a different manner

anticipated uses of cash we have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures at december 31 2017 we had 130 billion in principal amount of indebtedness including 373 million of borrowings outstanding under our 15 billion senior secured credit facility 21 billion outstanding under the 27 billion operating partnership credit facility and 23 billion outstanding under the 29 billion mgm china credit facility in the next twelve months we have due an estimated 710 million of cash interest payments and 820 million of term loan principal payments of which approximately 774 million relates to mgm china’s existing credit facility mgm china is in the process of amending its credit facility to extend the maturity date extend the timing of and reduce the amount of scheduled amortization payments and increase the maximum leverage ratio we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facilities 

 

in addition we have made significant investments through december 31 2017 and we expect to make capital investments as described below during 2018 see “executive overview” for further information regarding the scope and timing of our significant development projects

 









 

our capital expenditures fluctuate depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure of our ownership interests in future developments 

 

mgm resorts international stock repurchase program in september 2017 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated agreements the timing volume and nature of stock repurchases will be at the sole discretion of management dependent on market conditions applicable securities laws and other factors and may be suspended or discontinued at any time repurchased shares are retired the remaining availability under the stock repurchase program was approximately 672 million as of december 31 2017

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates 

 

 

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the united states mgm china performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit at december 31 2017 and 2016 approximately 60 and 49 respectively of our gross casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from the united states

 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at domestic resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at domestic resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer 

 

in addition to enforceability issues the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables net of discounts 

 



 

approximately 31 million and 35 million of casino receivables and 7 million and 8 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due to a decrease in the age of outstanding account balances at december 31 2017 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 3 million

 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

 

property and equipment are stated at cost a significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

 

 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets w e must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we det ermine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the ch ange prospectively 

 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses

 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin 

 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks for our 2017 annual impairment test we utilized the option to perform a qualitative “step zero” analysis for certain of our indefinitelived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin we elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the borgata trade name using a discounted cash flow approach for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 4 for our 2016 and 2015 annual impairment tests we utilized the twostep quantitative analysis for all of our intangible assets using a discounted cash flow approach for license rights and using the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks the estimated fair values of the intangibles were substantially in excess of their carrying values with the fair value of the borgata trade name exceeding its carrying value by approximately 2 reflecting the recentness of the borgata transaction as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in an impairment charge 

 

we review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances with the exception of our mgm china reporting unit discussed below none of our other reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2017 2016 or 2015 for our 2017 annual goodwill impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for all of our domestic resorts reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values we utilized the quantitative analysis for the mgm china reporting unit for which the fair value of such reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin for our 2016 annual impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our domestic resorts reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin the estimated fair values of reporting units for which we elected to forego the step zero analysis and instead utilized the twostep quantitative analysis were substantially in excess of their carrying values as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge

 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units including our mgm china reporting unit the step one goodwill analysis of the mgm china reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4 the decrease in fair value resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the mgm china reporting unit as well as those of the mgm china reporting unit’s peer group as a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis we proceeded to perform a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss as such we determined the fair values of all assets of the mgm china reporting unit including its separately identifiable intangible assets the fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill therefore we recorded a 15 billion noncash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit to its implied fair value in 2015 

 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of multiples capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

 

see note 2 and note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets

 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

 

see note 7 and note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of otherthantemporary impairment 

 

income taxes 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied

 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities

 

we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in “other accrued liabilities” or longterm in “other longterm liabilities” based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

 

refer to note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes

 

market risk 

 

in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the operating partnership’s term loan b facility a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions

 

as of december 31 2017 variable rate borrowings represented approximately 27 of our total borrowings after giving effect to the 500 million and 700 million notional amount operating partnership interest rate swaps with w eighted average fixed rates that we pay 1764 and 1901 respectively the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above 

 



 

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states china macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the us dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof as of december 31 2017 a 1 increase in the hong kong dollar the functional currency of mgm china to the us dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by 7 million and a 1 decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by 23 million

resort operations 

 

general 

 

our casino resorts offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development acquisitions or investments and repay debt financings

 

we believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests the quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards both domestic and globally including several four and five diamond designations from the american automobile association as well as multiple four and five star designations from forbes travel guide 

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results 

 

 

al l of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our domestic resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we utilize thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs we lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible

domestic resorts over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy an d customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 

 

our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race and sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere 

 

mgm china we acquired an additional 495 interest in mgm china holdings limited “mgm china” on september 1 2016 which increased our ownership to approximately 56 we have a controlling interest in mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise sa “mgm grand paradise” the macau company that owns and operates the mgm macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concession we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at mgm macau and our future property on the cotai strip 

 

our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai discussed further below revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau sa and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations

 

in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop mgm cotai on an approximately 18 acre site on the cotai strip the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to build and open mgm cotai by january 2018

 

construction of mgm cotai commenced in 2013 and it is expected to open in the second half of 2017 china state construction engineering corporation serves as the sole general contractor for the project mgm cotai will be an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1500 slots and featuring approximately 1500 hotel rooms the actual number of gaming tables allocated to mgm cotai will be determined by the macau government prior to opening and such allocation is expected to be less than our 500 gaming table capacity the total estimated project budget is 33 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs 

 

customers and competition 

 

our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally 

 

our primary methods of successful competition include 

 











 

domestic resorts our customers include premium gaming customers leisure and wholesale travel customers business travelers and group customers including conventions trade associations and small meetings we have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and valueoriented tour and travel customers many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during midweek and offpeak periods 

 

 

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the las vegas strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 149300 and 149200 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively at december 31 2016 we operated approximately 27 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 429 million in 2016 a 15 increase from the 423 million reported for 2015 major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in las vegas also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas

 

outside nevada our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in atlantic city new jersey we compete with other atlantic city casinos as well as casinos in pennsylvania and maryland in washington dc we compete with other maryland casinos as well as casinos in pennsylvania and new jersey in biloxi and tunica mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas

 

mgm china the three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market are vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services gaming promoters operate vip gaming rooms within the property in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate these clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future to target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which include both table games and slots to the main floor gaming area the amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players 

 

our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally we face competition at our macau and cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations primarily on the cotai strip with several openings having occurred during 2016 and additional openings expected during 2017

 

we encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of asia and around the world including singapore korea australia new zealand malaysia vietnam cambodia the philippines russia cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region 

 

corporate and other much like our domestic resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts aria which we manage and own 50 through citycenter appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our domestic casino resorts and other resorts on the las vegas strip grand victoria our other unconsolidated affiliate mainly competes for customers against casino resorts in the chicago metropolitan market

risk factors 

tableend

 

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below

 

risks relating to our substantial indebtedness

 



 

in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us including

 











 

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished and under the master lease we are required to spend an aggregate amount of at least 1 of actual adjusted net revenues from the properties included under the master lease on capital expenditures at those properties such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly development projects including our development project in massachusetts and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 



 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2018 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives 

 

would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements 

 



 















 

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger crossdefaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness in addition our senior secured credit facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants including a maximum total net leverage ratio a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt

 

in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and the operating partnership and mgm national harbor llc are each borrowers under their respective senior secured credit facilities all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions in particular these credit agreements require mgm china the operating partnership and mgm national harbor llc to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm china the operating partnership and mgm national harbor llc and each of their subsidiaries including with respect to mgm china mgm grand paradise respectively these restrictions include among other things limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets

 



 













 

 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse e ffect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to our business

 



 

in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos such as has happened in california for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia including singapore korea australia new zealand malaysia vietnam cambodia the philippines russia cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and unlicensed gaming operations certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including japan and others such as taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities for example the facilities currently being developed in cotai macau are expected to increase total hotel room inventory by 10 through 2018 and significantly increase other gaming and nongaming offerings in macau we would face increased competition 

 

most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions including illinois have legalized video gaming terminals the expansion of online gaming and other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts

 

in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow

 



 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in 

 

the property state regulatory a gencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also requir e the approval of certain regulatory authorities 

 

in macau current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm china’s interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm china’s activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues

 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos similarly in october 2014 casinos in macau including mgm china implemented a smoking ban which prohibits smoking on all mass market gaming floors and in 2015 the macau health bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposing a full smoking ban in casinos including in vip rooms the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance

 

we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations for instance we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970 commonly known as the “bank secrecy act” which among other things requires us to report to the internal revenue service “irs” any currency transactions in excess of 10000 that occur within a 24hour gaming day including identification of the individuals involved in the currency transaction we are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know suspect or have reason to suspect transactions among other things involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose in addition under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting recordkeeping and retention our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic examinations by the irs any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws including the bank secrecy act or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 



 



 

in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements including market impacts resulting from china’s recent anticorruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by nonbank lending entities and crossborder currency monitoring including increased restrictions on union pay withdrawals and other atm limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau andor the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino for example from 2008 through 2010 china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period in addition effective october 2013 china banned “zero‑fare” tour groups involving no or low upfront payments and compulsory shopping which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland china and in december 2014 the chinese government tightened the enforcement of visa transit rules for those seeking to enter macau at the gongbei border including requirements to present an airplane ticket to a destination country a visa issued by such destination country and a valid chinese passport it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau

furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resorts certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications for instance the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase in addition limitations on the number of gaming tables permitted by the macau government could impact our current expectation on the number of table games we will be able to utilize at our cotai project such limitations or reduction in table game availability may impact mgm china’s results of operations finally because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai macau could be negatively impacted 

 



 



 

 



 



 



 



 

 

mgp’s operating agreement however provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries  on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any resolution or course of action by mgp’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to mgp if it is i app roved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors which mgp refers to as “special approval” such independence determined in accordance with the nyse’s listing standards the standards established by the exchan ge act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement ii determined by mgp’s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to mgp or iii approved by the affirmative vo te of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates furthermore that mgp’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value individually o r in the aggregate over 25 million between us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries on the one hand and mgp or any of its subsidiaries on the other hand any such transaction other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates other than mgp and its subsidiaries under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of mgp’s formation transactions a “threshold transaction” shall be permitted only if i special approval is obtained or ii such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of mgp’s outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates 

 

as a result certain transactions including any threshold transactions that we may want to pursue with mgp and that could have significant benefit to us may require special approval there can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent mgp directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates the failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives

 



 



 

furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradise’s compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

 

in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradise’s casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau g overnment may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compen sation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest dep reciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues 

 



 



 

in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradise’s standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations

 

we also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans 

 



 



 



 



 



 

while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations

 

furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers

 

even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results

 

 





 



 

for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our coinvestor are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenter’s indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio as defined in citycenter’s third amended and restated credit facility for each quarter we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test

 



 

any of our future construction development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks including

 

















 















 

the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake for instance we currently expect the total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately 33 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and landrelated costs and we currently expect total development costs of our massachusetts project to be approximately 865 million excluding capitalized interest and landrelated costs while we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects including our developments in cotai and massachusetts will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted or that the expected design and features of current or future projects will not change in addition the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines and any such deadlines are not extended we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 



 

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 

 

we renew our insurance policies other than our builder’s risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage

 



 



 



 



 

























 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 

we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us including accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of customer and employee information such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly however they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats in addition while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event such coverage may not be sufficient  

 

we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyber attacks or otherwise could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations for instance there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed our information systems and records including those we maintain with our thirdparty service providers may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future in addition our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a thirdparty service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation cause a material disruption to our operations and management team and result in remediation expenses regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

 



 











 



 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances 

 

in addition we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are noncore no longer complement our business are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums from time to time we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets there can be no assurance however that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all

the state and federal court derivative actions were dismissed pursuant to defendants’ motions in november 2009 the us district court for nevada consolidated the remaining cases robert lowinger v mgm mirage et al case no 209cv01558rcl

management’s discussion and analysis of financial c ondition and results of operations 

tableend

executive overview 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities

during the year ended december 31 2016 las vegas visitor volume increased 1 las vegas strip revpar increased 6 and las vegas strip gaming revenue increased by less than 1 compared to the prior year period according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority results of operations for our domestic resorts during 2016 benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and revpar and the results of our profit growth plan discussed below our rooms revenue benefited from increased visitation to the las vegas market and robust convention business at our las vegas strip resorts which allowed us to yield higher room rates across our portfolio of resorts

gross gaming revenues in the macau market decreased 3 in 2016 compared to 2015 and gross gaming revenues decreased 34 in 2015 compared to 2014 as a significant number of mgm macau’s customers are from mainland china we believe operating results were negatively affected by economic conditions in mainland china as well as certain policy initiatives in mainland china and macau specifically a continuing slowdown in china’s economic growth rate the chinese government’s restrictions on travel and crossborder currency transactions new compliance regulations for gaming promoters and gaming operators enacted by the macau government and implemented in late 2015 and in 2016 and a ban on mobile phone usage at gaming tables in an attempt to eliminate “proxy” bets have all negatively affected mgm macau’s highend customers and the gaming promoters with which we conduct our vip casino gaming operations in addition the chinese government’s anticorruption campaign has changed consumption patterns and affected the propensity of our clients to spend on certain areas like gaming or luxury items the macau government also implemented a full main floor casino smoking ban in october 2014 these factors led to a continued decrease in gross gaming revenues for the macau market beginning in the second half of 2014 and lasted into 2016 primarily impacting vip casino gaming operations and to a lesser extent main floor operations throughout the macau market despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in china we expect the macau market to grow on a longterm basis due to further development penetration of the mainland china market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau and we believe recent trends reflect stabilization within the macau market according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government after several quarters of declines in visitation throughout 2015 visitor arrivals increased slightly by 1 and overnight visitors increased 10 in 2016 compared to 2015 additionally gross gaming revenue increased year over year in each of the months from august 2016 through december 2016

our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities in macau we estimate costs to develop mgm cotai will be approximately 33 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs mgm cotai is a casino resort with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1500 slots and featuring approximately 1500 hotel rooms built on an approximately 18 acre site on the cotai strip in macau the actual number of gaming tables allocated to mgm cotai will be determined by the macau government prior to opening and such allocation is expected to be less than our 500 gaming table capacity mgm cotai is expected to open in the second half of 2017

we were awarded a casino license to build and operate mgm springfield in springfield massachusetts mgm springfield will be developed on approximately 14 acres of land in downtown springfield mgm’s plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3000 slots and 100 table games including poker a 250room hotel 100000 square feet of retail and restaurant space 44000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 3375space parking garage with an expected development and construction cost of approximately 865 million excluding capitalized interest and landrelated costs construction of mgm springfield is expected to be completed in late 2018

in august 2015 we announced the implementation of a profit growth plan for sustained growth and margin enhancement the profit growth plan’s initiatives focused on improving business processes to leverage our scale for greater efficiency and lower costs and to identify areas of opportunity to organically drive incremental revenue growth the profit growth plan included a large number of initiatives to optimize operations and we continue to explore additional opportunities to drive further improvement in june 2016 

 

we announced that we expect to achieve approximately 400 million of annualized adjusted ebitda benefit compared to our baseline which we expect to be fully realized by the end of 2017 

formation and initial public offering of mgp 

on april 25 2016 mgm growth properties llc “mgp” completed its ipo of 57500000 of its class a shares representing limited liability company interests inclusive of the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 7500000 class a shares at an initial offering price of 21 per share mgp used the proceeds from the ipo to purchase operating partnership units in mgm growth properties operating partnership lp the “operating partnership” to which we contributed the real estate assets associated with the mirage mandalay bay luxor new yorknew york monte carlo excalibur the park gold strike tunica mgm grand detroit and beau rivage in exchange for operating partnership units in the operating partnership in connection with the ipo

in connection with the formation of mgp we borrowed 40 billion under certain bridge facilities the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding obligations under our prior senior credit facility and to redeem our 75 senior notes due 2016 and our 10 senior notes due 2016 the bridge facilities were subsequently assumed by the operating partnership pursuant to the master contribution agreement the operating partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of proceeds from certain financing transactions and the proceeds from the ipo

on august 1 2016 we completed the acquisition of boyd gaming corporation’s “boyd gaming” ownership interest in borgata at which time borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of ours accordingly we recorded a gain of approximately 430 million as a result of the acquisition of borgata and resulting consolidation of borgata which we previously accounted for under the equity method see note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information following completion of the acquisition mgp subsequently acquired borgata’s real property from a subsidiary of ours in exchange for mgp’s assumption of 545 million of indebtedness from our subsidiary and the issuance of 274 million operating partnership units to our subsidiary in connection with the borgata transaction we borrowed 545 million under certain bridge facilities which were subsequently contributed to the operating partnership the operating partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on their revolving credit facility which it subsequently refinanced with proceeds from its offering of its 45 senior notes due 2026 pursuant to an amendment to the master lease mgp leased back the real property of borgata to a subsidiary of ours and as a result initial rent payments to mgp increased by 100 million prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the borgata transaction consistent with the master lease terms 90 of this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2 per year until 2022

reportable segments 

we have two reportable segments domestic resorts and mgm china we currently own and operate 14 resorts in the united states mgm china’s operations consist of mgm macau resort and the development of mgm cotai on the cotai strip in macau we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results 

 

domestic resorts at december 31 2016 our domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts 

 



over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services and the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally 

key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our domestic resorts are 





mgm china subsequent to the acquisition of an additional 495 of the outstanding common shares of our mgm china subsidiary in september 2016 we own an approximate 56 controlling interest in mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns and operates mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions and is in the process of developing mgm cotai we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability 

revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walkin and day trip visitors unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main floor segment have become an increasingly significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future 

vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the nonnegotiable chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate  they also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate which can be applied to hotel rooms food and beverage and other discretionary customersrelated expenses the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue 

 

in addition to the key performance ind icators used by our domestic resorts mgm macau utilizes “turnover” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned turnover p rovides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is typically in the range of 27 to 30 of turnover 

corporate and other corporate and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations see note 1 and note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company’s unconsolidated affiliates

in 2016 our share of citycenter’s operating results including certain basis difference adjustments was 445 million which included 13 million related to our share of nv energy exit expense representing citycenter’s share of a charge associated with our strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of nv energy 41 million related to our share of accelerated depreciation related to the april 2016 closure of the zarkana theatre as well as 401 million related to our share of a gain recognized by citycenter on the sale of crystals and the reversal of certain basis differences at aria casino revenues decreased 2 in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a 7 decrease in table games volume partially offset by an increase in hold percentage to 246 in 2016 compared to 238 in 2015 the decrease in table games revenue was partially offset by a 2 increase in slots revenue revpar increased by 4 and 8 at aria and vdara respectively which led to a 7 increase in citycenter’s rooms revenue in 2016 compared to 2015

nonoperating results 

 

interest expense the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt 

 



 

in 2016 interest cost related to mgm resorts excluding mgm china decreased compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average longterm debt outstanding and also due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate partially offset by an increase in amortization of debt issuance cost associated with the mgp related financing transactions in april 2016 interest cost related to mgm china increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the mgm china credit facility partially offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs in 2015 interest cost related to mgm resorts excluding china decreased compared to 2014 as a result of a decrease in the average longterm debt outstanding during the year related to our senior notes interest cost related to mgm china increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the mgm china credit facility and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from costs incurred associated with the refinancing of the mgm china credit facility in june 2015

income taxes the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 



 

our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryovers and permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on the borgata transaction partially offset by income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the macau complementary tax on gaming profits our effective tax rate in 2015 was unfavorably impacted by the noncash impairment charge on mgm china goodwill for which we did not record income tax benefit our effective tax rate decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of providing greater tax benefit in 2015 than in 2014 for foreign tax credits net of valuation allowance partially offset by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements in 2014

 

 

cash taxes paid increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased us taxable income cash taxes paid decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a 16 million refund of taxes and associated interest received in 2015 on the closure of the irs examination of citycenter which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes which partially offset federal income tax estimated tax payments of 23 million made during the year the remaining 5 million of cash taxes paid in 2015 consist of state and foreign income taxes 

 

nongaap measures 

 

“adjusted ebitda” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses nv energy exit expense gain on borgata transaction goodwill impairment charges and property transactions net “adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to both the mgm resorts and mgp stockbased compensation plans which are not allocated to each reportable segment or operating segment as applicable mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stockbased compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china “samestore adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted property ebitda related to the operating resorts which were consolidated by the company for both the entire current and prior year periods presented adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies we present adjusted property ebitda on a “samestore” basis as supplemental information for investors because management believes that providing performance measures on a “samestore” basis is useful for evaluating the periodtoperiod performance of our domestic casino resorts

 

we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda and samestore adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda and samestore adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of domestic resorts operating performance 

 

adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda or samestore adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda or samestore adjusted property ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda or samestore adjusted property ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda adjusted property ebitda or samestore adjusted property ebitda in a different manner

our cash flows consisted of the following 

 



 

cash flows 

 

operating activities trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income excluding noncash charges but can be affected by changes in working capital cash paid for interest the timing of significant tax payments or refunds and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates cash provided by operating activities was 15 billion in 2016 compared to 10 billion in 2015 operating cash flows increased in the current period due to an increase in operating income at our domestic resorts and a decrease in cash paid for interest partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes cash provided by operating activities in the prior year was negatively affected by changes in working capital primarily related to shortterm gaming liabilities 

 

cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased due to a decrease in operating cash flows at mgm china which were 383 million in 2015 compared to 642 million in 2014 partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows at our domestic resorts

off balance sheet arrangements 

 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter grand victoria and las vegas arena company llc we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than our mgp cash flow hedges see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort or other entertainment properties in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we guarantee the tmobile arena credit facility as described below in addition there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort 

 

in conjunction with the las vegas arena company llc entering into a senior secured credit facility in september 2014 we and aeg each entered into joint and several completion guarantees for the project which were subsequently terminated in february 2017 as well as a repayment guarantee for the term loan b which is subject to increases and decreases in the event of a rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan a and term loan b facilities as of december 31 2016 term loan a was 150 million and term loan b was 50 million

 

commitments and contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 

 



 











 

while we have significant indebtedness and other obligations we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits cash flows from operations dividends and distributions from mgm china and the 

 

operating partnership and availability under our senior credit facility the mgm china credit facility the operating partnership credit facility and the mgm national harbor c redit facility we have 138 million of maturities of longterm debt in 2017 see “liquidity and capital resources – other factors affecting liquidity” for further discussion of anticipated uses of cash 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates 

 

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau at december 31 2016 and 2015 approximately 53 and 42 respectively of our casino accounts receivable at our domestic resorts were owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2016 and 2015 approximately 35 and 37 respectively of our casino accounts receivable at our domestic resorts were owed by customers from the far east we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the united states mgm china performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit

 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at domestic resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at domestic resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer 

 

in addition to enforceability issues the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables 

 



 

approximately 35 million and 40 million of casino receivables and 8 million and 9 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively casino receivables increased in the 

 

current year as a result of the borgata transaction and the opening of mgm nationa l harbor the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due to a decrease in the age of outstanding account balances at december 31 2016 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 3 million 

 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

 

property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the august 2016 borgata acquisition the june 2011 mgm china acquisition the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses

 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin 

 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets

 

 

goodwill repre sents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations we test goodwill for relevant reporting units for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and in interim periods if circumstances exist suc h that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value accounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill commonly referred to as “step zero” in order to determi ne whether further impairment testing is necessary in performing the step zero analysis we take into account macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations current and forecasted financial performance entityspecific events and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units in addition management takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed as well as the pe riod of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value further quantitative analysis is not required if the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the entity would proceed to a twostep quantitative analysis 

 

under the twostep quantitative analysis goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an indication of impairment exists and we must proceed to measure an impairment loss if any in measuring an impairment loss the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining if any is the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value

 

with the exception of our mgm china reporting unit discussed below none of our other reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2016 2015 or 2014 for our 2016 annual impairment test we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our domestic resorts reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin the estimated fair values of reporting units for which we elected to forego the step zero analysis and instead utilized the twostep quantitative analysis were substantially in excess of their carrying values as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge

 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units including our mgm china reporting unit the step one goodwill analysis of the mgm china reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4 the decrease in fair value resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the mgm china reporting unit as well as those of the mgm china reporting unit’s peer group as a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis we proceeded to perform a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss as such we determined the fair values of all assets of the mgm china reporting unit including its separately identifiable intangible assets the fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill therefore we recorded a 15 billion noncash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit to its implied fair value in 2015

 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of multiples capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

 

see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment 

 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

 

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group see note 7 and note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of otherthantemporary impairment charges 

 

 

income taxes 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied 

 

as of december 31 2016 we have a foreign tax credit carryover of 28 billion against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of 25 billion based upon our assessment of future realization the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35 of gross gaming revenue in macau because mgm grand paradise is presently exempt from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits we believe that payment of the macau special gaming tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against us taxes 

 

on september 7 2016 mgm grand paradise was granted an additional extension of the complementary tax exemption through march 31 2020 concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession a competitor of mgm grand paradise subsequently received an additional extension of its exemption through march 31 2020 which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming concession based upon these developments and the uncertainty concerning taxation after the concession renewal process we have concluded that we can no longer assume that mgm grand paradise will be entitled to additional exemption periods beyond the end of the extension recently granted thus for all periods beyond march 31 2020 we have assumed that mgm grand paradise will pay the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the macau special gaming tax in such years and have factored that assumption into our assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and the measurement of macau deferred tax liabilities 

 

due to improvements in our us operations we have generated us operating profits for the past eight consecutive quarters and as of june 30 2016 we no longer had cumulative us losses in recent years consequently during 2016 we began to rely on future us source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization during the 10year foreign tax credit carryover period 

 

our assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from mgm china and assumptions concerning future us operating profits as a result significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance for example a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china or a change in our assumptions concerning us profitability could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period in addition should we in a future period actually receive an additional exemption from the complementary tax an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material 

 

in addition there is a 3 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets a valuation allowance of 71 million on certain macau deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 2 million on hong kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition 

 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities

 

we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in “other accrued liabilities” or longterm in “other longterm liabilities” based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted share units “rsus” compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 

 

we account for performance stock units “psus” measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model and monte carlo valuation model our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the blackscholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions including volatility to determine the fair value of the award changes in the subjective assumptions can material ly affect the estimate of the fair value of sharebased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year 

 

market risk 

 

in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions 

in december 2016 the operating partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan b facility these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and have a notional value of 500 million and mature on november 30 2021 the weighted average fixed rate paid is 1825 and the variable rate received resets monthly to the onemonth libor subject to a minimum rate of 075 in january 2017 the operating partnership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements through november 2021 with a total 700 million notional amount to pay a fixed rate of 1964 and receive the 1month libor rate in order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan b facility the company does not currently have any master netting arrangements related to its derivative contracts see note 11 for additional information

as of december 31 2016 variable rate borrowings represented approximately 32 of our total borrowings after giving effect to the 500 million notional amount operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of the mgp term loan b facility over the 075 floor specified in the operating partnership credit facility and after giving effect to the 500 million notional amount operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above our annual interest cost would increase by 23 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2016 assuming a 100 basispoint increase in hibor for the mgm china credit facility our annual interest cost would increase by 19 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2016 the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above 

 



 

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states china macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the us dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof as of december 31 2016 a 1 increase in the hong kong dollar the functional currency of mgm china to the us dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by 4 million and a 1 decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by 20 million

reportable segments

 

we have two reportable segments based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments within the regions in which they operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 12 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm china’s operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino “mgm macau” and the development of an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort on the cotai strip in macau we have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter holdings llc “citycenter” is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee see “resort operations” below as well as “executive overview” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 16 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our segments

 

resort operations 

 

general 

 

our casino resorts offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings

 

we believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate as discussed above ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests the quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards both domestic and globally including several four and five diamond designations from the american automobile association as well as multiple four and five star designations from forbes travel guide 

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming 

 

 

customers and the level o f play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in o ur results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our result s 

 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our wholly owned domestic resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we utilize thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs we lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible 

 

our operating resorts 

 

we have provided certain information below about our resorts as of december 31 2015 except as otherwise indicated we wholly own and operate the resorts shown below 

 



 



 



















 

more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 

 

 

 

wholly owned domestic resorts over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 

 

our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race and sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere 

 

mgm china we own a 51 controlling interest in mgm china holdings limited “mgm china” which owns mgm grand paradise sa “mgm grand paradise” the macau company that owns and operates the mgm macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concession we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the asian gaming market 

 

our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and the development of an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort on the cotai strip in macau discussed further below revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau sa and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations

 

in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 18 acre site on the cotai strip in macau “mgm cotai” the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to build and open mgm cotai by january 2018

 

construction of mgm cotai commenced in 2013 and it is anticipated to open at the end of the first quarter of 2017 china state construction engineering corporation serves as the sole general contractor for the project mgm cotai will be an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1500 slots and featuring approximately 1500 hotel rooms the actual number of gaming tables allocated to mgm cotai will be determined by the macau government prior to opening and such allocation may be less than our 500 gaming table capacity the total estimated project budget is 30 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs 

 

customers and competition 

 

our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally 

 

our primary methods of successful competition include 

 











 

wholly owned domestic resorts our customers include premium gaming customers leisure and wholesale travel customers business travelers and group customers including conventions trade associations and small meetings we have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and valueoriented tour and travel customers many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during midweek and offpeak periods 

 

 

 

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 149200 and 150500 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively at december 31 2015 we operated approximately 27 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 423 million in 2015 a 29 increase from the 411 million reported for 2014 major competitors including new entrants have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or are currently expanding their capacity or constructing new resorts in las vegas also the growth of gaming in areas outside las vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas

 

outside nevada our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas

 

mgm china the three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market are vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services gaming promoters operate vip gaming rooms within the property in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate these clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future to target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which include both table games and slots to the main floor gaming area the amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players 

 

our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally we face competition at our macau and cotai properties from several concessionaires who have expansion plans announced or underway primarily on the cotai strip with several expected openings in 2016 and 2017

 

we expect competition in the macau market to continue to increase as more capacity is brought online in the near future we also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of asia and around the world including singapore malaysia the philippines australia new zealand las vegas cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region 

 

corporate and other much like our wholly owned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts aria which we manage and own 50 through citycenter appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our wholly owned casino resorts and other resorts on the las vegas strip our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets

risk factors  

tableend

 

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below

 

risks relating to our substantial indebtedness

 



 

in addition our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us including

 











 

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly development projects including the tmobile arena project and our development projects in massachusetts and maryland and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 



 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2016 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements

 

 

 



 















 

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger crossdefaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt

 

in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and mgm national harbor llc is the borrower under a senior secured credit facility each of which contains covenants that restrict their ability to engage in certain transactions in particular the mgm china credit facility and the mgm national harbor llc senior secured credit facility require mgm china and mgm national harbor llc as applicable to satisfy various financial covenants including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio these agreements also impose certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm china and mgm national harbor llc and each of their subsidiaries including with respect to mgm china mgm grand paradise including among other things limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets

 

risks related to our business

 



 

the completion of the proposed reit transaction and ipo is subject to numerous conditions and the finalization of terms relating to the transactions which are subject to a number of variables including changes in market conditions and may not occur on favorable terms or at all we have not yet determined the number of shares that will be sold in the proposed ipo or the valuation of such shares therefore the amount of cash we expect to raise in connection with the proposed ipo and related transactions and the degree to which we are able to reduce our indebtedness is uncertain

 

in connection with the proposed reit transaction and ipo

 









 

 



 



 

in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos such as has happened in california for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia including singapore australia new zealand cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and unlicensed gaming operations certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including malaysia vietnam cambodia the philippines and russia and others such as japan taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities for example the facilities currently being developed in cotai macau are expected to increase total hotel room inventory by 30 and significantly increase other gaming and nongaming offerings in macau we would face increased competition 

 

most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions have legalized video gaming terminals the expansion of online gaming and other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts

 

in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow

 



 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we 

 

 

would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the property state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities 

 

in macau current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm china’s interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm china’s activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues

 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos similarly in october 2014 casinos in macau including mgm china implemented a smoking ban which prohibits smoking on all mass market gaming floors and in 2015 the macau health bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposing a full smoking ban in casinos including in vip rooms the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance

 

we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations for instance we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970 commonly known as the bank secrecy act which among other things requires us to report to the internal revenue service irs any currency transactions in excess of 10000 that occur within a 24hour gaming day including identification of the individuals involved in the currency transaction we are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know suspect or have reason to suspect transactions among other things involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose in addition under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting recordkeeping and retention our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic examinations by the irs any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws including the bank secrecy act or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 



 

 



 

in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china’s current restrictions on travel and currency movements including market impacts resulting from china’s recent anticorruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by nonbank lending entities and crossborder currency monitoring including increased restrictions on union pay withdrawals could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau andor the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino for example from 2008 through 2010 china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period in addition effective october 2013 china banned “zero‑fare” tour groups involving no or low upfront payments and compulsory shopping which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland china and in december 2014 the chinese government tightened the enforcement of visa transit rules for those seeking to enter macau at the gongbei border including requirements to present an airplane ticket to a destination country a visa issued by such destination country and a valid chinese passport it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau

furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications for instance the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos in addition limitations on the number of gaming tables permitted by the macau government could impact our current expectation on the number of table games we will be able to utilize at our cotai project such limitations or reduction in table game availability may impact mgm china’s results of operations finally because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai macau could be negatively impacted

 



 



 

 

 



 

furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradise’s compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradise’s casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues

 



 



 

 



 

in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradise’s standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations

 

we also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans

 



 



 



 



 

 



 



 

while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations

 

furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers

 

even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results

 





 



 

 



 

for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our coinvestor are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenter’s indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio as defined in citycenter’s third amended and restated credit facility for each quarter we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test

 



 

any of our future construction development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks including

 





























 

the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake for instance we currently expect the total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately 30 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and landrelated costs we currently expect total development costs of our maryland project to be approximately 13 billion total development costs of our massachusetts project to be approximately 865 million and total development costs of our tmobile arena project to be approximately 350 million each excluding capitalized interest and land related costs while we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects including our developments in cotai maryland and massachusetts will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted or that the expected design and features of current or future projects will not change in addition the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines and any such deadlines are not extended we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 



 

 



 

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 

 

we renew our insurance policies other than our builder’s risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage

 



 



 



 

























 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 

 

 

we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease

 



 



 



 



 



 

compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our guests in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us including accidental loss inadvertent disclosure unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of customer and employee information such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly however they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats in addition while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event such coverage may not be sufficient  

 

we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyberattacks or otherwise could impact our ability to 

 

 

service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations for instance there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed our information systems and records inc luding those we maintain with our thirdparty service providers may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future in addition our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours and we do no t directly control any of such parties’ information security operations   a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a thirdparty service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation cause a material disruption to our operations and management team and result in remediation expenses regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks all of which could have a material adverse eff ect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

 



 













 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances

executive overview 

 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities

 

according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority las vegas visitor volume increased 3 las vegas strip revpar increased 3 and las vegas strip gaming revenue decreased less than 1 in the year ended december 31 2015 results of operations for our wholly owned domestic resorts during 2015 benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and revpar our rooms revenue benefited from increased visitation to the las vegas market and robust convention business at our las vegas strip resorts which resulted in increases in occupancy and allowed us to yield higher room rates across our portfolio of resorts

 

gross gaming revenues in the macau market decreased 34 in 2015 compared to 2014 we believe operating results have been negatively affected by economic conditions and certain policy initiatives in china and the implementation of a full main floor casino smoking ban in october 2014 additionally we believe stricter enforcement of entrance into macau via the use of transit visas as well as a decrease in duration of stay permitted for transit visa holders has negatively affected operating results however restrictions surrounding the use of transit visas were eased in july 2015 the decrease in gross gaming revenues accelerated during the second half of 2014 and continued throughout 2015 as macau has become an increasingly challenging and competitive market impacting primarily vip casino gaming operations and to a lesser extent main floor operations according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government visitor arrivals decreased 3 in 2015 compared to 2014 despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in china we expect the macau market to grow on a longterm basis due to further development and penetration of the mainland china market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau 

 

our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities in macau we plan to spend approximately 30 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs to develop mgm cotai a resort and casino with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1500 slots and featuring approximately 1500 hotel rooms built on an approximately 18 acre site on the cotai strip in macau the actual number of gaming tables allocated to mgm cotai will be determined by the macau government prior to opening and such allocation may be less than our 500 gaming table capacity mgm cotai is expected to open at the end of the first quarter of 2017

 

we were awarded the sixth and final casino license under current statutes in the state of maryland by the maryland video lottery facility location commission to build and operate mgm national harbor a destination casino resort in prince george’s county at national harbor which is a waterfront development located on the potomac river just outside of washington dc we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm national harbor to be approximately 13 billion excluding capitalized interest and land related costs we designed the resort to include a casino with approximately 3600 slots and 160 table games including poker a 300room hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool 93100 square feet of highend branded retail and fine and casual dining a 3000seat theater venue 50000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 4700space parking garage we expect mgm national harbor to open in the fourth quarter of 2016

 

we were awarded a casino license to build and operate mgm springfield in springfield massachusetts mgm springfield will be developed on approximately 14 acres of land in downtown springfield massachusetts mgm’s plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3000 slots and 100 table games including poker a 250room hotel 100000 square feet of retail and restaurant space 44000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 3375space parking garage with an expected development and construction cost of approximately 865 million excluding capitalized interest and landrelated costs construction of mgm springfield is expected to be completed in late 2018

 

we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of anschutz entertainment group inc “aeg” to design construct and operate an arena which will be located on a parcel of our land between frank sinatra drive and new yorknew york adjacent to the las vegas strip we and aeg each own 50 of las vegas arena company the developer of the arena in september 2014 a wholly 

 

 

owned subsidiary of las vegas arena company entered into a 200 million senior secured credit facility to finance const ruction of the arena the las vegas arena company recently entered into a multiyear naming rights agreement with tmobile tmobile arena will seat between 18000 and 20000 people and is scheduled to open in the april 2016 such development is estimated to cost approximately 350 million excluding capitalized interest and landrelated costs in addition we are building the park entertainment district which connects to new yorknew york monte carlo and tmobile arena 

 

in august 2015 we announced the implementation of a profit growth plan for sustained growth and margin enhancement the profit growth plan’s initiatives are focused on improving business processes to optimize our scale for greater efficiency and lower cost throughout our business and to identify areas of opportunity to organically drive incremental revenue growth the profit growth plan includes a large number of opportunities to enhance our business operations and we continue to explore additional opportunities to drive further margin enhancements the plan is expected to result in approximately 300 million of annualized adjusted ebitda benefit the profit growth plan has begun to show significant results and is expected to be fully realized by the end of 2017

 

on october 29 2015 we announced the formation of mgp as a newly formed subsidiary that we expect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” for us federal income tax purposes we intend to contribute to a newlyformed operating partnership that mgp will control through a general partner subsidiary the real estate associated with mandalay bay the mirage new yorknew york luxor monte carlo excalibur the park mgm grand detroit beau rivage and gold strike tunica collectively the “properties” we also intend to incur approximately 4 billion of debt to refinance a portion of the debt outstanding under our existing senior credit facility and senior notes which refinancing debt would be assumed by the operating partnership in connection with the reit transactions one of our subsidiaries will then lease the properties from mgp for use under a longterm “triple net” master lease agreement with a 10year term that includes four fiveyear extensions at our option we will guarantee our subsidiary’s obligations under the master lease we expect to retain through subsidiaries an approximate 70 economic interest in the new operating partnership as well as voting control of mgp through our ownership of a controlling share in mgp

 

reportable segments 

 

we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 12 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm china’s operations consist of mgm macau resort and the development of mgm cotai on the cotai strip in macau we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results 

 

wholly owned domestic resorts at december 31 2015 our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts 

 



 

over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services and the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally 

 

key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are 

 



 

 

 



 

mgm china we own a 51 controlling interest in mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns and operates mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions and is in the process of developing mgm cotai an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort on the cotai strip in macau we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability 

 

revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walkin and day trip visitors unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main floor segment have become an increasingly significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future 

 

vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the nonnegotiable chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are based on either a percentage of actual win plus a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the rolling chip turnover their customers generate or a percentage of the rolling chip turnover plus discounted offerings on nongaming amenities the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue 

 

in addition to the key performance indicators used by our wholly owned domestic resorts mgm macau utilizes “turnover” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is typically in the range of 27 to 30 of turnover

in 2015 interest cost related to mgm resorts excluding china decreased compared to 2014 as a result of a decrease in the average longterm debt outstanding during the year related to our senior notes interest cost related to mgm china increased in 2015 compared to the prior year due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the mgm china credit facility and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from costs incurred associated with the refinancing of the mgm china credit facility in june 2015 in 2014 interest cost related to mgm resorts excluding china decreased compared to 2013 as a result of a decrease in weighted average longterm debt outstanding during the year primarily relating to borrowings under our revolving credit facility amortization of debt discounts premiums and issuance costs included in interest expense in 2015 2014 and 2013 was 46 million 38 million and 35 million respectively

 

capitalized interest in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due primarily to the mgm cotai national harbor and springfield projects and our investment in the las vegas arena company capitalized interest in 2014 and 2013 primarily related to the mgm cotai project

 

nonoperating items from unconsolidated affiliates nonoperating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased 11 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to a decrease in interest expense at citycenter nonoperating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased 121 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a decrease in interest expense at citycenter as a result of debt restructuring transactions in october 2013 lower statutory interest recorded by citycenter related to estimated amounts owed in connection with the citycenter construction litigation and the net impact of the following other nonoperating items from unconsolidated affiliates recognized in 2013 a 70 million loss for our share of citycenter’s loss on retirement of longterm debt in october 2013 and 12 million for our share of a gain recognized on debt restructuring transactions at silver legacy 

 

income taxes the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 



 

our effective tax rate in 2015 was impacted by the noncash impairment charge on mgm china goodwill for which we did not record income tax benefit our effective tax rate decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of providing greater tax benefit in 2015 than in 2014 for foreign tax credits net of valuation allowance partially offset by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements in 2014 our effective tax rate increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the reduced tax benefit in 2014 for foreign tax credits net of valuation allowance partially offset by tax provision in 2013 resulting from remeasuring the macau net deferred tax liability due to the extension of the amortization period of the mgm china gaming subconcession upon effectiveness of the cotai land concession

 

cash taxes paid decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a 16 million refund of taxes and associated interest received in 2015 on the closure of the irs examination of citycenter which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes which partially offset federal income tax estimated tax payments of 23 million made during the year the remaining 5 

 

 

million of cash taxes paid in 2015 consist of state and foreign income taxes cash t axes paid increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of 30 million paid to irs for the closure of examinations covering the 2005 through 2009 tax years and 8 million estimated taxes paid to the irs during 2014 the remaining 4 million of cash taxes paid in 2014 consist of state and foreign income taxes cash taxes paid in 2013 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes 

 

nongaap measures 

 

“adjusted ebitda” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses and property transactions net “adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts stock option plan which is not allocated to each reportable segment or operating segment as applicable mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies

 

we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of wholly owned domestic resorts operating performance 

 

adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda in a different manner

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows – summary

 

we require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts in addition to required cash on hand for operations we utilize companywide cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central bank accounts and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility in addition from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt securities subject to limitations in our senior credit facility at december 31 2015 and 2014 we held cash and cash equivalents of 17 billion cash and cash equivalents related to mgm china at december 31 2015 and 2014 was 700 million and 546 million respectively 

 

 

 

our cash flows consisted of the following 

 



 

cash flows – operating activities 

 

trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income excluding noncash charges but can be affected by changes in working capital the timing of significant tax payments or refunds and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates 

 

cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased due to a decrease in operating cash flows at mgm china which were 383 million in 2015 compared to 642 million in 2014 partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows at our wholly owned domestic resorts in 2015 cash provided by operating activities at mgm china was negatively affected by changes in working capital related to short term gaming liabilities but to a lesser extent than in 2014

 

cash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased due to a decrease in operating cash flows at mgm china compared to 932 million in 2013 partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows at our wholly owned domestic resorts and lower cash paid for interest cash provided by operating activities at mgm china was negatively affected by changes in working capital related to shortterm gaming liabilities in 2014 while operating cash flows at mgm china were positively impacted by changes in working capital in 2013

 

we paid net taxes of 12 million 42 million and 1 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

 

cash flows – investing activities 

 

our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts business acquisitions or dispositions and the timing of more regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts capital expenditures related to more regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms most of such costs relate to construction materials furniture and fixtures and external labor costs

off balance sheet arrangements 

 

our offbalance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter grand victoria borgata and tmobile arena we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment other than the tmobile arena guarantee described below we have not historically guaranteed financings obtained by our investees in addition there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort

commitments and contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 

 



 









 

 



 

while we have significant indebtedness we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits cash flows from operations dividends from mgm china and availability under our senior credit facility the mgm china credit agreement and the mgm national harbor credit agreement we have 15 billion of maturities of longterm debt in 2016 see “liquidity and capital resources – other factors affecting liquidity” for further discussion of anticipated uses of cash 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates 

 

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts in addition mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our other customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau at december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 37 and 30 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 44 and 54 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the united states 

 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information 

 

in addition to enforceability issues the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

 

 

the following table shows key st atistics related to our casino receivables 

 



 

approximately 40 million and 68 million of casino receivables and 9 million and 13 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has increased in the current year due to an increase in specific reserves for highend gaming customers and an increase in the aging of accounts at december 31 2015 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 29 million

 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

 

property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the june 2011 mgm china acquisition the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses

 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

 

 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential imp airment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended us e of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale histori cally undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin 

 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method see note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets

 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an indication of impairment exists and we must proceed to measure an impairment loss if any in measuring an impairment loss the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining if any is the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value

 

due to a significant decrease in mgm china’s cash flows as well as a decline in the market capitalization of mgm china relative to its net book value we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit in the second quarter of 2015 as of the date we completed our 2015 interim goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair value of our mgm china reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 9 we therefore concluded that goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit was not impaired during the fourth quarter of 2015 we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units including our mgm china reporting unit the step one goodwill analysis of the mgm china reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4 the decrease in fair value from the interim test valuation date resulted from a further decrease in forecasted cash flows from our interim analysis based on current market conditions and a further sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the mgm china reporting unit as well as those of the mgm china reporting unit’s peer group as a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis we proceeded to perform a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss as such we determined the current fair values of all assets of the mgm china reporting unit including its separately identifiable intangible assets the current fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill therefore we recorded a 15 billion noncash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit to its implied fair value

 

with the exception of our mgm china reporting unit as discussed above none of our other reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2015 2014 or 2013 as of the date we completed our 2015 goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair values of our wholly owned domestic resorts reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge 

 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of multiples capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

 

see notes 7 and 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of write downs and impairments of goodwill and longlived assets 

 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

 

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist we 

 

 

compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain o ur investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterpri se value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group see note 6 and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of otherthantemporary impairment charges 

 

income taxes 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied as of december 31 2015 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences consequently we no longer apply a valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets other than our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and a capital loss carryforward

 

as of december 31 2015 we have a foreign tax credit carryover of 29 billion against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of 27 billion based upon our assessment of future realization the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35 of gross gaming revenue in macau because mgm china is presently exempt from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits we believe that payment of the macau special gaming tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against us taxes although mgm china’s current fiveyear exemption from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits ends on december 31 2016 we believe it will be entitled to receive a third fiveyear exemption from macau based upon exemptions granted to its competitors in order to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires for all periods beyond december 31 2021 we have assumed that mgm china will be paying the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the macau special gaming tax in such years and have factored that assumption into our assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset furthermore we do not rely on future us source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our history of recent losses in the us and therefore only rely on us federal taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10year foreign tax credit carryover period

 

our assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from mgm china our assumption concerning renewals of the five year exemption from macau’s 12 complementary tax on gaming profits and assumptions concerning future us operating profits as a result significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance for example should we in a future period actually receive or be able to assume an additional five year exemption an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material in addition a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china could also result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period 

 

finally we do not currently rely on future us source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our recent history of cumulative losses in the us and therefore only rely on us federal taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10year foreign tax credit carryover period however due to improvements in our us operations we have generated us operating profits for the past four consecutive quarters should these profits continue in future periods we may during the next 12 months begin to utilize projections of future us source operating income in our assessment of the realizability of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset which could result in a reduction in the valuation allowance and a corresponding reduction in the provision for income taxes in such period however the exact timing and amount of reduction in the valuation allowance are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve

 

in addition there is an 18 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets a valuation allowance of 3 million on a federal income tax capital loss carryforward a valuation allowance of 69 million on certain macau deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 1 million on hong kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition 

 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities

 

 

 

we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in “other accrued liabilities” or longterm in “other longterm liabilities” based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we early adopted on a prospective basis fasb accounting standards update no 201517 “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” “asu 201517” which is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 asu 201517 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets along with any related valuation allowance be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position prior to adopting asu 201517 we had a current deferred tax liability of 62 million for the period ending december 31 2014 prior periods are not retrospectively adjusted in the accompanying financial statements

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted share units “rsus” compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant we account for performance stock units “psus” measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model and monte carlo valuation model our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the blackscholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions including volatility to determine the fair value of the award changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of sharebased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year 

 

market risk 

 

in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions 

 

as of december 31 2015 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 33 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of term loan b over the 1 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 27 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2015 assuming a 100 basispoint increase in hibor for the mgm china credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 16 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2015 the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates 

 



 

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states china macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates we cannot assure 

 

 

you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the us dollar or the c urrent peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof as of december 31 2015 a 1 increase in the hong kong dollar the functional currency of mgm china to the us dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by 7 million and a 1 decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by 16 million

reportable segments

resort operations 

 

general 

 

our casino resorts offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development

 

we believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate as discussed above ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests the quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards both domestic and 

 

 

globally such as several four and five diamond designations from the american automobile association four and five star designations from mobil travel and forbes travel guide four star awards 

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a country or region can affect our results 

 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our wholly owned domestic resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we utilize thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs we lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible 

 

our operating resorts 

 

we have provided certain information below about our resorts as of december 31 2014 except as otherwise indicated we wholly own and operate the resorts shown below 

 



 



 







 

 



















 

more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 

 

wholly owned domestic resorts over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 

 

our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race and sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere 

 

mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king “ms pansy ho” completed a reorganization of the capital structure of mgm china pursuant to which we acquired an additional 1 interest in mgm china and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the transaction we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise sa “mgm grand paradise” which was accounted for under the equity method we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue 

 

our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and the development of a casino resort on the cotai strip in macau discussed further below revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau sa and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations

 

in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 18 acre site in cotai macau “mgm cotai” the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land by january 2018

 

mgm china has finalized the design of the mgm cotai project and construction commenced in 2013 in may 2013 mgm china entered into an agreement with china state construction engineering corporation to serve as the sole general contractor for the project mgm cotai will be an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort with approximately 1500 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and 1500 slots the total estimated project budget is 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs mgm cotai is anticipated to open in the fall of 2016

 

customers and competition 

 

our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally 

 

 

 

our primary methods of successful competition include 

 











 

wholly owned domestic resorts our customers include premium gaming customers leisure and wholesale travel customers business travelers and group customers including conventions trade associations and small meetings we have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and valueoriented tour and travel customers many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during midweek and offpeak periods 

 

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 150500 guestrooms in las vegas at both december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 at december 31 2014 we operated approximately 27 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 411 million in 2014 a 4 increase from the 397 million reported for 2013 

 

outside las vegas our other nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and larger operations our nevada resorts located outside of las vegas appeal primarily to the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer a significant number of our customers at these resorts come from california

 

outside nevada our resorts primarily compete for customers in local and regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas

 

mgm china the three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market are vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services gaming promoters operate vip gaming rooms within the property in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate these clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future to target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which include both table games and slots to the main floor gaming area the amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players 

 

our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally several concessionaires have expansion plans announced or underway primarily located on the cotai strip the properties currently operating in cotai have achieved a higher growth rate than those located on the macau peninsula we expect competition in the macau market to continue to increase as more capacity is brought online in the near future we also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of asia and around the world including singapore malaysia the philippines australia new zealand las vegas cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region 

 

corporate and other much like our wholly owned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts aria which we manage and own 50 through citycenter appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our wholly owned casino 

 

 

resorts and other resorts on the las vegas strip our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets

corporate social responsibility 

 

we seek to conduct our business in an effective socially responsible way while striving to maximize shareholder value our corporate social responsibility efforts are overseen by the corporate social responsibility committee of our board of directors

risk factors

tableend

 

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below

 

risks relating to our substantial indebtedness

 



 











 

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly future development projects including the las vegas arena project and our development projects in massachusetts and maryland and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 



 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2015 including 145 billion of our 425 convertible senior notes due 2015 and thereafter fluctuations in our common stock impact the likelihood of the convertible senior notes being converted into equity if our common stock price is below the conversion price of our convertible senior notes on the date of maturity holders will not convert them into equity and we will be required to repay the principal amount of the convertible securities for cash 

 

our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements

 

 

 



 















 

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt

 

in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility which contains covenants that restrict their ability to engage in certain transactions in particular the mgm china amended and restated credit facility requires mgm china to satisfy various financial covenants including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm china and its subsidiaries including mgm grand paradise which include among other things limitations on its ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets

 

risks related to our business

 



 

in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos such as has happened in california for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia including singapore australia new zealand cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and unlicensed gaming operations certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including malaysia vietnam cambodia the philippines and russia and others such as japan taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities for example the facilities currently being developed in cotai macau we would face increased competition furthermore most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and the expansion of online gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts

 

 

 

in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow

 



 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the property state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities

 

in macau current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm china’s interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm china’s activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues

 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos similarly in october 2014 casinos in macau including mgm china implemented a smoking ban which prohibits smoking on all mass market gaming floors and in 2015 the macau health bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposing a full smoking ban in casinos including in vip rooms in 2015 the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance

 

in addition we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations for instance we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970 commonly known as the bank secrecy act which among other things requires us to report to the internal revenue service irs any currency transactions in excess of 10000 that occur within a 24hour gaming day including identification of the individuals involved in the currency transaction we are also required to report certain suspicious activity including any transactions aggregating to 5000 or more where we know suspect or have reason to suspect such transactions among other things involve funds from illegal 

 

 

activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose in addition under the bank secrecy act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting recordkeeping and retention our compliance with the bank secrecy act is subject to periodic audits by the irs and we may be required to pay substantial penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulations any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the futu re or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws including the bank secrecy act or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 



 

in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china’s current restrictions on travel and currency movements including market impacts resulting from china’s recent anticorruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by nonbank lending entities and crossborder currency monitoring could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau andor the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino for example from 2008 through 2010 china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period in addition effective october 2013 china banned “zero‑fare” tour groups involving no or low upfront payments and compulsory shopping which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland china and in december 2014 the chinese government tightened the enforcement of visa transit rules for those seeking to enter macau at the gongbei border including requirements to present an airplane ticket to a destination country a visa issued by such destination country and a valid chinese passport it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau

 

furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications in addition limitations on the number of gaming tables permitted by the macau government could impact our current expectation on the number of table games we will be able to utilize at our cotai project such limitations or reduction in table game availability may impact mgm china’s results of operations finally because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai macau could be negatively impacted 

 



 

 



 



 

furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradise’s compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradise’s casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues

 



 



 

 



 

in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated with will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradise’s standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations

 

we also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans

 



 



 



 



 

 



 

while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations

 

furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers

 

even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results

 



 



 



 

for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our coinvestor are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse 

 

 

financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenter’s indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio as defined in citycenter’s third amended and restated credit facility for each quarter we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test

 

in addition in accordance with the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility we provided a cost overrun guarantee which is secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent land

 



 

any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to a number of risks including

 





























 

the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future construction projects which we might undertake for instance we currently expect the total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs we currently expect total development costs of our maryland project to be approximately 12 billion total development costs of our massachusetts project to be approximately 760 million and total development costs of our las vegas arena project to be approximately 350 million each excluding capitalized interest and land related costs while we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects including our developments in cotai maryland and massachusetts will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted in addition the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines and any such deadlines are not extended we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 



 

 

 

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 

 

we renew our insurance policies other than our builder’s risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage

 



 



 



 



 

 



 























 

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

legal proceedings

citycenter construction litigation in march 2010 perini building company inc “perini” general contractor for citycenter filed a lawsuit in the eighth judicial district court for clark county state of nevada against mgm mirage design group a wholly owned subsidiary of the company which was the original party to the perini construction agreement and certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of citycenter holdings llc the “citycenter owners” perini asserted among other things that citycenter was substantially completed but the defendants failed to pay perini approximately 490 million allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor equipment and materials expended on citycenter 

 

in april 2010 perini served an amended complaint in this case which joined as defendants many owners of citycenter residential condominium units the “condo owner defendants” added a count for foreclosure of perinis recorded master mechanic’s lien against the citycenter property in the amount of approximately 491 million and asserted the priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the citycenter owners the condo owner defendants and citycenter lenders in the citycenter property in november 2012 perini filed a second amended complaint which among other things added claims against the citycenter defendants of breach of contract alleging that citycenter’s owner controlled insurance program “ocip” failed to provide adequate project insurance for perini with broad coverages and high limits and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing alleging improper administration by citycenter of the ocip and builders risk insurance programs prior to the final settlement as defined below citycenter settled the claims of 219 firsttier perini subcontractors including the claims of any lowertier 

 

 

subcontractors that might have claims through those firsttier subcontractors as a result of these settlement agreements and the prior settlement agreements between perini and citycenter most but not all of the components of perini’s nonharmonrelated lien claim against citycenter were resolved on february 24 2014 perini filed a revised lien for 174 million as the amount claimed by perini and the remaining harmonrelated subcontractors

 

during 2013 citycenter reached a settlement agreement with certain professional service providers against whom it had asserted claims in this litigation for errors or omissions with respect to the citycenter project and relevant insurers this settlement was approved by the court and citycenter received proceeds of 38 million in 2014 related to both the harmon and other components of the citycenter project

 

in 2014 citycenter reached a settlement with builder’s risk insurers of a claim relating to damage alleged at the harmon and received proceeds of 55 million

 

in december 2014 the perini matter was concluded through a global settlement among the company citycenter perini the remaining subcontractors including those implicated in the harmon work and their affiliates and relevant insurers which followed the previously disclosed settlement agreements and an extrajudicial program for settlement of certain project subcontractor claims this global settlement concluded all outstanding claims in the case the “final settlement” the effectiveness of the global settlement was made contingent upon citycenter’s execution of certain indemnity and release agreements which were executed in january 2015 and citycenter’s procurement of replacement general liability insurance covering construction of the citycenter development which was obtained in january 2015

 

the final settlement together with previous settlement agreements relating to the nonharmon related lien claims resolved all of perini’s and the remaining subcontractors’ lien claims against citycenter mgm resorts international design formerly known as mgm mirage design group certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of citycenter and the condo owner defendants however citycenter expressly reserved any claims for latent or hidden defects as to any portion of citycenter’s original construction other than the harmon not known to citycenter at the time of the agreement the company and citycenter entered into the final settlement solely as a compromise and settlement and not in any way as an admission of liability or fault 

 

the key terms of the final settlement included 

 

with respect to its nonharmon lien claims perini waived a specific portion of its lien claim against citycenter which combined with the prior nonharmon agreement and accrued interest resulted in a total citycenter payment to perini of 153 million approximately 14 million of which was paid in december 2014 the total payment to perini was funded by the company under the company’s completion guarantee and included the application of approximately 58 million of condominium proceeds that were previously held in escrow by citycenter to fund construction lien claims upon final resolution of the perini litigation

 

citycenter’s recovery for its harmon construction defect claims when added to the harmonrelated proceeds from prior insurance settlements of 85 million resulted in gross cash settlement proceeds to citycenter of approximately 191 million of which approximately 18 million was paid by the company under the completion guarantee in february 2015

 

in conjunction with the final settlement the company and an insurer participating in the ocip resolved their arbitration dispute concerning such insurer’s claim for payments it made under the ocip general liability coverage for contractor costs incurred in the harmon litigation premium adjustments and certain other costs and expenses the company settled this dispute for 38 million and funded the majority of such amounts under the completion guarantee in january 2015 in addition the settlement requires future payments equivalent to fifty percent of any additional contractor costs paid by such insurer after november 30 2014 in connection with the harmon litigation and claims handling fees which the company does not expect to be significant this agreement also provided for specified reductions in the letters of credit the company posted as collateral to secure the payment of its obligations under the disputed coverage agreements

securities and derivative litigation   adolf stumpf and rosemarie stumpf as trustees for the christine stumpf trust v mgm resorts international et al case no 10262 filed october 21 2014 court of chancery of the state of delaware and pontiac general employees retirement system v robert h baldwin et al case no 10290 filed october 28 2014 court of chancery of the state of delaware the stumpf action names as defendants the company members of its board of directors and bank of america corporation “bank of america” the pontiac general action names members of the company’s board of directors and bank of america as defendants plaintiffs in both actions allege that they are company stockholders and that they are each acting on behalf of a class including all other company stockholders in the alternative plaintiff in the pontiac general action alleges that it claims 

 

 

derivatively on behalf of the company plaintiffs in both actions allege that the company’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by unjustifiably approving the company’s amended and restated credit agreement dated as of december 20 2012 the “credit agreement” or “agreement” which contains what plaintiffs call a “dead hand proxy put” change of control provision plaintiffs in both actions assert that this provision permits bank of america as administrative agent under the credit agreement to declare a default and accelerate payment of all outstanding debt and interest thereunder in the event of a change of control ie replacement of a majority of the directors by an actual or threatened proxy fight or consent solicitation under circumstances specified in the agreement plaintiffs in both actions claim that this provision has a coercive effect on stockholder voting for change on the board of directors and entrenches the company’s incumbent directors both complaints further allege that bank of america aided and abetted the defendant directors in their alleged breach of fiduciary duties the pontiac general complaint seeks a declaration that demands the board of directors to invalidate the challenged change of control provision would be futile both complaints seek a declaratory judgment that the company’s directors breached their fiduciary duties that bank of america aided and abetted this breach and that the challenged change of control provision is invalid unenforceable and severable a permanent injunction against enforcement of the challenged provision by bank of america and attorneys’ fees and other costs 

 

both of these actions were consolidated under the caption in re mgm resorts international litigation case no 10290 plaintiffs designated the complaint in the pontiac general action as their operative complaint and agreed to a voluntary dismissal of three directors named in the stumpf complaint but not the pontiac general complaint – mary chris gay william w grounds and gregory m spierkel plaintiffs and defendants agreed to extend deadlines for answers and objections and responses to plaintiffs’ document requests until april 7 2015 to allow the company and bank of america to pursue amendment of the credit agreement in the second quarter of 2015 in a manner that will moot the action plaintiffs informed the company’s counsel that in the event their claims are mooted plaintiffs will seek an award of attorneys’ fees

 

in 2009 various shareholders filed six lawsuits in nevada federal and state court against the company and various of its former and current directors and officers alleging federal securities laws violations andor related breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with statements allegedly made by the defendants during the period august 2007 through the date of such lawsuit filings in 2009 the “class period” in general the lawsuits assert the same or similar allegations including that during the relevant period defendants artificially inflated the company’s common stock price by knowingly making materially false and misleading statements and omissions to the investing public about the company’s financial statements and condition operations citycenter and the intrinsic value of the company’s common stock that these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby enabled certain company insiders to derive personal profit from the sale of company common stock to the public that defendants caused plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase company common stock at artificially inflated prices and that defendants imprudently implemented a share repurchase program to the detriment of the company the lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory damages restitution and disgorgement of alleged profits andor attorneys’ fees and costs in amounts to be proven at trial as well as injunctive relief related to corporate governance only two of these lawsuits remain pending

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

executive overview 

 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe that we own and invest in several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities

 

results of operations from our wholly owned domestic resorts for the year ended december 31 2014 improved compared to the prior year as a result of increased casino and noncasino revenues as general economic conditions continued to improve in the las vegas strip market as reported by the las vegas convention and visitors authority the average room rate for the las vegas strip increased 5 in 2014 compared to 2013 while visitation to las vegas increased 4 

 

in macau gross gaming revenues decreased 3 in 2014 compared to 2013 negatively affected by economic conditions and certain political initiatives in china stricter enforcement of entrance into macau via the use of transit visas as well as a decrease in duration of stay permitted for transit visa holders and the implementation of a full main floor casino smoking ban in october 2014 the decrease in gross gaming revenues accelerated during the second half of 2014 as macau has become an increasingly challenging and competitive market and has impacted primarily vip casino gaming operations however despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in china we expect the macau market to continue to grow on a longterm basis as the result of a large and growing asian middle class and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government visitor arrivals were 32 million in 2014 an 8 increase compared to 2013

 

our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities in macau we plan to spend approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs to develop a resort and casino featuring approximately 1500 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and 1500 slots built on an approximately 18 acre site in cotai macau “mgm cotai” mgm cotai is anticipated to open in the fall of 2016 

 

we were awarded the sixth and final casino license under current statutes in the state of maryland by the maryland video lottery facility location commission to build and operate mgm national harbor a destination resort casino in prince george’s county at national harbor we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm national harbor to be approximately 12 billion excluding capitalized interest and land related costs we expect that the resort will include a casino with approximately 3600 slots and 160 table games including poker a 300 suite hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool 79000 square feet of high end branded retail and fine and casual dining a dedicated 3000 seat theater venue 50000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 4700 space parking garage construction of mgm national harbor has commenced with estimated completion in the second half of 2016

 

we were awarded the category one casino license in region b western massachusetts one of three licensing regions designated by legislation to build and operate mgm springfield mgm springfield will be developed on approximately 145 acres of land between union and state streets and columbus avenue and main street in springfield massachusetts we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm springfield to be approximately 760 million excluding capitalized interest and land related costs we expect the resort will include a casino with approximately 3000 slots and 100 table games including poker 250 hotel rooms 64000 square feet of retail and restaurant space 33000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 3500 space parking garage construction of mgm springfield is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017

 

we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of anschutz entertainment group inc “aeg” a leader in sports entertainment and promotions to design construct and operate the las vegas arena which will be located on a parcel of our land between frank sinatra drive and new yorknew york adjacent to the las vegas strip we and aeg each own 50 of las vegas arena company the developer of the arena the las vegas arena is anticipated to seat between 18000 – 20000 people and is currently scheduled to be completed in the first half of 2016 such development is estimated to cost approximately 350 million excluding capitalized interest and land related costs in september 2014 a wholly owned subsidiary of las vegas arena company entered into a 200 million senior secured credit facility to finance construction of the las vegas arena

 

 

 

reportable segments 

 

we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 15 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm china’s operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino “mgm macau” and the development of a casino resort in cotai we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hakkasan hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results 

 

wholly owned domestic resorts at december 31 2014 our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts 

 



 

over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally 

 

key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are 

 



 



 

mgm china we own 51 and have a controlling interest in mgm china which owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns the mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions and is in the process of developing mgm cotai we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability 

 

revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenuesharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walkin and day trip visitors unlike gaming promoters and inhouse vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds 

 

 

the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future

 

vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the nonnegotiable chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are based on either a percentage of actual win plus a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the rolling chip turnover their customers generate or a percentage of the rolling chip turnover plus discounted offerings on nongaming amenities the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue 

 

main floor table games wagers at mgm macau are conducted by the use of cash chips in addition to purchasing cash chips at gaming tables main floor customers may also purchase cash chips at the casino cage as a result of recent significant increases in cash chips purchased at the casino cage we now adjust main floor table games drop to include such purchases in order to more meaningfully reflect main floor table games volume and hold percentage mgm macau’s main floor normal table games hold percentage as calculated on this basis is in the range of 20 to 28 of table games drop slots hold percentage at mgm macau is in the range of 43 to 53 of slots handle

 

in addition to the key performance indicators used by our wholly owned domestic resorts mgm macau utilizes “turnover” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is in the range of 27 to 30 of turnover 

 

corporate and other corporate and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations   see note 1 and note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company’s unconsolidated affiliates including citycenter and borgata

nonoperating results 

 

interest expense  the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt 

 



 

in 2014 gross interest costs decreased compared to 2013 as a result of a decrease in weighted average longterm debt outstanding during the year primarily relating to borrowings under our revolving credit facility in 2013 gross interest costs decreased compared to 2012 as a result of the december 2012 refinancing transactions amortization of debt discounts premiums and issuance costs included in interest expense in 2014 2013 and 2012 was 38 million 35 million and 73 million respectively 

 

nonoperating items from unconsolidated affiliates nonoperating items from unconsolidated affiliates decreased 121 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a decrease in interest expense at citycenter as a result of the october 2013 debt restructuring transactions discussed below lower statutory interest recorded by citycenter related to estimated amounts owed in connection with the citycenter construction litigation and the net impact of other nonoperating items from unconsolidated affiliates recognized in 2013 as discussed below

income taxes the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 



 

our effective tax rate increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset in 2014 and the realization of deferred tax assets in 2013 that were previously offset by a valuation allowance and a tax expense recognized in 2013 as a result of remeasuring net deferred tax liabilities in macau the effective tax rate increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to tax expense resulting from remeasuring the macau net deferred tax liability due to the extension of the amortization period of the mgm china gaming subconcession upon effectiveness of the cotai land concession offset in part by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation the 

 

 

income tax benefit on pretax loss in 2012 was substantially below the 35 statutory rate due primarily to the fact that we began recording a valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets during the year 

 

cash taxes paid increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of 30 million paid to irs for the closure of examinations covering the 2005 through 2009 tax years and 8 million estimated taxes paid to the irs during 2014 the remaining 4 million of cash taxes paid in 2014 consist of state and foreign income taxes cash taxes paid in 2013 and 2012 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes 

 

nongaap measures 

 

“adjusted ebitda” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses and property transactions net “adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts stock option plan which is not allocated to each property mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies

 

we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of wholly owned domestic resorts operating performance 

 

adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda in a different manner

trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income excluding noncash charges but can be affected by changes in working capital the timing of significant tax payments or refunds and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in both 2014 and 2013 operating cash flow also benefited from a decrease in interest paid we paid net taxes of 42 million 1 million and 7 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively also in the years presented cash provided by operating activities has been significantly impacted by changes in working capital at mgm china operating income at mgm china has increased in both 2014 and 2013 however in 2014 cash provided by operating activities of 642 million at mgm china was negatively affected by changes in working capital related to short term gaming liabilities while in 2013 cash provided by operating activities of 932 million was positively affected by changes in working capital primarily related to short term gaming liabilities operating cash flow at mgm china was 751 million in 2012

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts in addition mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau at december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 30 and 31 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 54 and 57 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the united states 

 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information 

 

in addition to enforceability issues the collectibility of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables 

 



 

approximately 68 million and 78 million of casino receivables and 13 million and 4 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has increased in the current year due to an increase in the aging of accounts at december 31 2014 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 3 million 

 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

 

property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the june 2011 mgm china acquisition the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

 

 

 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses see note 4 in the accompanying financial statements for discussion regarding our assets held for sale

 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin 

 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2014 2013 or 2012 as of the date we completed our 2014 goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair values of our reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge 

 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

 

see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of write downs and impairments of longlived assets 

 

 

 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

 

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group see note 6 and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of otherthantemporary impairment charges 

 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied as of december 31 2014 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences consequently we no longer apply a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets other than our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset

as of december 31 2014 we have a foreign tax credit carryover of 26 billion and we have recorded a valuation allowance of 25 billion against this deferred tax asset based upon our assessment of future realization the foreign tax credits are attributable to the macau special gaming tax which is 35 of gross gaming revenue in macau because mgm china is presently exempt from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits we believe that payment of the macau special gaming tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against us taxes as long as the exemption from macau’s 12 complementary tax on gaming profits continues we expect that we will generate excess foreign tax credits on an annual basis and that none of the excess foreign credits will be utilized until the exemption expires although mgm china’s current fiveyear exemption from the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits ends on december 31 2016 we believe it will be entitled to receive a third fiveyear exemption from macau based upon exemptions granted to its competitors in order to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires for all periods beyond december 31 2021 we have assumed that mgm china will be paying the macau 12 complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the macau special gaming tax in such years and have factored that assumption into our assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset furthermore we do not rely on future us source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our history of recent losses in the us and therefore only rely on us federal taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10year foreign tax credit carryover period

our assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from mgm china as well as our assumption concerning renewals of the five year exemption from macau’s 12 complementary tax on gaming profits as a result significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance for example should we in a future period actually receive or be able to assume an additional five year exemption an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material in addition a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from mgm china could also result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period 

in addition there is a 15 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 60 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because we believe these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities

we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in “other accrued liabilities” or longterm in “other longterm liabilities” 

 

 

based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted share units “rsus” compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant we account for performance stock units “psus” measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model and monte carlo valuation model our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the blackscholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions including volatility to determine the fair value of the award changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of sharebased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year 

 

market risk 

 

in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions 

 

as of december 31 2014 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 23 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of term loan b over the 1 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 27 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2014 assuming a 100 basispoint increase in hibor for the mgm grand paradise credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 6 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2014 the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates 

 



 

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates as of december 31 2014 a 1 increase in the hong kong dollar the functional currency of mgm china to the us dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by 5 million and a 1 decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by 6 million

    reportable segments 

we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 15 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm china’s operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino “mgm macau” and the development of a gaming resort in cotai macau we have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations the citycenter joint venture “citycenter” is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee see “resort operations” below as well as note 17 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our segments 

resort operations 

general 

our casino resorts offer gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities 

 

we believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate as discussed above ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests the quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards both domestic and globally such as several four and five diamond designations from the american automobile association four and five star designations from mobil travel and forbes travel guide four star awards 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend gaming customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year while our results do not depend on key individual customers a significant portion of our operating income is generated from highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results in addition our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a country or region can affect our results 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our wholly owned domestic resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we utilize thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs we lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible 

our operating resorts 

we have provided certain information below about our resorts as of december 31 2013 except as otherwise indicated we wholly own and operate the resorts shown below 

 

  

  

        more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 

wholly owned domestic resorts over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 

our casino operations feature a variety of slots table games and race and sports book wagering in addition we offer our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere 

mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king “ms pansy ho” completed a reorganization of the capital structure of mgm china pursuant to which we acquired an additional 1 interest in mgm china and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the transaction we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise sa “mgm grand paradise” which was accounted for under the equity method we believe our ownership interest in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and has continued to grow over the past few years despite the global economic downturn 

our current mgm china operations relate to mgm macau and the development of a casino resort on the cotai strip in macau discussed further below revenues at mgm macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by mgm grand paradise the macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession was granted by sociedade de jogos de macau 

 

sa and expires in 2020 the macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations 

in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau “mgm cotai” the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land by january 2018 also in october 2012 mgm china and mgm grand paradise as coborrowers successfully closed on a 20 billion amended and restated credit facility agreement which we believe ensures the necessary funding for the mgm cotai project 

mgm china has finalized the design of the mgm cotai project and construction of the foundation commenced in 2013 in may 2013 mgm china entered into an agreement with china state construction engineering corporation to serve as the sole general contractor for the project mgm cotai will be an integrated casino hotel and entertainment resort with approximately 1600 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and up to 2500 slots the total estimated project budget is 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs 

customers and competition 

our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments we compete against gaming companies as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in neighboring markets and in other parts of the world including nongaming resort destinations such as hawaii our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states and internationally 

our primary methods of successful competition include 

 

     wholly owned domestic resorts our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 151000 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2013 and 2012 at december 31 2013 we operated approximately 27 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 397 million in both 2013 and 2012 

the las vegas market includes leisure travel customers premium gaming customers convention customers including small meetings trade associations and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel customers our luxury wholly owned resorts including bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome customers largely from the leisure travel and the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments 

 

outside of las vegas our other nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and larger operations our nevada resorts located outside of las vegas appeal primarily to the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer a significant number of our customers at these resorts come from california 

outside of nevada our resorts primarily compete for customers in local and regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas 

mgm china our key competitors in macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires if the macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally several concessionaires have expansion plans announced or underway primarily located on the cotai strip the properties currently operating in cotai have achieved a higher growth rate than those located on the macau peninsula we expect competition in the macau market to continue to increase as more capacity is brought online in the near future we also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of asia and around the world including singapore malaysia the philippines australia new zealand las vegas cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region 

the three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market are vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations 

vip gaming play is sourced both internally and externally externally sourced vip gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer vip players various services such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel food and beverage services gaming promoters operate vip gaming rooms within the property in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of commission we extend credit and provide complimentaries to our internally sourced vip clientele without the use of an intermediary these clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts 

the main floor gaming operation in macau is also referred to as the “mass gaming operation” unlike vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future to target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadiumstyle electronic table games terminals which includes both table games and slots to the main floor gaming area the amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players 

corporate and other much like our wholly owned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts aria which we manage and own 50 through the citycenter joint venture appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our wholly owned luxury casino resorts and other luxury resorts on the las vegas strip our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets 

marketing 

our marketing efforts are conducted through various means including our loyalty programs as discussed further below we advertise on radio television internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in 

 

selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as by direct mail email and through the use of social media we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major us and foreign cities a key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention segment we maintain websites to inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets we actively utilize several social media sites to promote our brands unique events and special deals

corporate social responsibility 

we seek to conduct our business in an effective socially responsible way while striving to maximize shareholder value our corporate social responsibility efforts are overseen by the corporate social responsibility committee of our board of directors 

environmental sustainability we continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive environmental responsibility initiatives our resorts in nevada and michigan were the first to earn certification from green key the largest international program evaluating sustainable hotel operations we received certifications at 12 resorts including “five green key” the highest possible ratings at aria vdara and mandalay bay many major travel service providers recognize the green key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations

internal controls 

we have a strong culture of compliance driven by our history in the highly regulated gaming industry and our belief that compliance is a valueadded activity our system of internal controls and procedures – including internal control over financial reporting – is designed to promote reliable and accurate financial records transparent disclosures compliance with laws and regulations and protection of our assets our internal controls start at the source of business transactions and we have rigorous enforcement at both the business unit and corporate level 

we have a corporate internal audit function that performs regular reviews regarding gaming compliance internal controls over financial reporting and operations in addition we maintain an independent compliance committee that administers our companywide compliance plan the compliance plan is in place to promote compliance with gaming and other laws applicable to our operations in all jurisdictions including performing background investigations on our current and potential employees directors and vendors as well as thorough review of proposed transactions and associations mgm china also has its own internal audit group with similar responsibilities and has established a compliance program at mgm macau that is modeled after our program

in connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements and other activities including cash transaction reporting which is essential in our industry marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our highend resorts we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to timely pay their marker balances these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices direct personal contact and the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation 

development and leveraging our brand and management assets 

in allocating resources our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts spending on new resorts or initiatives and repaying longterm debt we believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns although these decisions were significantly affected by economic conditions over the past several years when our access to capital was limited 

we regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in nevada or in states other than nevada or outside of the united states we leverage our management expertise and wellrecognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities we feel that several of our brands particularly the “mgm grand” “bellagio” and “skylofts” brands are well suited to new projects in both gaming and nongaming developments we may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties 

mgm hospitality 

mgm hospitality seeks to leverage our management expertise and wellrecognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities mgm hospitality has entered into management agreements for nongaming hotels in the middle east north africa india and through its joint venture with diaoyutai state guesthouse the people’s republic of china mgm hospitality opened its first resort mgm grand sanya on hainan island the people’s republic of china in 2012 

domestic regional developments 

in december 2013 our subsidiary mgm national harbor llc “mgm national harbor” was awarded the license to operate the sixth and final casino under current statutes in the state of maryland by the maryland video lottery facility location commission to build and operate a worldclass destination resort casino in prince george’s county at national harbor we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm 

 

national harbor to be approximately 10 billion excluding capitalized interest and land related costs we expect that the resort will include a casino with approximately 3600 slots 160 table games including poker a 300suite hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool highend branded retail fine and casual dining a dedicated 3000 seat theater venue 35000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 5000space parking structure 

we are the only remaining applicant for the casino license in western massachusetts one of three zones designated by legislation in december 2013 a unanimous vote from the massachusetts gaming commission “mgc” found us a suitable candidate for a casino license in the commonwealth we have since submitted to the mgc a completed license application for the next phase of the licensing process however there can be no assurance that the mgc will ultimately award us the license mgm springfield is proposed for 145 acres of land in downtown springfield we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm springfield to be approximately 690 million excluding capitalized interest and land related costs 

las vegas arena 

in 2013 we formed a 5050 joint venture las vegas arena company llc “lva” with a subsidiary of anschutz entertainment group inc a leader in sports entertainment and promotions to design construct and operate an arena on a parcel of our land located between frank sinatra drive and new yorknew york adjacent to the las vegas strip the proposed arena is anticipated to seat between 18000 – 20000 people and is currently scheduled to be completed in 2016 such development is estimated to cost approximately 350 million and is contingent on lva obtaining permanent financing 

other 

in october 2011 we announced a strategic partnership with bwinparty digital entertainment plc the world’s largest publicly traded online poker operator with operations under the “partypoker” brand although interstate online gambling is currently prohibited in the united states this partnership gives us the ability to offer a secure and regulated online gaming platform to us customers subject to the limitations of applicable federal and state laws and regulations

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below 

risks relating to our substantial indebtedness 

 

  

     moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly future development projects and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

  

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2015 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace such indebtedness will depend upon the foregoing as well as on continued and sustained improvements in financial markets if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements 

 

  

       our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and could force us to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws 

in addition mgm grand paradise and mgm china are coborrowers under an amended and restated credit facility which contains covenants that restrict their ability to engage in certain transactions in particular the mgm china amended and restated credit facility requires mgm china to satisfy various financial covenants including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm china and its subsidiaries including mgm grand paradise which include among other things limitations on its ability to pay dividends or distributions to us incur additional debt make investments or engage in other businesses merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell assets 

risks related to our business 

 

  

 in addition competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos such as has happened in california for example while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia including singapore australia new zealand cruise ships in asia that offer gaming and unlicensed gaming operations certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming including malaysia vietnam cambodia and the philippines and others such as japan taiwan and thailand may legalize casino gaming or online gaming in the future furthermore currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaries open additional facilities for example the facilities currently being developed in cotai macau we would face increased competition furthermore most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical andor geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise furthermore certain jurisdictions including nevada and new jersey have also legalized forms of online gaming and the expansion of online gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts 

in addition to competition with other hotels resorts and casinos we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 further our directors officers key employees and joint venture partners must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or joint venture partner unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint venture partner may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in the joint venture state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or joint venture partners to ensure compliance with applicable standards for example as a result of the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the “dge” 

 

investigation of our relationship with our joint venture partner in macau we entered into a settlement agreement with the dge under which we were required to place in trust and sell our 50 ownership interest in borgata and related leased land in atlantic city on august 8 2011 the new jersey casino control commission approved an amendment to the settlement agreement extending the time within which the sale of the trust property was required to occur by 18 months so that until march 24 2013 we had the right to direct the trustee to sell the trust property the “divestiture period” but if the sale was not concluded by that date the trustee would have been authorized to sell such interests within the following 12 months the “terminal sale period” on february 13 2013 the settlement agreement was further amended to allow us to reapply to the ccc for licensure in new jersey and to defer expiration of these periods pending the outcome of the licensure process if the ccc denies our licensure request then the divestiture period will immediately end and the terminal sale period will immediately begin which will result in our borgata interest being disposed of by the trustee pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities 

in macau current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are for the most part fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations these laws and regulations are complex and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations or issue new or modified regulations that differ from mgm china’s interpretation which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition mgm china’s activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies we cannot assure you that mgm china will be able to obtain all necessary approvals and any such failure to do so may materially affect its longterm business strategy and operations macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions however to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising for instance we are subject to certain federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of 1990 under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos and in january 2013 casinos in macau including mgm china implemented a smoking ban in which a portion of casino floors are to be designated nonsmoking the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance 

in addition we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various antimoney laundering laws and regulations such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted any violations of the antimoney laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

 in addition since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau from mainland china general economic and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china’s current restrictions on travel and currency movements could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to mgm macau as well as the amounts they are willing to spend in the casino for example from 2008 through 2010 china readjusted its visa policy toward macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland chinese citizens may make to macau in a given time period in addition effective october 2013 china banned “zerofare” tour groups involving no or low upfront payments and compulsory shopping which were popular among visitors to macau from mainland china it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect become more restrictive or be readopted in the future these developments have had and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau 

furthermore our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and the adequacy of transportation infrastructure in macau to accommodate the demand from future development our success in macau will be impacted by our ability to retain and hire employees we compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of new developments in macau while we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications in addition because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau the desirability of macau as a gaming destination as well as the results of operations at our development in cotai macau could be negatively impacted 

 

  

  

 furthermore under the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of or mgm grand paradise’s compliance with a provision of the subconcession contract mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government during any consultation or negotiation mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the macau government currently there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above the loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the subconcession contract expires on march 31 2020 unless the subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended all of mgm grand paradise’s casino premises and gamingrelated equipment will automatically be transferred to the macau government on that date without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations beginning on april 20 2017 the macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right mgm grand paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and nongaming revenue generated by mgm grand paradise excluding the convention and exhibition facilities during the taxable year prior to the redemption before deducting interest depreciation and amortization multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all we also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues 

 

  

  

 in addition the quality of gaming promoters is important to mgm grand paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses while mgm grand paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom mgm grand paradise is or becomes associated with will meet the high standards insisted upon if a gaming promoter falls below mgm grand paradise’s standards mgm grand paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations 

we also grant credit lines to our gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans 

 

  

  

 while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the united states of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations 

furthermore we expect that mgm macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions including macau to the extent mgm macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions mgm macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because among other reasons courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts moreover under applicable law mgm macau remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers 

even where gaming debts are enforceable they may not be collectible our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results 

 

  

  

  

 for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our partners are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing citycenter’s indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require citycenter to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio as defined in citycenter’s third amended and restated credit facility for each quarter commencing on march 31 2014 we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test 

in addition in accordance with our joint venture agreement and the citycenter third amended and restated credit facility we provided a cost overrun guarantee which is secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land 

 

 any of our future construction or development projects will be subject to a number of risks including 

 

             

  the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs delay or prevent the construction development or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future construction projects which we might undertake for instance we expect the total development costs of our cotai project to be approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs we expect total development costs of our maryland project to be approximately 10 billion and our massachusetts project to be approximately 690 million each excluding capitalized interest and land related costs while we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected we cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects including our developments in cotai and maryland and in massachusetts if we are awarded the license will not increase beyond amounts initially budgeted 

 

 in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 

we renew our insurance policies other than our builder’s risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits further increase our deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage 

 

  

  

  

  

  

         

   these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions maintain information and manage our businesses disruptions in the availability of our computer systems through cyberattacks or otherwise could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations 

 

  

    we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such investments or alliances

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend citycenter construction litigation in march 2010 perini building company inc “perini” general contractor for citycenter filed a lawsuit in the eighth judicial district court for clark county state of nevada against mgm mirage design group a wholly owned subsidiary of the company which was the original party to the perini construction agreement and certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of citycenter holdings llc the “citycenter owners” perini asserted that citycenter was substantially completed but the defendants failed to pay perini approximately 490 million allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor equipment and materials expended on citycenter the complaint further charged the defendants with failure to provide timely and complete design documents late delivery to perini of design changes mismanagement of the change order process obstruction of perini’s ability to complete the harmon component and fraudulent inducement of perini to compromise significant amounts due for its general conditions the complaint advanced claims for breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel and fraud and intentional misrepresentation perini seeks compensatory damages punitive damages attorneys’ fees and costs 

in april 2010 perini served an amended complaint in this case which joins as defendants many owners of citycenter residential condominium units the “condo owner defendants” added a count for foreclosure of perinis recorded master mechanic’s lien against the citycenter property in the amount of approximately 491 million and asserted the priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the citycenter owners the condo owner defendants and citycenter lenders in the citycenter property 

the citycenter owners and the other defendants dispute perini’s allegations and contend that the defendants are entitled to substantial amounts from perini including offsets against amounts claimed to be owed to perini and its subcontractors and damages based on breach of their contractual and other duties to citycenter duplicative payment requests nonconforming work lack of proof of alleged work performance defective work related to the harmon property damage and perini’s failure to perform its obligations to pay certain subcontractors and to prevent filing of liens against citycenter parallel to the court litigation citycenter management conducted an extrajudicial program for settlement of citycenter subcontractor claims citycenter has resolved the claims of 219 firsttier perini subcontractors including the claims of any lowertier subcontractors that might have claims through those firsttier subcontractors with only three remaining for further proceedings along with trial of perini’s claims and citycenter’s harmonrelated counterclaim and other claims by citycenter against perini and its parent guarantor tutor perini two of the remaining subcontractors are implicated in the defective work at the harmon in august 2013 perini recorded an amended notice of lien reducing its lien to approximately 167 million 

in november 2012 perini filed a second amended complaint which among other things added claims against the citycenter defendants of breach of contract alleging that citycenter’s owner controlled insurance program “ocip” failed to provide adequate project insurance for perini with broad coverages and high limits and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing alleging improper administration by citycenter of the ocip and builders risk insurance programs 

citycenter reached a settlement agreement with certain professional service providers against whom it had asserted claims in this litigation for errors or omissions with respect to the citycenter project which settlement has been approved by the court further citycenter and perini have entered a settlement agreement which resolves most but not all of the components of perini’s nonharmonrelated lien claim against citycenter pursuant to the parties’ stipulation on february 24 2014 perini filed a revised lien for 174 million as the amount claimed by perini and the remaining harmonrelated subcontractors trial of the remainder of perini’s lien claim the remaining subcontractors’ claims against citycenter and citycenter’s counterclaims against perini and certain subcontractors for defective work at the harmon has been rescheduled to commence on september 23 2014 

 

the citycenter owners and the other defendants will continue to vigorously assert and protect their interests in the perini lawsuit the company believes that a loss with respect to perini’s punitive damages claim is neither probable nor reasonably possible 

please refer to note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company’s completion guarantee obligation which may be impacted by the outcome of the above litigation and the joint venture’s extrajudicial settlement process 

securities and derivative litigation in 2009 various shareholders filed six lawsuits in nevada federal and state court against the company and various of its former and current directors and officers alleging federal securities laws violations andor related breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with statements allegedly made by the defendants during the period august 2007 through the date of such lawsuit filings in 2009 the “class period” in general the lawsuits assert the same or similar allegations including that during the relevant period defendants artificially inflated the company’s common stock price by knowingly making materially false and misleading statements and omissions to the investing public about the company’s financial statements and condition operations citycenter and the intrinsic value of the company’s common stock that these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby enabled certain company insiders to derive personal profit from the sale of company common stock to the public that defendants caused plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase company common stock at artificially inflated prices and that defendants imprudently implemented a share repurchase program to the detriment of the company the lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory damages restitution and disgorgement of alleged profits andor attorneys’ fees and costs in amounts to be proven at trial as well as injunctive relief related to corporate governance

in march 2011 all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on the grounds that it fails to allege facts upon which relief could be granted under the federal securities laws and on the further ground that the complaint fails to satisfy the heightened pleading standards mandated by the private securities litigation reform act “pslra” the motions to dismiss emphasized three primary arguments 1 the complaint fails to allege that the defendants made false or misleading statements of fact as opposed to statements concerning plans and expectations that did not anticipate the severity of the financial crisis of 20082009 and the challenges presented by constructing citycenter 2 the complaint fails to allege facts supporting a “strong inference” of wrongful intent as the pslra requires and 3 the complaint fails to plead adequately that the alleged wrongdoing was the cause of the decline in the price of the company’s publicly traded securities the parties completed the briefing in support of and in opposition to the motions to dismiss and requested oral argument on the motions 

 

in march 2012 the court issued an order which granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ consolidated complaint without prejudice and allowed plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint on april 17 2012 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which substantially repeats but reorganizes their substantive allegations and asserts the same claims as raised in the original complaint in may 2012 defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint in september 2013 the court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint defendants have answered the amended complaint the court has entered a scheduling order and discovery has commenced

in december 2010 and january 2011 the company and its directors filed motions with the court to dismiss the derivative complaints in the israni and kim cases the defendant company officers also filed a separate motion to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to allege either that a presuit demand had been made on the company’s board of directors and had been wrongfully rejected or that making such a demand would have been futile because the case falls within the extremely rare circumstance where the board would have been legally incapable of exercising its business judgment on the litigation decision in march 2011 after the filing of these dismissal motions and pursuant to the parties’ stipulation the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint that asserted claims similar to those in their earlier complaints in april 2011 the defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on the same grounds as their original motions to dismiss after hearing on the motions to dismiss in june 2010 the court in july 2010 granted the motions on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to allege facts excusing them from making a presuit demand on the company’s board of directors the court directed that the defendants submit a proposed order setting forth the factual and legal bases the defendants submitted a proposed order and the plaintiffs submitted an objection to the proposed order 

in may 2012 the court in the israni and kim cases entered an order that granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend and an order that dismissed plaintiffs’ consolidated amended complaint with prejudice in june 2012 the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the district court ruling to the nevada supreme court on december 30 2013 the nevada supreme court affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of these cases on the bases that plaintiffs failed to make a prelitigation demand upon the company’s board of directors and to demonstrate a reasonable doubt as to whether a majority of the company’s directors could exercise independent judgment and reasoning when considering a presuit demand

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive overview 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel convention dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities we believe that we own and invest in several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage most of our revenue is cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financings fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash flow for future development we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings as well as other new features and amenities 

results of operations from our wholly owned domestic resorts for the year ended december 31 2013 improved compared to the prior year as a result of increased casino and hotel revenues as general economic conditions continue to improve in the las vegas strip market as reported by the las vegas convention and visitors authority casino revenues increased 48 in addition the average room rate for the las vegas strip increased 28 compared to the same period in the prior year while visitation to las vegas was flat for the same period 

in macau results of operations also improved for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of strong gaming volumes benefiting from economic growth in china despite concerns about the sustainability of economic growth in china we expect the macau market to continue to grow as the result of a large and growing asian middle class and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau according to statistics published by the statistics census service of the macau government visitor arrivals were 29 million in 2013 a 4 increase compared to 2012 gross casino revenues for the macau market increased 19 compared to the prior year with increases in both vip and main floor volumes 

our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital in december 2012 we completed a comprehensive refinancing transaction that generated a significant reduction in interest expense for 2013 and extended the maturities of our longterm debt allowing us to maximize free cash flow and further enhance our deleveraging efforts in addition our access to lower cost financing and ability to finance development opportunities has also improved significantly as a result of these transactions 

while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities in macau we plan to spend approximately 29 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation capitalized interest and land related costs to develop a resort and casino featuring approximately 1600 hotel rooms 500 gaming tables and up to 2500 slots built on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau in addition we have been actively pursuing development opportunities in markets such as maryland and massachusetts 

in december 2013 our subsidiary mgm national harbor llc “mgm national harbor” was awarded the license to operate the sixth and final casino under current statutes in the state of maryland by the maryland video lottery facility location commission to build and operate a worldclass destination resort casino in prince george’s county at national harbor we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm national harbor to be approximately 10 billion excluding capitalized interest and land related costs we expect that the resort will include a casino with approximately 3600 slots 160 table games including poker a 300suite hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool highend branded retail fine and casual dining a dedicated 3000 seat theater venue 35000 square feet of meeting and event space and a 5000space parking structure 

 

we are the only remaining applicant for the casino license in western massachusetts one of three zones designated by legislation in december 2013 a unanimous vote from the massachusetts gaming commission “mgc” found us a suitable candidate for a casino license in the commonwealth we have since submitted to the mgc a completed license application for the next phase of the licensing process however there can be no assurance that the mgc will ultimately award us the license mgm springfield is proposed for 145 acres of land between union and state streets and columbus avenue and main street we currently expect the cost to develop and construct mgm springfield to be approximately 690 million excluding capitalized interest and land related costs 

in 2013 we formed a 5050 joint venture las vegas arena company llc “lva” with a subsidiary of anschutz entertainment group inc a leader in sports entertainment and promotions to design construct and operate an arena on a parcel of our land located between frank sinatra drive and new yorknew york adjacent to the las vegas strip the proposed arena is anticipated to seat between 18000 – 20000 people and is currently scheduled to be completed in 2016 such development is estimated to cost approximately 350 million and is contingent on lva obtaining permanent financing 

reportable segments 

we have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate wholly owned domestic resorts and mgm china we currently operate 15 wholly owned resorts in the united states mgm china’s operations consist of the mgm macau resort and casino “mgm macau” and the development of a casino resort in cotai we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates our mgm hospitality operations and certain other corporate and management operations citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate which we also manage for a fee our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results 

wholly owned domestic resorts at december 31 2013 our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts 

 



over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from nongaming operations including hotel food and beverage entertainment and other nongaming amenities we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities as a result of our leveraged business model our operating results are significantly affected by our ability to generate operating revenues also we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally 

key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are 

 

  

 mgm china on june 3 2011 we and ms ho pansy catilina chiu king “ms pansy ho” completed a reorganization of the capital structure and the initial public offering of 760 million shares of mgm china on the stock exchange of hong kong limited the “ipo” representing 20 of the post issuance base capital stock of mgm china at an offer price of hkd 1534 per share pursuant to this reorganization we acquired through a wholly owned subsidiary an additional 1 of the overall capital stock of mgm china for hkd 1534 per share or approximately 75 million and thereby became the owner of 51 of mgm china following the ipo the underwriters exercised their overallotment rights with respect to 59 million shares mgm china owns mgm grand paradise the macau company that owns the mgm macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions and is in the process of developing a gaming resort in cotai see below for additional information about the cotai development project 

through the acquisition of the additional 1 interest of mgm china we obtained a controlling interest and were required to consolidate mgm china as of june 3 2011 prior to the ipo we held a 50 interest in mgm grand paradise which was accounted for under the equity method the acquisition of the controlling financial interest was accounted for as a business combination and we recognized 100 of the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests of mgm china at fair value at the date of acquisition the fair value of the equity of mgm china was determined by the ipo transaction price and equaled approximately 75 billion the carrying value of our equity method investment was significantly less than our share of the fair value of mgm china resulting in a 35 billion gain on the acquisition 

we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability asia is the fastestgrowing gaming market in the world and macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue 

in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of macau to develop a resort and casino on an approximately 178 acre site in cotai macau the land concession contract became effective when the macau government published the agreement in the official gazette of macau on january 9 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years the total land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is approximately 161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semiannual payments as of december 31 2013 mgm china had paid 71 million of the contract premium recorded within “other longterm assets net” in january 2014 mgm china paid the second semiannual payment of 15 million under the land concession contract including interest on the six remaining semiannual payments mgm china has approximately 88 million remaining payable for the land concession contract in addition mgm grand paradise is required to pay the macau government approximately 269000 per year in rent during the course of development of the land and approximately 681000 per year in rent once the development is completed the annual rent is subject to review by the macau government every five years under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land by january 2018 in october 2012 mgm china and mgm grand paradise as coborrowers successfully closed on a 20 billion amended and restated credit facility agreement the proceeds of such facility are expected to be used in part to finance the construction of the cotai project mgm china has finalized the design of the mgm cotai project hired a general contractor and construction of the foundation commenced in 2013 

 

revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market vip casino gaming operations main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by inhouse vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau assist these customers with travel arrangements and extend gaming credit to these players in exchange for their services gaming promoters are compensated through payment of commission inhouse vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate the main floor gaming operation in macau is also referred to as the “mass gaming operation” mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walkin and day trip visitors unlike vip players main floor players do not receive commissions the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future 

vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips called “rolling chips” gaming promoters purchase these rolling chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players the rolling chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine vip gaming play gaming promoter commissions are based on either a percentage of actual win plus a monthly complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the rolling chip turnover their customers generate or a percentage of the rolling chip turnover plus discounted offerings on nongaming amenities the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense inhouse vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue

 our results of operations include the results of mgm china on a consolidated basis following the june 3 2011 date of acquisition prior to that date results of operations of mgm macau were reflected under the equity method of accounting – see “operating results – income loss from unconsolidated affiliates” 

consolidated operating income of 11 billion in 2013 benefited from an increase in revenues at mgm china and our wholly owned domestic resorts as well as decreases in corporate expense and depreciation and amortization expense comparability between periods was affected by 125 million of property transactions in 2013 compared to 708 million in 2012 

consolidated operating income in 2012 benefited from a full year of operations at mgm china as well as improved operating results at our wholly owned domestic resorts compared to 2011 comparability between periods was affected by the 35 billion gain on the mgm china transaction in 2011 708 million of property transactions in 2012 compared to 179 million in 2011 as well as the impairment charge relating to citycenter’s residential inventory and harmon demolition costs in 2012 operating income in 2012 was negatively impacted by increases in corporate expense and depreciation and amortization expense 

 

corporate expense decreased 8 to 217 million in 2013 due primarily to a decrease in costs related to development efforts in massachusetts and maryland which were mainly incurred in 2012 and the first half of 2013 corporate expense was 235 million in 2012 an increase of 34 compared to 2011 due to an increase in costs related to these development efforts and additional legal and professional services 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 78 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to lower amortization expense at mgm china as a result of extending the useful life of the gaming subconcession upon effectiveness of our cotai land concession agreement depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily from the consolidation of the full year results of mgm china of the 375 million of depreciation and amortization expense at mgm china in 2012 320 million related to amortization of intangible assets recognized in the acquisition

investment in grand victoria at june 30 2013 we reviewed the carrying value of our grand victoria investment for impairment due to a higher than anticipated decline in operating results and loss of market share as a result of the opening of a new riverboat casino in the illinois market as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to the prior forecast we used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value from a market participant’s viewpoint key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures a longterm growth rate of 2 and a discount rate of 11 key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprise value multiples selected based on the range of multiples in the company’s peer group as a result of the analysis we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 37 million at june 30 2013 based on an estimated fair value of 170 million for our 50 interest we intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment in grand victoria however due to the extent of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our investment we determined that the impairment was otherthantemporary 

at june 30 2012 we reviewed the carrying value of our grand victoria investment for impairment due to a decrease in operating results at the property and the loss of market share as a result of the opening of a new riverboat casino in the illinois market as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows we used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value key assumptions included in the analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures a longterm growth rate of 2 and a discount rate of 105 as a result of the discounted cash flow analysis we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 85 million based on an estimated fair value of 205 million for our 50 interest 

investment in borgata we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge for our investment in borgata of 65 million as of december 31 2012 using an estimated fair value for 

 

our investment of 120 million based on a discounted cash flow analysis borgata’s 2012 operating results did not meet previous forecasts while 2012 results for borgata were significantly impacted by hurricane sandy management believed the challenging environment in atlantic city would continue and lowered 2013 estimates below what was previously forecasted additionally we used a longterm growth rate of 25 and a discount rate of 105 based on our assessment of risk associated with the estimated cash flows this analysis is sensitive to management assumptions and increases or decreases in these assumptions would have a material impact on the analysis 

we determined that it was necessary to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge for our investment in borgata of 62 million as of december 31 2011 using an estimated fair value for our investment of 185 million based on a discounted cash flow analysis key assumptions in such analysis include management’s estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures an appropriate discount rate and longterm growth rate at the time there was significant uncertainty surrounding borgata’s future operating results due primarily to the planned opening of a major new resort in the atlantic city market during 2012 and other additional competition expected in surrounding markets as a result for purposes of this analysis we reflected a decrease in forecasted cash flows in 2012 and 2013 additionally we used a longterm growth rate of 3 and a discount rate of 105 based on our assessment of risk associated with the estimated cash flows 

las vegas strip land we own 335 acres on the north end of the las vegas strip which we have been holding for future development during 2012 we focused our development efforts on other jurisdictions which led to us reviewing our significant development land holdings for impairment indicators due to our focus on future development outside of the las vegas area we did not believe it was likely we would recover the carrying value of our 335 acres of land on the north end of the las vegas strip on an undiscounted basis therefore we recorded an impairment charge of 366 million as of december 31 2012 based on an estimated fair value of 214 million for the land we determined fair value of the land using a market approach based on an assessment of comparable land sales in las vegas adjusted for size and location factors based on comparisons to our land

investment in silver legacy we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge at december 31 2011 which decreased the carrying value of our investment in silver legacy to zero and ceased applying the equity method for our investment in silver legacy silver legacy had approximately 143 million of outstanding senior secured notes that were due in march 2012 silver legacy did not repay its notes at maturity and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in may 2012 these notes were nonrecourse to us in november 2012 silver legacy completed a consensual plan of reorganization pursuant to which the holders of the senior secured notes received a combination of cash and new second lien notes concurrently silver legacy entered into an agreement for a new 70 million senior secured credit facility which provided for a portion of the exit financing associated with the plan of reorganization as part of the reorganization the partners invested 75 million each in the form of subordinated sponsor notes we resumed the equity method of accounting for our investment in silver legacy subsequent to completion of the reorganization 

circus circus reno at september 30 2011 we reviewed the carrying value of our circus circus reno longlived assets for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by management for that resort in the third quarter of 2011 due to the then current and forecasted market conditions and results of operations through september 30 2011 being lower than previous forecasts we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 

 

80 million in the third quarter of 2011 primarily related to a writedown of circus circus reno’s longlived assets our discounted cash flow analysis for circus circus reno included estimated future cash inflows from operations and estimated future cash outflows for capital expenditures utilizing an estimated pretax discount rate of 165 and a longterm growth rate of 2

operating results – income loss from unconsolidated affiliates 

the following table summarizes information related to our income loss from unconsolidated affiliates 

 

 in 2013 we recognized 22 million of income related to our share of citycenter’s operating results including certain basis difference adjustments compared to a loss of 68 million in 2012 citycenter’s 2013 operating results benefited from a 6 increase in net revenues compared to the prior year casino revenues increased as a result of a 9 increase in table games volume and an increase in hold percentage from 232 in 2012 to 247 in 2013 rooms revenues increased 5 due to an increase in revpar at aria and vdara of 4 and 5 respectively the increase in revenues from resort operations was partially offset by a decrease in residential revenues 

in 2012 and 2011 our share of citycenter’s operating losses included our share of residential inventory impairment charges of 18 million and 26 million respectively citycenter is required to carry its residential inventory at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell fair value of the residential inventory is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s current expectations of future cash flows the key inputs in the discounted cash flow analysis include estimated sales prices of units currently under contract and new unit sales the absorption rate over the sellout period and the discount rate in addition citycenter accrued 32 million in 2012 related to the estimated demolition cost of the harmon we recognized 50 of such charge resulting in a charge of approximately 16 million 

we ceased recording mgm macau operating results as income from unconsolidated affiliates under the equity method of accounting in june 2011 

 

nonoperating results 

interest expense the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt 

 

 in 2013 gross interest costs decreased compared to 2012 primarily as a result of the december 2012 refinancing transactions in 2012 gross interest costs increased compared to 2011 primarily as a result of the consolidation of mgm china and an increase in weighted average longterm debt outstanding during the year amortization of debt discounts premiums and issuance costs included in interest expense in 2013 2012 and 2011 was 35 million 73 million and 94 million respectively 

nonoperating items from unconsolidated affiliates nonoperating expense from unconsolidated affiliates increased 67 million compared to 2012 related primarily to a 70 million loss for our share of citycenter’s loss on retirement of longterm debt in 2013 primarily consisting of premiums associated with the redemption of citycenter’s first and second lien notes as well as the writeoff of previously unamortized debt issuance costs in december 2013 silver legacy entered into a new senior credit facility and redeemed its outstanding second lien notes silver legacy recognized a gain of 24 million in connection with these transactions we recognized 12 million our share of the gain 

other net in 2013 we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of 4 million related to the repricing of the term loan b credit facility in 2012 we recorded a loss on retirement of debt of 107 million related to the amendment and restatement of our credit facility in february and december and a loss on retirement of debt related to the tender offers redemption and discharge of our senior secured notes of 457 million 

we hold south jersey transportation authority special revenue bonds the original proceeds from which were used to provide funding for the atlantic citybrigantine connector project the repayment of the remaining principal and interest for the bonds is supported by eligible investment alternative tax obligation payments made to the casino reinvestment development authority from future casino licensees on the renaissance pointe land owned by us we have assumed no future cash flows will be received to support the carrying value of the bonds and recorded an otherthantemporary impairment of 47 million as of december 31 2012 because we believed the probability for casino development on renaissance pointe in the foreseeable future was remote due to the continued deterioration of the atlantic city market and initial underperformance of a resort that opened in the market 

income taxes the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 

  

in 2013 no income tax benefit was recorded for domestic book losses because we provided a valuation allowance against such losses in addition our foreign jurisdiction book income is taxed at essentially a zero percent tax rate due primarily to the exemption from macaus 12 complementary tax on gaming profits consequently absent nonrecurring taxation events our effective tax rate would have been approximately 5 in 2013 however due primarily to tax expense resulting from remeasuring the macau net deferred tax liability due to the extension of the amortization period of the mgm china gaming subconcession upon effectiveness of the cotai land concession offset in part by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation the effective tax rate for 2013 approximated the 35 us statutory rate the income tax benefit on pretax loss in 2012 was substantially below the 35 statutory rate due primarily to the fact that we began recording a valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets during the year we recorded an income tax benefit in 2011 even though we had pretax income for the year because we did not provide us deferred taxes on the 35 billion gain recorded on the acquisition of the controlling financial interest in mgm china excluding the mgm china gain we would have provided income tax benefit at an effective tax rate of 607 for 2011 higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to an income tax benefit resulting from a decrease to the macau net deferred tax liability recorded to reflect an assumed fiveyear extension of the exemption from complementary tax on gaming profits and a lower effective tax rate on mgm china earnings 

cash taxes paid in 2013 and 2012 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes the net refund of cash taxes in 2011 was due primarily to the carryback to prior years of us federal income tax net operating losses incurred in 2010 and 2009 respectively all us net operating loss carryback refund potential was realized as a result of these carrybacks and tax net operating losses may now only be carried forward 

nongaap measures 

“adjusted ebitda” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses property transactions net and the gain on the mgm china transaction “adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts stock option plan which is not allocated to each property mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies

we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of wholly owned domestic resorts operating performance 

adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments 

 

taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda in a different manner 

the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows – summary

our cash flows consisted of the following 

 

 cash flows – operating activities 

trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income excluding noncash charges but can be affected by changes in working capital the timing of significant tax payments or refunds and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates cash provided by operating activities increased due to increased operating cash flow at mgm china  932 million in 2013 compared to 751 million in the prior year  positively affected by changes in working capital primarily related to short term gaming liabilities in 2013 operating cash flow also benefited from a decrease in interest payments in 2012 increased cash flows at our resorts were offset by lower tax refunds received compared to the prior year period we paid net taxes of 1 million and 7 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and received net tax refunds of approximately 172 million in 2011 

 

cash flows – investing activities 

our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts business acquisitions or dispositions and the timing of more regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts capital expenditures related to more regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms most of such costs relate to materials furniture and fixtures and external labor costs

    in 2011 excluding the 778 million we repaid in early january 2012 on our senior secured credit facility we repaid 60 million of net debt including 91 million repaid by mgm china under its senior credit facility for the period from june 3 2011 through december 31 2011 we issued 300 million of 425 convertible senior notes due 2015 for net proceeds of 311 million which were used to pay down borrowings under our senior credit facility in addition we repaid the following senior notes 

 

    other factors affecting liquidity 

anticipated uses of cash as of december 31 2013 we had 537 million of principal amount of longterm debt maturing and an estimated 823 million of cash interest payments based on current outstanding debt and applicable interest rates within the next twelve months 

in addition we expect to make the following capital investments during 2014 

 

     

during 2014 mgm china expects to spend approximately 70 million in capital improvements at mgm macau and 500 million on the mgm cotai project excluding capitalized interest and land 

our capital expenditures fluctuate depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure of our ownership interests in future developments 

cotai land concession in october 2012 mgm grand paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government for its planned development in cotai the land concession contract became effective on january 9 2013 when the macau government published it in the official gazette of macau and has an initial term of 25 years the land premium payable to the macau government for the land concession contract is 161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semiannual payments as of december 31 2013 mgm china had paid 71 million of the contract premium recorded within “other longterm assets net” in january 2014 mgm china paid the second semiannual payment of 15 million under the land concession contract including interest on the six remaining semiannual payments mgm china has 88 million remaining payable for the land concession contract in addition mgm grand paradise is required to pay the macau government 269000 per year in rent during the course of development of the land and 681000 per year in rent once the development is completed the annual rent is subject to review by the macau government every five years mgm china has made significant progress in getting its construction team in place as well as finalizing its designs under the terms of the land concession contract mgm grand paradise is required to complete the development of the land within 60 months from the date of publication 

mgm china dividend policy in february 2013 mgm china adopted a distribution policy pursuant to which it may make semiannual distributions in an aggregate amount per year not to exceed 35 of its anticipated consolidated annual profits in accordance with the policy mgm china may also declare special distributions from time to time the determination to make distributions will be made at the discretion of the mgm china board of directors and will be based upon mgm china’s operations and earnings development pipeline cash flows financial condition capital and other reserve requirements and surplus general financial conditions contractual restrictions including restrictions on its ability to pay dividends or distributions in the mgm china credit facility and any other conditions or factors which the board of directors deems relevant as a result there can be no assurance that distributions will be declared in the future or the amount or timing of such distributions if any 

on february 19 2014 as part of its regular dividend policy mgm china’s board of directors announced it will recommend a final dividend for 2013 of 128 million to mgm china shareholders subject to approval at the 2014 annual shareholders meeting in addition mgm china’s board of directors announced a special dividend of 500 million which will be paid to shareholders of record as of march 10 2014 and distributed on or about march 17 2014 we will receive 255 million representing our 51 share of the special dividend 

citycenter completion guarantee  in october 2013 we entered into a third amended and restated completion and cost overrun guarantee which is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of circus circus las vegas as well as certain undeveloped land adjacent to that property the terms of the amended and restated completion guarantee provide citycenter the ability to utilize up to 72 million of net residential proceeds to fund construction costs or to reimburse us for construction costs previously expended as of december 31 2013 citycenter is holding approximately 72 million in a separate bank account representing the remaining condo proceeds available to fund completion guarantee obligations or be reimbursed to us in accordance with the amended and restated completion guarantee such amounts can only be used to fund construction lien obligations or reimbursed to us once the perini litigation is settled 

as of december 31 2013 we had funded 716 million under the completion guarantee and have accrued a liability of 97 million which includes estimated litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes with contractors concerning the final construction costs and estimated amounts to be paid to contractors through the 

 

legal process related to the perini litigation we do not believe it is reasonably possible we could be liable for amounts in excess of what we have accrued our estimated obligation has been offset by 72 million of condominium proceeds received by citycenter which are available to fund construction lien claims upon the resolution of the perini litigation also our accrual reflects certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the contractors moreover we have not accrued for any contingent payments to citycenter related to the harmon component which will not be completed using the building as it now stands see note 11 in the accompanying financial statements for discussion of the status of the harmon 

we do not believe we would be responsible for funding under the completion guarantee any additional remediation efforts that might be required with respect to the harmon however our view is based on a number of developing factors including with respect to ongoing litigation with citycenter’s contractors actions by local officials and other developments related to the citycenter venture all of which are subject to change 

principal debt arrangements 

our longterm debt consists of publicly held senior senior subordinated and convertible senior notes and our senior secured credit facility at december 31 2013 excluding mgm china we had 129 billion principal amount of indebtedness including 28 billion of borrowings outstanding under our 40 billion senior credit facility we pay fixed rates of interest ranging from 425 to 11375 on our senior convertible senior and subordinated notes in december 2012 we amended and restated our senior secured credit facility concurrently with the tender offers for all of our senior secured notes and the issuance of 125 billion of 6625 senior notes due 2021 the amended and restated senior secured credit facility consists of 12 billion of revolving loans a 104 billion term loan a facility and a 173 billion term loan b facility the revolving and term loan a facilities bear interest at libor plus an applicable rate determined by our credit rating 275 as of december 31 2013 the term loan b facility bears interest at libor plus 250 with a libor floor of 100 35 as of december 31 2013 the revolving and term loan a facilities mature in december 2017 the term loan b facility matures in december 2019 the term loan a and term loan b facilities are subject to scheduled amortization payments beginning on the last day of each calendar quarter from and after march 31 2013 in an amount equal to 025 of the original principal balance we had approximately 12 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility at december 31 2013 

the land and substantially all of the assets of mgm grand las vegas bellagio and the mirage secure up to 335 billion of obligations outstanding under the senior secured credit facility in addition the land and substantially all of the assets of new yorknew york and gold strike tunica secure the entire amount of the senior secured credit facility and the land and substantially all of the assets of mgm grand detroit secure its obligations as a coborrower under the senior secured credit facility initially equal to 450 million in addition the senior secured credit facility is secured by a pledge of the equity or limited liability company interests of the subsidiaries that own the pledged properties 

the senior secured credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants in addition the senior secured credit facility requires us and our restricted subsidiaries to maintain a minimum trailing fourquarter ebitda and limits our ability to make capital expenditures and investments as of december 31 2013 we and our restricted subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum ebitda as defined of 105 billion the minimum ebitda increases to 110 billion for march 31 2014 and june 30 2014 and to 120 billion for september 30 2014 and december 31 2014 with periodic increases thereafter ebitda for the trailing twelve months ended december 31 2013 calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior secured credit facility was 131 billion in accordance with our senior credit facility covenants we and our restricted subsidiaries are limited to annual capital expenditures as defined in the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility of 500 million in each year beginning with 2013 with unused amounts in any fiscal year rolling over to the next fiscal year but not any fiscal year thereafter we were within the limit of 500 million of capital expenditures for the calendar year 2013 in addition our senior secured credit facility limits our ability to make investments subject to certain thresholds and other important exceptions we believe we have sufficient capacity under these thresholds to fund our planned development activity 

 

the senior secured credit facility provides for customary events of default including without limitation i payment defaults ii covenant defaults iii crossdefaults to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts iv certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency v judgment defaults in excess of specified amounts vi the failure of any loan document by a significant party to be in full force and effect and such circumstance in the reasonable judgment of the required lenders is materially adverse to the lenders or vii the security documents cease to create a valid and perfected first priority lien on any material portion of the collateral in addition the senior secured credit facility provides that a cessation of business due to revocation suspension or loss of any gaming license affecting a specified amount of its revenues or assets will constitute an event of default 

all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our material domestic subsidiaries other than mgm grand detroit llc which is a coborrower under our senior credit facility our insurance subsidiaries and certain other designated subsidiaries including mgm national harbor our international subsidiaries including mgm china and its subsidiaries are not guarantors of such indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may from time to time in our sole discretion purchase repay redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise pursuant to authorization of our board of directors 

at december 31 2013 the mgm china credit facility consisted of approximately 550 million of term loans and a 145 billion revolving credit facility due october 2017 the outstanding balance at december 31 2013 of 553 million was comprised solely of term loans the interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on hibor plus a margin which ranges between 175 and 25 based on mgm china’s leverage ratio mgm china is a joint and several coborrower with mgm grand paradise the material subsidiaries of mgm china guarantee the facilities and mgm china mgm grand paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest still subject to approval on substantially all of their assets to secure the amended facilities the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes and for the development of the cotai project 

the mgm china credit facility agreement contains customary representations and warranties events of default affirmative covenants and negative covenants which impose restrictions on among other things the ability of mgm china and its subsidiaries to make investments pay dividends and sell assets and to incur additional debt and additional liens mgm china is also required to maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio of 450 to 100 prior to the first anniversary of the mgm cotai opening date and 400 to 100 thereafter and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 250 to 100 mgm china was in compliance with its credit facility covenants at december 31 2013 

off balance sheet arrangements 

our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter grand victoria and silver legacy we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we have not historically guaranteed financing obtained by our investees and there are no other provisions of the venture agreements which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort 

 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 

 

  

    while we have significant indebtedness we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures over the next few years with cash flows from operations and availability under our senior credit facility we have 537 million of maturities of longterm debt in 2014 and the price per share of our common stock as of december 31 2013 was above the conversion price of our 145 billion 425 convertible senior notes due 2015 see “liquidity and capital resources – other factors affecting liquidity” for further discussion of anticipated uses of cash 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates 

 

business combinations 

we accounted for our acquisition of mgm china in june 2011 as a business combination and have historically had significant acquisitions accounted for as business combinations in a business combination we determine the fair value of acquired assets including identifiable intangible assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests the fair value of the acquired business is allocated to the acquired assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests based on their fair value with any remaining fair value allocated to goodwill this allocation process requires use of estimates and assumptions including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets identifiable finitelife intangible assets such as certain license rights and customer lists are amortized over the intangible asset’s estimated useful life the method of amortization reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed if determinable normally estimated based on estimated future cash flows of the intangible asset goodwill as well as other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment as discussed further below 

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts in addition mgm china extends credit to certain inhouse vip gaming customers and gaming promoters our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 31 and 27 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 57 and 63 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability among other factors when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the united states 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 

in addition to enforceability issues the collectibility of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables 

 

 approximately 78 million of casino receivables and 4 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31 2013 the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due primarily to strong collections which resulted in a decrease in the aging of accounts at december 31 2013 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by 3 million 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values in connection with the june 2011 mgm china acquisition the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment in addition our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as a held for sale or b to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset for operating assets fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are 

 

discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors significant changes to our operating environment or changes in intended use of the asset group we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group including potential sale historically undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group with the exception of the impairment of goodwill attributed to railroad pass in 2011 none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2013 2012 or 2011 as of the date we completed our 2013 goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair values of our reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values as discussed below management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

see “operating results – details of certain charges” for further discussion of write downs and impairments of longlived assets 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in value if such conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is otherthantemporary based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain 

 

our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group see “operating results – details of certain charges” for discussion of otherthantemporary impairment charges 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied given the negative impact of the us economy on the results of operations in the past several years we no longer rely on future domestic operating income in assessing the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets and now rely only on the future reversal of existing domestic taxable temporary differences as of december 31 2013 the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences and we provide a valuation allowance for this excess at december 31 2013 such valuation allowance was 165 billion in addition there is a 16 million valuation allowance after federal effect provided on certain state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of 56 million on certain macau deferred tax assets because we believe these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition 

our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities 

we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in “other accrued liabilities” or longterm in “other longterm liabilities” based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material 

as of december 31 2013 we are no longer subject to examination of our us consolidated federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2005 the irs completed its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years during 2010 and we paid 12 million in tax and 4 million in associated interest with respect to adjustments to which we agreed and protested with irs appeals issues to which we did not agree we favorably settled during the first quarter of 2013 all issues on appeal with irs appeals resulting in a refund of 2 million including interest during the fourth quarter of 2010 the irs opened an examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years the irs completed its examination during 2013 and we have tentatively agreed to all proposed adjustments this agreement is subject to final approval from the joint committee on taxation and the examination will not be considered settled until such approval is received which we anticipate will occur in the next twelve months we deposited 30 million with the irs to cover the expected cash taxes and interest resulting from the tentatively agreed adjustments for this examination and the examinations discussed below 

during the first quarter of 2011 the irs opened examinations of the 2007 through 2008 tax years of citycenter holdings llc an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and the 2008 through 2009 tax years of mgm grand detroit llc a subsidiary treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the irs completed these examinations in 2013 and we agreed to all proposed adjustments the impact of these adjustments is included in the 30 million deposit described above 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we and our joint venture partner reached tentative settlement with irs appeals with respect to the audit of the 2003 and 2004 tax years of a cost method investee of ours that is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the adjustments to which we agreed in such tentative settlement were included in the final settlement we reached with irs appeals with respect to the 2003 and 2004 examination of our consolidated federal income tax return the irs completed during 2013 its examination of the 2005 through 2009 tax years of this investee and we agreed to all proposed adjustments the impact of these adjustments is included in the 30 million deposit described above 

as of december 31 2013 other than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above and the exceptions noted below we were no longer subject to examination of our various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2009 the state of michigan initiated during the second quarter of 2013 a review of the michigan business tax returns of mgm grand detroit llc for the 2009 through 2011 tax years to determine whether to open an examination of one or more of these years but has not yet indicated whether such an examination will take place during 2010 the state of illinois initiated an audit of our illinois combined returns for the 2006 and 2007 tax years such audit closed in 2012 resulting in an immaterial refund of taxes from such years during 2010 the state of new jersey began audit procedures of a cost method investee of ours for the 2003 through 2006 tax years no other state or local income tax returns are currently under exam 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted share units “rsus” compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant we account for performance stock units “psus” measuring fair value using the monte carlo valuation model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model and monte carlo valuation model our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the blackscholes model can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the monte carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions including volatility to determine the fair value of the award changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of sharebased compensation and consequently the related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year 

market risk 

in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations we are also exposed to additional market risks market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions 

as of december 31 2013 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 25 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of term loan b over the 1 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 28 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2013 assuming a 100 basispoint increase in hibor for the mgm grand paradise credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 6 million based 

 

on amounts outstanding at december 31 2013 the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates

our strategy is to generate sustainable profitable growth by creating and maintaining competitive advantages and through the execution of our business plan which is focused on 

 

  

resort portfolio 

 

we execute our strategy through a portfolio approach seeking to ensure that we own manage and invest in resorts that are superior to our competitors’ resorts in the markets in which our resorts are located as well as across our customer base our customer base is discussed below under “resort operation” 

 

we selectively acquire invest in and develop resorts in markets with a stable regulatory history and environment as seen in the table below this means that a large portion of our resorts are located in nevada we target markets with growth potential and we believe there is growth potential in investing in and managing both gaming and nongaming resorts our growth strategies are discussed in greater detail below under “sustainable growth and leveraging our brand and management assets” 

 

our operating resorts 

 

we have provided certain information below about our resorts as of december 31 2010 except as otherwise indicated we wholly own and operate the resorts shown below

more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 

 

portfolio strategy 

 

we believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments that target our goal of creating the best possible experiences for our guests we have historically made significant investments in our resorts through the addition of new restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings and other new features and amenities in addition we have made regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our hotel rooms and public spaces the quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards such as several four and five diamond designations from the american automobile association and four and five star designations from mobil travel 

 

we also actively manage our portfolio of land holdings we own approximately 670 acres of land on the las vegas strip with a meaningful portion of those acres undeveloped acreage or acreage we consider to be underdeveloped 

 

risks associated with our portfolio strategy 

 

certain principal risk factors relating to our current portfolio of resorts are 

 

  

see “item 1a risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors 

resort operation 

 

our operating philosophy is to create resorts of memorable character to treat our employees as valued and respected team members and to provide superior service for our guests in addition we also seek to develop competitive advantages in specific markets and among specific customer groups 

 

general 

 

we primarily own and operate casino resorts that include gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities over half of our net revenue is derived from nongaming activities a higher percentage than many of our competitors as we provide a complete resort experience for our guests including high quality nongaming amenities for which our guests are willing to pay a premium 

 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities since we believe that the number of walkin customers affects the success of our casino resorts we design our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other hotels we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming segment which can cause variability in our results 

 

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year our significant convention and meeting facilities are utilized to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our results do not depend on key individual customers although our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers or the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a particular country or region can affect our results 

 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our whollyowned resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we generally have an operating philosophy that favors ownership and management of amenities since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience however we do lease space to retail and food and beverage operators particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible we also operate many “managed” outlets utilizing thirdparty management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs as well as for branding opportunities 

 

customers and competition 

 

our casino resorts generally operate in highly competitive environments we compete against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality and leisure and business travel companies our primary methods of successful competition include 

 

 3 

 

  

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the las vegas area including major hotel casinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotel casinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 149000 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 at december 31 2010 we operated approximately 28 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 373 million in 2010 a 3 increase from the 364 million reported for 2009 

 

the principal segments of the las vegas gaming market are leisure travel premium gaming customers conventions including small meetings trade associations and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel our luxury whollyowned properties including bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome customers largely from the leisure travel and to a lesser extent the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments 

 

outside las vegas our other whollyowned nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and larger operations our nevada resorts located outside of las vegas appeal primarily to the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer a significant number of our customers at these resorts come from california we believe the expansion of native american gaming in california has had a negative impact on all of our nevada resorts not located on the las vegas strip and additional expansion in california could have a further adverse effect on these resorts 

 

outside nevada our whollyowned resorts primarily compete for customers in local and regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success for instance in tunica mississippi one of our competitors is closer to memphis the area’s principal market in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for example in detroit michigan we also compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we also compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas 

 

aria which we manage and of which we own 50 through the citycenter joint venture “citycenter” appeals to the upper end of each segment in the las vegas market and competes with our whollyowned luxury casino resorts our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets much like our whollyowned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts 

 

our casino resorts also compete for customers with hotel casino operations located in other areas of the united states and other parts of the world and for leisure and business travelers with nongaming tourist destinations such as hawaii florida and california our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states 

 

marketing 

 

we advertise on the radio television internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as by direct mail and through the use of social media we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major us and foreign cities a key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention segment we maintain internet websites to inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets we actively utilize several social media sites to promote our brands unique events and special deals we also operate call centers to allow customer contact by phone to make hotel and restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets 

we recently introduced a new players club loyalty program “m life” m life was introduced at our regional resorts in the third quarter of 2010 and to the remaining participating whollyowned casino resorts and aria on january 11 2011 m life is our new player loyalty program that provides access to rewards privileges and membersonly events m life is a tiered system and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts regardless of where they play encouraging customers to keep their total gaming spend within our casino resorts 

 

m life combines slots and table games play into one account and customers earn tiered rewards on both types of play customers earn “express comps” which can be redeemed at restaurants box offices the m life players club or kiosks at participating properties players can also redeem their express comps for m life “moments” which allow members to take advantage of unique and onceinalifetime experiences such as picking the bellagio fountain songs for a day being a trainer for a day with the dolphins at the mirage and meetandgreets with performers and celebrity chefs across our resort portfolio members of m life also continue to earn points redeemable for free play 

 

m life is currently a casino centered program but will expand to a broadbased program recognizing and rewarding customer spending across most channels focusing on wallet share capture loyalty and frequency of visits advanced analytic techniques and new information technology will better identify customer preferences and predict future behavior allowing us to make customers more relevant offers influence incremental visits and help build lasting customer relationships 

 

in addition to the loyalty program we have rebranded our company magazine and developed an inroom m life television channel to highlight customers’ experiences and showcase “moments” customers can earn through the accumulation of express comps we believe that m life will enable us to more effectively market to our customers as well as allow us to personalize customers’ experiences 

 

we also utilize our worldclass golf courses in marketing programs at our las vegas strip resorts our major las vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at shadow creek in north las vegas in connection with our marketing activities we also invite our premium gaming customers to play shadow creek on a complimentary basis we also use primm valley golf club for marketing purposes at our las vegas strip resorts additionally marketing efforts at beau rivage benefit from fallen oak golf course 20 minutes north of beau rivage 

 

employees and management 

 

we believe that knowledgeable friendly and dedicated employees are a key success factor in the casino resort industry therefore we invest heavily in recruiting training and retaining exceptional highly motivated employees as well as seeking to hire and promote the strongest management team possible we have numerous programs both at the corporate and business unit level designed to achieve these objectives for example our diversity initiative extends throughout our company and focuses on the unique strengths of our individuals combined with a culture of collaborative teamwork to achieve greater performance our diversity program has been widely recognized and has received numerous awards we believe our internal development programs such as the mgm resorts university and various leadership and management training programs are best in class among our industry peers 

 

technology 

 

we utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations we continue to move forward on standardizing the technology platforms for our hotel and point of sale systems along with several other key operational systems the standardization of these systems provides us with one consistent operating platform allowing us efficiencies in training reducing complexity in system integration and interfaces standardizing processes across our casino resorts and providing our customers with better information in connection with the implementation of m life 

 

technology is also an important part of our strategy in nongaming and administrative operations our hotel systems include yield management software programs at many of our resorts that help us maximize occupancy and room rates additionally these systems capture charges made by our customers during their stay including allowing customers of our resorts to charge meals and services at our other resorts to their hotel accounts 

corporate sustainability 

 

we continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive companywide environmental responsibility initiatives during 2010 we were the first resorts in nevada and michigan to earn certification from green key the largest international program evaluating sustainable hotel operations we received certifications at 12 resorts including “five green key” the highest possible ratings at aria vdara and mandalay bay many major travel service providers recognize the green key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations we believe that our sustainability efforts are particularly beneficial in meeting and convention bookings as corporations and associations seek to extend their environmentally responsible practices by doing business with likeminded environmentally friendly companies 

 

in addition we believe that incorporating the tenets of sustainability in our business decisions provides a platform for innovation citycenter is one of the world’s largest private green developments aria vdara crystals mandarin oriental veer and the aria convention center all have received leed ® gold certification by the us green building council this marks the highest leed achievement for any hotel retail district or residential development in las vegas with this accomplishment citycenter created a new standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the largescale hospitality industry 

 

internal controls 

 

we have a strong culture of compliance driven by our history in the highly regulated gaming industry and our belief that compliance is a valueadded activity our system of internal controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting – is designed to promote reliable and accurate financial records transparent disclosures compliance with laws and regulations and protection of our assets our internal controls start at the source of business transactions and we have rigorous enforcement at both the business unit and corporate level 

 

our corporate management also reviews each of our businesses on a regular basis and we have a corporate internal audit function that performs regular reviews regarding gaming compliance internal controls over financial reporting and operations 

 

in addition we maintain a compliance committee that administers our companywide compliance plan the compliance plan is in place to promote compliance with gaming and other laws applicable to our operations in all jurisdictions including performing background investigations on our current and potential employees directors and vendors as well as thorough review of proposed transactions and associations 

 

in connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements and other activities including cash transaction reporting which is essential in our industry our controls surrounding cash transactions include locked cash boxes on the casino floor daily cash counts performed by employees who are independent of casino operations constant observation and supervision of the gaming area observation and recording of gaming and other areas by closedcircuit television constant computer monitoring of our slot machines and timely analysis of deviations from expected performance 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at aria bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at certain of those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to timely pay their marker balances these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices direct personal contact and the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation 

 

in our us jurisdictions amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are enforceable under state laws and all other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts owed pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution amounts owed for markers that are not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries but the us assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states

certain principal risk factors relating to our operating strategy are 

 

  

see “item 1a risk factors” for a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors 

 

sustainable growth and leveraging our brand and management assets 

 

in allocating resources our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts spending on new resorts or initiatives and repaying longterm debt we believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns although these decisions have been significantly affected by economic conditions over the past several years as well as by the recent financial crisis which limited our access to capital 

 

we regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the domestic and international markets but cannot at this time determine the likelihood of proceeding with specific development opportunities opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in nevada or in states other than nevada or outside of the united states we may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties 

 

we leverage our management expertise and wellrecognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities we feel that several of our brands particularly the “mgm grand” “bellagio” and “skylofts” brands are well suited to new projects in both gaming and nongaming developments we formed mgm hospitality llc “mgm hospitality” to focus on strategic resort development and management opportunities with an emphasis on international opportunities which we believe offer the greatest opportunity for future growth we have hired senior personnel with established backgrounds in the development and management of international hospitality operations to maximize the profit potential of mgm hospitality’s operations mgm hospitality currently has management agreements for hotels in the middle east north africa india and china

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial positions results of operations or cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below 

 

risks related to our substantial indebtedness 

 

  

  

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned and managed properties to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished which requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly future development projects and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations events over the past several years including the failures and near failures of financial services companies and the decrease in liquidity and available capital have negatively affected the capital markets 

 

  

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2013 and 2014 and thereafter our ability to timely refinance and replace such indebtedness will depend upon the foregoing as well as on continued and sustained improvements in financial markets if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might 

be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to note holders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements 

 

  

  

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under the senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and could force us to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws 

 

risks related to our business

further our directors officers key employees and joint venture partners must meet approval standards of certain state regulatory authorities if state regulatory authorities were to find a person occupying any such position or a joint venture partner unsuitable we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint venture partner may be required to dispose of their interest in the joint venture state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or joint venture partners to ensure compliance with applicable standards for example as a result of the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the “dge” investigation of our relationship with our joint venture partner in macau we entered into a settlement agreement with the dge under which we were required to sell our 50 ownership interest in borgata and related leased land in atlantic city 

 

certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions that we are party to also require the approval of some state regulatory authorities 

 

in addition to gaming regulations we are also subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters smoking employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted for example illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places including bars restaurants work places schools and casinos the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance

for instance citycenter which is 50 owned and managed by us has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations if citycenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our partners are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary such event could have adverse financial consequences to us in addition the agreements governing the indebtedness subject citycenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness place liens upon assets make distributions to us make certain investments consummate certain asset sales enter into transactions with affiliates including us and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets the citycenter amended and restated credit facility also requires citycenter to meet an interest coverage ratio test commencing on september 30 2012 we cannot be sure that citycenter will be able to meet this test or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test 

 

in addition in accordance with our joint venture agreement and the citycenter credit facility we provided a cost overrun guarantee which is secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land 

 

also the operation of mgm macau which is 50 owned by us is subject to unique risks including risks related to a our ability to adapt to the different regulatory and gaming environment in macau while remaining in compliance with the requirements of the gaming regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate as well as other applicable federal state or local laws in the united states and macau b potential political or economic instability and c the extreme weather conditions in the region

in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 

 

we renew our insurance policies other than our builder’s risk insurance on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage 

 

 17 

  

in addition tracinda may be able to exercise significant influence over us as a result of its significant ownership of our outstanding common stock as a result actions requiring stockholder approval that may be supported by other stockholders could be effectively blocked by tracinda 

 

  

  

these risks individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for example we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and antimoney laundering regulations any violation of antimoney laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business performance prospects value financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are also exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease

citycenter construction litigation in march 2010 perini building company inc general contractor for the citycenter development project the “project” filed a lawsuit in the eighth judicial district court for clark county state of nevada against mgm mirage design group a whollyowned subsidiary of the company which was the original party to the perini construction agreement and certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of citycenter holdings llc the “citycenter owners” perini asserts that the project was substantially completed but the defendants failed to pay perini approximately 490 million allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor equipment and materials expended on the project the complaint further charges the defendants with failure to provide timely and complete design documents late delivery to perini of design changes mismanagement of the change order process obstruction of perini’s ability to complete the harmon hotel  spa component and fraudulent inducement of perini to compromise significantly amounts due for its general conditions the complaint advances claims for breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel and fraud and intentional misrepresentation perini seeks compensatory damages punitive damages attorneys’ fees and costs 

in april 2010 perini served an amended complaint in this case which joins as defendants many owners of citycenter residential condominium units the “condo owner defendants” adds a count for foreclosure of perini’s recorded master mechanic’s lien against the citycenter property in the amount of approximately 491 million and asserts the priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the citycenter owners the condo owner defendants and the project lenders in the citycenter property 

 

the citycenter owners and the other defendants dispute perini’s allegations and contend that the defendants are entitled to substantial amounts from perini including offsets against amounts claimed to be owed to perini and its subcontractors and damages based on breach of their contractual and other duties to citycenter duplicative payment requests nonconforming work lack of proof of alleged work performance defective work related to the harmon hotel  spa component property damage and perini’s failure to perform its obligations to pay project subcontractors and to prevent filing of liens against the project parallel to the court litigation citycenter management conducted an extrajudicial program for settlement of project subcontractor claims citycenter has resolved the claims of the majority of the 223 firsttier subcontractors with only several remaining for further proceedings along with trial of perini’s claims and citycenter’s harmonrelated counterclaim and other claims by citycenter against perini and its parent guarantor tutor perini in december 2010 perini recorded an amended notice of lien reducing its lien to approximately 313 million 

 

the citycenter owners and the other defendants will continue to vigorously assert and protect their interests in the lawsuit the range of loss beyond the claims asserted to date by perini or any gain the joint venture may realize related to the defendants’ counterclaims cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following narrative provides information about our liquidity financial position results of operations and other factors affecting our current and future operating results 

 

executive overview 

 

current operations 

 

at december 31 2010 our operations primarily consisted of 15 whollyowned casino resorts and 50 investments in four other casino resorts 

 

 

 

other operations include the shadow creek golf course in north las vegas and fallen oak golf course in saucier mississippi we also own the primm valley golf club at the california state line which is currently operated by a third party under a lease agreement 

 

the other 50 of citycenter is owned by infinity world development corp “infinity world” a whollyowned subsidiary of dubai world a dubai united arab emirates government decree entity citycenter consists of aria a 4004room casino resort mandarin oriental las vegas a 392room nongaming boutique hotel crystals a retail district with 334000 of currently leaseable square feet and vdara a 1495room luxury condominiumhotel in addition citycenter features residential units in the residences at mandarin oriental – 225 units and veer – 669 units aria vdara mandarin oriental and crystals all opened in december 2009 and the sales of residential units within citycenter began closing in early 2010 we receive a management fee of 2 of revenues for the management of aria and vdara and 5 of ebitda as defined in the agreements governing our management of aria and vdara in addition we receive an annual fee of 3 million for the management of crystals 

 

liquidity and financial position 

 

we completed a series of capital markets transactions during 2010 and extended our senior credit facility as a result of these transactions we believe we will have sufficient liquidity from expected future cash flows and availability under our senior credit facility to meet our financial obligations through 2012 we have significant indebtedness and continue to evaluate opportunities to improve our financial condition but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to repay or effectively refinance our indebtedness in future periods 

 

capital markets transactions we completed the following transactions during 2010 

 

 25 

 

senior credit facility our senior credit facility was amended and restated in march 2010 and consisted of approximately 27 billion in term loans of which approximately 874 million was required to be repaid by october 3 2011 and a 20 billion revolving loan of which approximately 302 million was required to be repaid by october 3 2011 as discussed below in november 2010 we repaid the outstanding balance of the loans maturing in 2011 as of december 31 2010 our senior credit facility consisted of approximately 18 billion in term loans and 17 billion in revolving loans and had approximately 12 billion of available revolving borrowing capacity 

 

we accounted for the modification related to extending the term loans as an extinguishment of debt because the applicable cash flows under the extended term loans are more than 10 different from the applicable cash flows under the previous loans therefore the extended term loans were recorded at fair value resulting in a 181 million gain and a discount of 181 million to be amortized to interest expense over the term of the extended term loans for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 we recorded 31 million of interest related to the amortization of this discount fair value of the estimated term loans was based on trading prices immediately after the transaction in addition we wrote off 15 million of existing debt issuance costs related to the previous term loans and had expense of 22 million for new debt issuance costs incurred related to amounts paid to extending term loan lenders in connection with the modification we also wrote off 2 million of existing debt issuance costs related to the reduction in capacity under the nonextending revolving portion of the senior credit facility in total we recognized a net pretax gain on extinguishment of debt of 142 million in “other net” nonoperating income in the first quarter of 2010 

 

because net proceeds from our october 2010 common stock offering were in excess of 500 million we were required to ratably repay indebtedness under the senior credit facility of 6 million which equaled 50 of such excess we used the net proceeds from our october 2010 senior notes offering discussed above and a portion of the net proceeds from our october 2010 common stock offering to repay the remaining amounts owed to nonextending lenders under our senior credit facility loans and revolving commitments aggregating approximately 36 billion were extended to february 21 2014 in november 2010 the underwriters of our common stock offering exercised their overallotment option and purchased an additional 61 million shares for net proceeds to us of 76 million 50 of which was used to ratably repay indebtedness under the senior credit facility as a result of these transactions we recorded a pretax loss on retirement of debt related to unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts of 9 million recorded in “other net” nonoperating income in the fourth quarter of 2010 

 

the restated senior credit facility allows us to refinance indebtedness maturing prior to february 21 2014 but limits our ability to prepay later maturing indebtedness until the extended facilities are paid in full we may issue unsecured debt equitylinked and equity securities to refinance our outstanding indebtedness however we are required to use net proceeds a from indebtedness issued in amounts in excess of 250 million over amounts used to refinance indebtedness and b from equity issued other than in exchange for our indebtedness in amounts in excess of 500 million which limit we reached with our october 2010 stock offering to ratably prepay the credit facilities in each case in an amount equal to 50 of the net cash proceeds of such excess 

 

borgata 

 

in its june 2005 report to the new jersey casino control commission the “ccc” on the application of borgata for renewal of its casino license the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the “dge” stated that it was conducting an investigation of our relationship with our joint venture partner in macau and that the dge would report to the ccc any material information it deemed appropriate 

 

on may 18 2009 the dge issued a report to the ccc on its investigation in the report the dge recommended among other things that i our macau joint venture partner be found to be unsuitable ii we be directed to disengage ourselves from any business association with our macau joint venture partner iii our due diligencecompliance efforts were found to be deficient and iv the ccc hold a hearing to address the report in march 2010 the ccc approved our settlement agreement with the dge pursuant to which we placed our 50 ownership interest in the borgata hotel casino  spa “borgata” and related leased land in atlantic city into a divestiture trust following the transfer of these interests into trust we ceased to be regulated by the ccc or the dge except as otherwise provided by the trust agreement and the settlement agreement boyd gaming corporation “boyd” who owns the other 50 interest is not affected by the settlement 

the terms of the settlement mandate the sale of the trust property within a 30month period ending in september 2012 during the 18 months ending in september 2011 we have the right to direct the trustee to sell the trust property subject to approval of the ccc if a sale is not concluded by that time the trustee is responsible for selling the trust property during the following 12month period prior to the consummation of the sale the divestiture trust will retain any cash flows received in respect of the trust property but will pay property taxes and other costs attributable to the trust property we are the sole economic beneficiary of the trust and will be permitted to reapply for a new jersey gaming license beginning 30 months after the completion of the sale of the trust assets as of december 31 2010 the trust has 188 million of cash and investments of which 150 million is held in treasury securities with maturities greater than 90 days and is recorded within “prepaid expenses and other” 

 

as a result of our ownership interest in borgata being placed into a trust we no longer have significant influence over borgata therefore we discontinued the equity method of accounting for borgata at the point the assets were placed in the trust and account for our rights under the trust agreement under the cost method of accounting we also reclassified the carrying value of our investment related to borgata to “other longterm assets net” earnings and losses that relate to the investment that were previously accrued remain as a part of the carrying amount of the investment distributions received by the trust that do not exceed our share of earnings are recognized currently in earnings however distributions to the trust that exceed our share of earnings for such periods are applied to reduce the carrying amount of our investment the trust received net distributions from the joint venture of 113 million for the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded 94 million as a reduction of the carrying value and 19 million was recorded as “other net” nonoperating income for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

in connection with the settlement agreement discussed above we entered into an amendment to our joint venture agreement with boyd to permit the transfer of our 50 ownership interest into trust in connection with our settlement agreement with the dge in accordance with such agreement boyd received a priority partnership distribution of approximately 31 million equal to the excess prior capital contributions by boyd upon successful refinancing of the borgata credit facility in august 2010 

 

in july 2010 we entered into an agreement to sell four longterm ground leases and their respective underlying real property parcels approximately 11 acres underlying the borgata the transaction closed in november 2010 the trust received net proceeds of 71 million and we recorded a gain of 3 million related to the sale in “property transactions net” 

 

in october 2010 we received an offer for our 50 economic interest in the borgata based on an enterprise value of 135 billion for the entire asset and in october 2010 our board of directors authorized submission of this offer to boyd in accordance with the right of first refusal provisions included in the joint venture agreement subsequently boyd announced that it does not intend to exercise its right of refusal in connection with such offer based on borgata’s september debt balances the offer equated to approximately 250 million for our 50 interest this was less than the carrying value of our investment in borgata therefore we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 128 million at september 30 2010 recorded in “property transactions net” since october 2010 we have continued to negotiate with the prospective purchaser as well as other parties that have expressed interest in the asset there can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed as proposed or at all and the final terms of any sale may differ materially from the ones disclosed above 

 

effect of economic factors on results of operations 

 

the state of the us economy has negatively affected our results of operations over the past several years and we expect to continue to be sensitive to certain aspects of the current economic conditions including for example high unemployment and the weak housing market the decrease in liquidity in the credit markets which began in late 2007 and accelerated in late 2008 also significantly affected our results of operations and financial condition 

 

uncertain economic conditions continue to affect our operating results as businesses and consumers have altered their spending patterns which led to decreases in visitor volumes and customer spending businesses responded to the difficult economic conditions by reducing travel budgets this factor along with negative perceptions surrounding certain types of business travel caused decreases in convention attendance in las vegas in 2009 and 2010 convention and catering customers cancelled or postponed a significant number of events occurring 

during 2009 other conditions currently or recently present in the economic environment which tend to negatively affect our operating results include 

 

  

because of these economic conditions we have increasingly focused on managing costs and continue to review all areas of operations for efficiencies we continually manage staffing levels across all our resorts and have reduced our salaried management positions we suspended company contributions to our 401k plan and our nonqualified deferred compensation plans in 2009 which remained suspended in 2009 and 2010 we reinstated a more limited 401k company contribution in 2011 and will continue to monitor the plan contributions as the economy changes 

 

our results of operations are also affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital – all of which are affected by the uncertain state of the global economy and the continued instability in the capital markets for example we will incur higher interest costs in connection with the amendments to our senior credit facility in 2009 and 2010 also our general cost of debt has increased over the past few years these factors may affect our ability to access future capital and cause future borrowings to carry higher interest rates 

 

impairment charges 

 

investment in borgata as previously noted in october 2010 we received an offer equating to approximately 250 million for our 50 interest in the borgata and our board of directors authorized submission of this offer to boyd gaming corporation who subsequently announced it did not intend to exercise its right of refusal the proposed offer submitted was less than the carrying value of our investment in borgata therefore we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 128 million in the third quarter of 2010 included in “property transactions net” 

 

investment in citycenter at september 30 2009 we reviewed our citycenter investment for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by citycenter management late in the third quarter in addition the impairment charge related to citycenter’s residential real estate under development discussed below further indicated that our investment may have experienced an “otherthantemporary” decline in value our discounted cash flow analysis for citycenter included estimated future cash outflows for construction and maintenance expenditures and future cash inflows from operations including residential sales based on our analysis we determined the carrying value of our investment exceeded its fair value and we determined that the impairment was “otherthantemporary” as a result we recorded an impairment charge of 956 million included in “property transactions net” 

 

at june 30 2010 we reviewed our citycenter investment for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by citycenter management based on current and forecasted market conditions and because citycenter’s results of operations through june 30 2010 were below previous forecasts and the revised operating forecasts were lower than previous forecasts we concluded that we should review the carrying value of our investment we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded our fair value determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and therefore an impairment was indicated we intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment in citycenter however due to the extent of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our investment we determined that the impairment was “otherthantemporary” and recorded an impairment charge of 112 billion included in “property transactions net” 

 

at september 30 2010 we recognized an increase of 232 million in our total net obligation under our citycenter completion guarantee and a corresponding increase in our investment in citycenter the increase primarily reflected a revision to prior estimates based on our assessment of the most current information derived from our closeout and litigation processes and does not reflect certain potential recoveries that citycenter is pursuing as part of the litigation process we completed an impairment review as of september 30 2010 and as a 

result recorded an additional impairment of 191 million in the third quarter of 2010 included in “property transactions net” 

 

the discounted cash flow analyses for our investment in citycenter included estimated future cash inflows from operations including residential sales and estimated future cash outflows for capital expenditures the june 2010 and september 2010 analyses used an 11 discount rate and a long term growth rate of 4 related to forecasted cash flows for citycenter’s operating assets 

 

citycenter residential inventory included in loss from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december 31 2009 is our share of an impairment charge relating to citycenter residential real estate under development “reud” citycenter was required to review its reud for impairment as of september 30 2009 mainly due to citycenter’s september 2009 decision to discount the prices of its residential inventory by 30 this decision and related market conditions led to citycenter management’s conclusion that the carrying value of the reud was not recoverable based on estimates of undiscounted cash flows as a result citycenter was required to compare the fair value of its reud to its carrying value and record an impairment charge for the shortfall fair value of the reud was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s expectations of future cash flows the key inputs in the discounted cash flow analysis included estimated sales prices of units currently under contract and new unit sales the absorption rate over the estimated sellout period and the discount rate this analysis resulted in an impairment charge of approximately 348 million of the reud we recognized our 50 share of such impairment charge adjusted by certain basis differences resulting in a pretax charge of 203 million 

 

due to the completion of construction of the mandarin oriental residential inventory in the first quarter of 2010 and completion of the veer residential inventory in the second quarter of 2010 citycenter is required to carry its residential inventory at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell citycenter determines fair value of its residential inventory using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s current expectations of future cash flows the key inputs in the discounted cash flow analysis include estimated sales prices of units currently under contract and new unit sales the absorption rate over the sellout period and the discount rate these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and are highly sensitive to changes in the market and economic conditions including the estimated absorption period in the event current sales forecasts are not met additional impairment charges may be recognized in future periods 

 

as a result of its impairment analyses of its residential inventory citycenter recorded impairment charges for the mandarin oriental residential inventory of 171 million and 20 million in the first and third quarter of 2010 and impairment charges for the veer residential inventory of 57 million 55 million and 27 million in the second third and fourth quarters of 2010 respectively impairment charges in the third quarter primarily related to an increase in final cost estimates for the residential inventory we recognized our 50 share of such impairment charges resulting in pretax charges of 166 million for the year ended december 31 2010 respectively included in “income loss from unconsolidated affiliates” 

 

citycenter harmon impairment the harmon hotel  spa “harmon” was originally planned to include over 200 residential units and a 400room nongaming lifestyle hotel in 2009 we announced that the opening of the harmon hotel component would be delayed until we and our joint venture partner infinity world mutually agreed to its completion and that the residential component had been canceled 

 

during the third quarter of 2010 citycenter management determined that it is unlikely that the harmon will be completed using the building as it now stands as a result citycenter recorded an impairment charge of 279 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to construction in progress assets the impairment of harmon did not affect our loss from unconsolidated affiliates because we had previously recognized our 50 share of the impairment charge in connection with prior impairments of our investment balance 

 

m resort note at june 30 2009 we reviewed our m resort note for impairment based on our review of the operating results of m resort as well as the m resort’s management’s revised cash flow projections postopening which were significantly lower than original predictions due to market and general economic conditions we determined that the fair value of the m resort note was 0 that the decline in value was “otherthantemporary” and that the entire amount of the indicated impairment related to a credit loss based on these conclusions we 

recorded a pretax impairment of 176 million in the second quarter of 2009 within “other net” of that amount 82 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss which amount was 54 million net of tax we stopped recording accrued “paidinkind” interest as of may 31 2009 and no longer hold this note 

 

 

atlantic city renaissance pointe land we reviewed the carrying value of our renaissance pointe land holdings for impairment at december 31 2009 as we did not intend to pursue development of our mgm grand atlantic city project for the foreseeable future our board of directors subsequently terminated this project our renaissance pointe land holdings included a 72acre development site and included 11 acres of land subject to a longterm lease with the borgata joint venture the fair value of the development land was determined based on a market approach and the fair value of land subject to the longterm lease with borgata was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis using expected contractual cash flows under the lease discounted at a market capitalization rate as a result of our review we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 548 million in the 2009 fourth quarter which was included in “property transactions net” related to our land holdings on renaissance pointe and capitalized development costs 

 

 

goodwill and intangible assets impairment we perform our annual impairment test related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year as a result of our 2008 analysis we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 12 billion the impairment charge related solely to the goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets recognized in the 2005 acquisition of mandalay resort group and represented substantially all of the goodwill recognized at the time of the mandalay acquisition and a minor portion of the value of trade names related to the mandalay resorts the impairment charge resulted from factors affected by economic conditions at the time including 1 lower market valuation multiples for gaming assets 2 higher discount rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity markets and 3 cash flow forecasts for the mandalay resorts no impairment charges were required as a result of our 2010 and 2009 analyses 

 

monte carlo fire 

 

 

we maintain insurance for both property damage and business interruption relating to catastrophic events such as the rooftop fire at monte carlo in january 2008 business interruption coverage covers lost profits and other costs incurred during the closure period and up to six months following reopening 

 

 

we reached final settlement agreements for the monte carlo fire in early 2009 in total we received 74 million of proceeds from our insurance carriers we recognized the 41 million of excess insurance recoveries in income in 2009 and 2008 with recoveries offsetting a writedown of 4 million related to the net book value of damaged assets demolition costs of 7 million and operating costs of 21 million in 2009 15 million and 7 million of such excess insurance recoveries were recognized as offsets to “general and administrative” expense and “property transactions net” respectively in 2008 9 million and 10 million of such excess insurance recoveries were recognized as offsets to “general and administrative” expense and “property transactions net” respectively 

 

key performance indicators 

 

 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities over half of our net revenue is derived from nongaming activities as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including nongaming amenities for which our guests are willing to pay a premium our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization we believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage 

 

 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming segment which can be a cause for variability in our results key performance indicators related to revenue are 

 

 30 

   

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

 

we generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in california we are also exposed to risks related to tourism and the general economy including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events 

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year we market to different customer segments to manage our hotel occupancy such as targeting large conventions to increase midweek occupancy our results do not depend on key individual customers although our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers or the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a particular country or region can affect our results 

 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 certain results in this section are discussed on a “same store” basis excluding the results of ti which was sold in march 2009 

 

the following table summarizes our financial results 

 

 

 

net revenues including reimbursed costs increased 1 from 2009 excluding reimbursed costs net revenues decreased 3 in 2010 and 18 in 2009 largely due to the economic factors discussed in “effect of economic factors on results of operations” as discussed further in “operating results – detailed revenue information” 

revenues have decreased across most lines of business in response to this decrease in revenues we have implemented cost savings efforts to reduce departmental operating expenses but due to our leveraged business model a significant portion of the decline in revenue affected operating results 

 

corporate expense decreased 14 in 2010 primarily as a result of higher legal and advisory costs associated with our activities to improve our financial position in 2009 corporate expense in 2009 increased 32 compared to 2008 due to the legal and advisory costs as well as the accrual of bonus expense in 2009 there was no bonus accrual in 2008 due to not meeting internal profit targets 

 

depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 decreased 8 due to certain assets being fully depreciated depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2009 due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated and the sale of ti in addition other transactions events and impairment charges had a significant impact on our earnings performance the most significant of which are discussed in the “executive overview” section above 

 

operating results – detailed revenue information 

 

the following table presents detail of our net revenues 

 

 

 

table games revenue in 2010 decreased 13 in 2010 on a same store basis mainly as a result of lower overall table games volumes which decreased 6 and lower hold percentage table games revenue in 2009 decreased 11 or 9 on a same store basis due to a decrease in overall table games volume despite an increase of 33 for baccarat volume table games hold percentage was below the midpoint of our normal range in 2010 and near the midpoint for 2009 and 2008 

 

slots revenue decreased 2 in 2010 or 1 on a same store basis as a result of a decrease in volume at our las vegas strip resorts decreases at our las vegas strip resorts were partially offset by a 5 increase in revenue at mgm grand detroit and a 3 increase in revenue at gold strike tunica slots revenue decreased 12 in 2009 or 9 on a same store basis driven by a decrease in volume at our las vegas strip resorts in 2009 most of our las vegas strip resorts experienced decreases in the high single digits while mgm grand detroit and gold strike tunica experienced decreases in the low single digits 

rooms revenue decreased 4 on a same store basis in 2010 and 24 on a same store basis in 2009 as a result of a decrease in occupancy and lower average room rates the following table shows key hotel statistics for our las vegas strip resorts 

 

 

 

food and beverage entertainment and retail revenues in 2010 and 2009 were negatively affected by lower customer spending and decreased occupancy at our resorts in 2009 entertainment revenues benefited from the addition of terry fator at the mirage and the lion king at mandalay bay 

 

reimbursed costs revenue represents reimbursement of costs primarily payrollrelated incurred by us in connection with the provision of management services we recognize costs reimbursed pursuant to management services as revenue in the period we incur the costs reimbursed costs which are related mainly to our management of citycenter were 359 million 99 million and 47 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively

preopening and startup expenses consisted of the following 

 

 

property transactions net consisted of the following 

 

 

 

see discussion of our impairment charges under “executive overview” other property transactions during 2010 related primarily to writedowns of various discontinued capital projects other property transactions in 2009 primarily related to writedowns of various discontinued capital projects and offset by 7 million in insurance recoveries related to the monte carlo fire other property transactions in 2008 included 30 million related to the writedown of land and building assets of primm valley golf club the 2008 period also included approximately 9 million of demolition costs associated with various room remodel projects as well as the writedown of approximately 27 million of various discontinued capital projects these amounts were offset by a gain on the sale of an aircraft of 25 million and 10 million of insurance recoveries related to the monte carlo fire 

 

operating results – income loss from unconsolidated affiliates 

 

the following table summarizes information related to our income loss from unconsolidated affiliates 

 

 

 

operating results for citycenter included 166 million and 203 million of residential real estate impairments in 2010 and 2009 respectively as a result of the transfer of borgata assets into trust in 2010 we no longer record borgata income in income from unconsolidated affiliates the 2009 results also included a 12 million charge related to development costs for our postponed joint venture project on the north las vegas strip and 14 million related to insurance proceeds recognized at borgata 

nonoperating results 

 

the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt 

 

 

 

in 2010 gross interest costs increased due to higher interest rates on our senior credit facility and newly issued fixed rate borrowings included in interest expense in 2010 is 31 million of amortization of debt discount associated with the amendment of our senior credit facility during 2010 in 2009 gross interest costs increased compared to 2008 mainly due to higher average debt balances during 2009 higher interest rates for borrowings under our senior credit facility in 2009 higher interest rates for newly issued fixed rate borrowings as well as breakage fees for voluntary repayments of our revolving credit facility 

 

we did not have any capitalized interest in 2010 as we ceased capitalization of interest related to citycenter in december 2009 and we have no other qualifying capital projects ongoing capitalized interest increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher citycenter investment balances and higher weighted average cost of debt the amounts presented above exclude noncash gross interest and corresponding capitalized interest for 2008 and 2009 related to our citycenter delayed equity contribution 

 

the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 

 

 

the income tax benefit on pretax loss in 2010 was provided essentially at the federal statutory rate of 35 the income tax benefit provided on pretax loss in 2009 was greater than 35 primarily as a result of state tax benefit provided on the writedown of land in atlantic city the writedown of goodwill in 2008 which was treated as a permanently nondeductible item in our federal income tax provision caused us to incur a provision for income tax expense in 2008 even though our pretax result was a loss for that year excluding the effect of the goodwill writedown the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2008 was 373 

 

the net refund of cash taxes in 2010 was due primarily to the carryback to prior years of us federal income tax net operating losses incurred in 2009 the net refund of cash taxes in 2009 was due primarily to refunds of taxes that were paid in 2008 cash taxes were paid in 2008 despite the pretax operating loss due to the nondeductible goodwill writedown and cash taxes paid on the gain from the citycenter joint venture transaction that occurred in 2007 since the citycenter gain was realized in the fourth quarter of 2007 the associated income taxes were paid in 2008 

 

nongaap measures 

 

“adjusted ebitda” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses and property transactions net “adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense adjusted ebitda and adjusted 

property ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because we believe that these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies 

 

we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and dependent on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects “property transactions net” includes normal recurring disposals and gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of our operating resorts’ performance 

 

adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda in a different manner 

 

the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss 

 

 

 

on a same store basis adjusted ebitda decreased 15 in 2010 excluding the 166 million impact from the residential real estate impairment charges at citycenter and 58 million of forfeited residential deposits at citycenter in 2010 and a 203 million impairment charge related to citycenter real estate under development 15 million of monte carlo insurance recoveries and 12 million of impairment related to our proposed north las vegas strip joint venture project in 2009 adjusted ebitda decreased 20 adjusted ebitda on a same store basis decreased 38 in 2009 mainly as a result of the factors previously discussed in “operating results – detailed revenue information” excluding the real estate under development impairment north las vegas strip impairment and monte carlo insurance recoveries adjusted ebitda decreased 27 in 2009 

on a same store basis adjusted property ebitda from whollyowned operations decreased to 12 billion in 2010 from 13 billion in 2009 as a result of previously discussed operating trends adjusted property ebitda from whollyowned operations decreased 26 in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

the following tables present reconciliations of operating income loss to adjusted property ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows – summary 

 

our cash flows consisted of the following 

 

 

 

cash flows – operating activities 

 

trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income excluding noncash charges but can be affected by the timing of significant tax payments or refunds and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates cash flow from operating activities decreased 14 in 2010 due to a decrease in operating income excluding noncash charges partially offset by net tax refunds of 330 million during 2010 cash flow from operating activities decreased 22 in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in operating income and the sale of ti operating cash flows also decreased due to a 47 million increase in our receivable from citycenter partially offset by increased distributions from unconsolidated affiliates the 2008 period also included a significant tax payment approximately 300 million relating to the 2007 citycenter joint venture transaction 

 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 we held cash and cash equivalents of 499 million and 21 billion respectively on december 30 2009 we borrowed the remaining availability of 16 billion under our senior credit facility and repaid such borrowings immediately after year end 

we require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts beyond our cash on hand we utilize companywide cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held in banks funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central bank accounts and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our bank credit facilities

investments in unconsolidated affiliates our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter grand victoria silver legacy and mgm macau we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we have not historically guaranteed financing obtained by our investees and there are no other provisions of the venture agreements which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort 

 

citycenter completion guarantee we entered into an unlimited completion and cost overrun guarantee with respect to citycenter secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land the terms of the completion guarantee provide that up to 250 million of net residential proceeds from the sale of condominium properties at citycenter would be permitted by citycenter’s lenders and our joint venture partner to fund construction costs that we will otherwise be obligated to pay under the completion guarantee or to reimburse us for construction costs previously expended however the timing of receipt of such proceeds is uncertain 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had funded 553 million under the completion guarantee we have recorded a receivable from citycenter of 124 million related to these amounts which represents amounts reimbursable to us from citycenter from future residential proceeds at december 31 2010 our remaining estimated net obligation under the completion guarantee was approximately 80 million which includes estimated litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes with contractors as to the final construction costs and reflects certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the contractors citycenter has reached or expects to reach settlement agreements with most of these construction subcontractors however significant disputes remain with the general contractor and certain subcontractors amounts claimed by such parties exceed amounts included in our completion guarantee accrual by approximately 200 million moreover we have not accrued for any contingent payments to citycenter related to the harmon hotel  spa component which is unlikely to be completed using the building as it now stands we do not believe we would be responsible for funding any additional remediation efforts that might be required with respect to the harmon however our view is based on a number of developing factors including with respect to ongoing litigation with citycenter’s contractors actions by local officials and other developments related to the citycenter venture that are subject to change see “legal proceedings” for the discussion of perini litigation 

in january 2011 we entered into an amended completion and cost overrun guarantee in connection with citycenter’s restated senior credit facility agreement and issuance of 15 billion of senior secured first lien notes and senior secured second lien notes consistent with the previous completion guarantee the terms of the amended completion guarantee provide for the application of an additional 124 million of net residential proceeds from sales of condominium properties at citycenter to fund construction costs or to reimburse us for construction costs previously expended however the timing of receipt of such proceeds is uncertain 

 

letters of credit at december 31 2010 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 37 million 

 

commitments and contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

  

see “executive overview” for discussion of our liquidity and financial position and ability to meet known obligations 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states at december 31 2010 and 2009 approximately 36 and 40 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2010 and 2009 approximately 51 and 46 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east 

 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 

 

the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables 

 

 

 

the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has increased in the current year due to a larger percentage of receivables over 180 days at december 31 2010 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by 2 million or less than 001 per share 

 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

 

property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost has been determined based on estimated fair values in connection with the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project 

using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as a held for sale or b to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset typically measured using a discounted cash flow model if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses 

 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results negative industry or economic factors or significant changes to our operating environment we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets when appropriate we discount future cash flows using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry 

 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates as of the date we completed our 2010 goodwill impairment analysis the estimated fair values of our reporting units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method 

 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the 

determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

 

see “executive overview” and “results of operations” for discussion of writedowns and impairments of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets other than mentioned therein we are not aware of events or circumstances through december 31 2010 that would cause us to review any material longlived assets goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

 

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an “otherthantemporary” decline in value if such conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is “otherthantemporary” based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates see “executive overview” for discussion of impairment charges recorded in 2010 and 2009 related to our investment in citycenter 

 

income taxes 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied except for certain state deferred tax assets and a foreign tax credit carryforward we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences given the negative impact of the us economy on the results of our operations in the past several years and our expectations that we will continue to be adversely affected by certain aspects of the current economic conditions we no longer rely on future operating income in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets and now rely only on the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences accordingly we concluded during 2010 that realization of certain of our state deferred tax assets was no longer more likely than not and we provided a valuation allowance in the amount of 32 million net of federal effect with a corresponding reduction in income tax benefit since the future reversal of existing us federal taxable temporary differences currently exceed the future reversal of existing us federal deductible temporary differences we continue to conclude that it is more likely than not that our us federal deferred tax assets other than the foreign tax credit carryforward are realizable should we continue to experience operating losses of the same magnitude we have experienced in the past several years it is reasonably possible in the near term that the future reversal of our us federal deductible temporary differences could exceed the future reversal of our us federal taxable temporary differences in which case we would record a valuation allowance for such excess with a corresponding reduction of federal income tax benefit on our statement of operations 

 

our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities 

 

we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized we review uncertain tax positions at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current “other accrued liabilities” or longterm “other longterm liabilities” based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material 

 

as of december 31 2010 we were no longer subject to examination of our us consolidated federal income 

tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2005 the irs completed its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years during 2010 and we paid 12 million in tax and 4 million in associated interest with respect to adjustments to which we agreed in addition we submitted a protest to irs appeals of certain adjustments to which we do not agree the opening appeals conference has been scheduled to occur in the first quarter of 2011 it is reasonably possible that the issues subject to appeal may be settled within the next 12 months during the fourth quarter of 2010 the irs opened an examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years 

 

the irs informed us during the fourth quarter of 2010 that they would initiate an audit of the 2007 through 2009 tax years of citycenter holdings llc an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the irs also informed us that they would initiate an audit of the 2008 through 2009 tax years of mgm grand detroit llc a subsidiary treated as a partnership for income tax purposes neither of these audits was initiated in 2010 but we anticipate that both will be initiated in early 2011 

 

we reached settlement during 2010 with irs appeals with respect to the audit of the 2004 through 2006 tax years of mgm grand detroit llc at issue was the tax treatment of payments made under an agreement to develop own and operate a hotel casino in the city of detroit we will owe 1 million in tax as a result of this settlement 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 a tentative settlement was reached with irs appeals with respect to the audit of the 2003 and 2004 tax years of a cost method investee of ours that is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes the adjustments to which we agreed in such settlement will be included in any settlement that we may reach with respect to the 2003 and 2004 examination of our consolidated federal income tax return 

 

the irs closed during 2010 its examination of the federal income tax return of mandalay resort group for the preacquisition year ended april 25 2005 and issued a “nochange letter” the statutes of limitations for assessing tax for all mandalay resort group preacquisition years are now closed 

 

as of december 31 2010 other than the exceptions noted below we were no longer subject to examination of our various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2006 the state of illinois during 2010 initiated an audit of our illinois combined returns for the 2006 and 2007 tax years it is reasonably possible that this audit will close and all issues will be settled in the next 12 months the state of new jersey began audit procedures during 2010 of a cost method investee of ours for the 2003 through 2006 tax years the city of detroit previously indicated that it would audit a mandalay resort group subsidiary return for the preacquisition year ended april 25 but no audit was initiated and the statute of limitations for assessing tax expired in 2010 no other state or local income tax returns of ours are currently under exam 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted stock units compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model our volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year in 2010 we granted 38 million sars with a total fair value of 27 million in 2009 we granted 68 million sars with a total fair value of 37 million in 2008 we granted 49 million sars with a total fair value of 72 million 

 

for 2010 awards a 10 change in the volatility assumption 71 for 2010 for sensitivity analysis volatility was assumed to be 64 and 78 would have resulted in a 2 million or 8 change in fair value a 10 change in the expected term assumption 48 years for 2010 for sensitivity analysis expected term was assumed to be 43 years and 53 years would have resulted in a 1 million or 4 change in fair value these changes in fair value would have been recognized over the four to fiveyear vesting period of such awards it should be noted that a change in the expected term would cause other changes since the riskfree rate and volatility assumptions are specific to the term we did not attempt to adjust those assumptions in performing the sensitivity analysis above 

recently issued accounting standards 

 

certain amendments to accounting standards codification “asc” topic 810 “consolidation” became effective for us beginning january 1 2010 such amendments include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity “vie” an enterprise must determine if its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie by evaluating whether 1 the enterprise has the power to direct activities of the vie that have a significant effect on economic performance and 2 the enterprise has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the amendments to asc 810 also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie the adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

market risk 

 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures 

 

as of december 31 2010 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 19 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor over the 2 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 23 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2010 the following table provides additional information about our gross longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates

overview 

 

mgm mirage is one of the world’s leading and most respected companies with significant holdings in gaming hospitality and entertainment we believe the resorts we own manage and invest in are among the world’s finest casino resorts mgm mirage is a delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding company our operations are conducted through our whollyowned subsidiaries 

 

our strategy is to generate sustainable profitable growth by creating and maintaining competitive advantages and through the execution of our business plan which is focused on 

 

  

resort portfolio 

 

we execute our strategy through a portfolio approach seeking to ensure that we own invest in and manage resorts that are superior to our competitors’ resorts in the markets in which our resorts are located and across our customer base our customer base is discussed below under “resort operation” 

 

we selectively acquire invest in and develop resorts in markets with a stable regulatory history and environment as seen in the table below this means that a large portion of our resorts are located in nevada we target markets with growth potential and we believe there is growth potential in investing in and managing both gaming and nongaming resorts our growth strategies are discussed in greater detail below under “sustainable growth and leveraging our brand and management assets” 

 

our operating resorts 

 

we have provided below certain information about our resorts as of december 31 2009 except as otherwise indicated we wholly own and operate the resorts shown below 

 

 1 

 

 

 

  

more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 

 

portfolio strategy 

 

we believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires targeted capital investments that promote our goal to create the greatest possible experiences for our guests we have historically made significant investments in our resorts through the addition of new restaurants entertainment and nightlife offerings and other new features and amenities in addition we have made regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our hotel rooms and public spaces the quality of our resorts can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards such as several four and five diamond designations from the american automobile association and four and five star designations from mobil travel 

 

we also actively manage our portfolio of land holdings we own approximately 670 acres of land on the las vegas strip with a meaningful portion of those acres undeveloped acreage or acreage we consider to be underdeveloped 

 

risks associated with our portfolio strategy 

 

certain principal risk factors relating to our current portfolio of resorts are 

 

  

see “item 1a risk factors” below for a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors 

resort operation 

 

our operating philosophy is to create resorts of memorable character treat our employees well and provide superior service for our guests we also seek to develop competitive advantages in specific markets and among specific customer groups 

 

general 

 

we primarily own and operate casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities over half of our net revenue is derived from nongaming activities a higher percentage than many of our competitors as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including high quality nongaming amenities for which our guests are willing to pay a premium 

 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities since we believe that the number of walkin customers affects the success of our casino resorts we design our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other hotels we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming segment which can be a cause of variability in our results 

 

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year our significant convention and meeting facilities typically allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our results do not depend on key individual customers although our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers or the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a particular country or region can affect our results 

 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our whollyowned resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we generally have an operating philosophy that favors ownership and management of amenities since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience however we do lease space to retail and food and beverage operators in certain situations particularly for branding opportunities and where capital investment by us is not feasible we also operate many “managed” outlets utilizing thirdparty management for specific expertise in areas such as restaurants and nightclubs as well as for branding opportunities 

 

customers and competition 

 

our casino resorts generally operate in highly competitive environments we compete against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality and leisure and business travel companies our primary methods of competing successfully include 

 

 3 

 

  

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotelcasinos in the las vegas area including major hotelcasinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotelcasinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major hotelcasinos elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 149000 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2009 up 6 from approximately 141000 rooms at december 31 2008 at december 31 2009 we operated approximately 28 of the guestrooms in las vegas las vegas visitor volume was 364 million in 2009 a decrease of 3 from the 375 million reported for 2008 

 

the principal segments of the las vegas gaming market are leisure travel premium gaming customers conventions including small meetings trade associations and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel our highend whollyowned properties which include bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome customers largely from the leisure travel and to a lesser extent the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments 

 

outside las vegas our other whollyowned nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and larger operations our nevada resorts not located in las vegas appeal primarily to the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer a significant portion of our customers at these resorts come from california we believe the expansion of native american gaming in california has had a negative impact on all of our nevada resorts not located on the las vegas strip and additional expansion in california could have a further adverse effect on these resorts 

 

outside nevada our whollyowned resorts primarily compete for customers in local and regional gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success for instance in tunica mississippi one of our competitors is closer to memphis the area’s principal market in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for instance in detroit michigan we also compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we also compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi and with casinos in florida and the bahamas 

 

aria at citycenter appeals to the upper end of each market segment our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets much like our whollyowned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts aria which we manage and own 50 of through a joint venture also competes against our whollyowned resorts 

 

our casino resorts also compete for customers with hotelcasino operations located in other areas of the united states and other parts of the world and for leisure and business travelers with nongaming tourist destinations such as hawaii florida and cruise ships our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states 

 

marketing 

 

we advertise on radio television and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as on the internet and by direct mail we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major us and foreign cities a key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention 

segment we maintain internet websites to inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets we also operate call centers to allow customer contact by phone to make hotel and restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets 

 

we utilize our worldclass golf courses in marketing programs at our las vegas strip resorts our major las vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at shadow creek in north las vegas in connection with our marketing activities we also invite our premium gaming customers to play shadow creek on a complimentary basis we also use primm valley golf club for marketing purposes at our las vegas strip resorts additionally marketing efforts at beau rivage benefit from fallen oak golf course just 20 minutes north of beau rivage 

 

employees and management 

 

we believe that knowledgeable friendly and dedicated employees are a key success factor in the casino resort industry therefore we invest heavily in recruiting training and retaining our employees as well as seeking to hire and promote the strongest management team possible we have numerous programs both at the corporate and business unit level designed to achieve these objectives for example our diversity initiative extends throughout our company and focuses on the unique strengths of our individuals combined with a culture of working together to achieve greater performance our diversity program has been widely recognized and has received numerous awards we believe our development programs such as the mgm grand university and various leadership and management training programs are bestinclass among our industry peers 

 

technology 

 

we utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations our players club program links our major resorts and consolidates all slots and table games activity for customers with a players club account customers qualify for benefits across all of the participating resorts regardless of where they play we believe that our players club enables us to more effectively market to our customers 

 

we utilize serverbased slot machine technology at aria which gives us the ability to present players club data and other property marketing directly to the customer in addition serverbased gaming allows us to quickly convert the games offered on machines on the casino floor to meet customer requests and gives us the ability to dynamically change machine wagering allowing us to maximize our profits based on demand 

 

technology is an important part of our strategy in nongaming and administrative operations our hotel systems include yield management software programs which allow us to maximize occupancy and room rates additionally these systems capture charges made by our customers during their stay including allowing customers of our resorts to charge meals and services at our other resorts to their hotel accounts 

 

internal controls 

 

we have a strong culture of compliance driven by our history in the highly regulated gaming industry and our belief that compliance is a valueadded activity our system of internal controls and procedures — including internal control over financial reporting — is designed to ensure reliable and accurate financial records transparent disclosures compliance with laws and regulations and protection of our assets our internal controls start at the source of business transactions and we have rigorous enforcement at both the business unit and corporate level 

 

our corporate management also reviews each of our businesses on a regular basis and we have a corporate internal audit function that performs reviews regarding gaming compliance internal controls over financial reporting and operations 

 

in addition we maintain a compliance committee that administers our companywide compliance plan the compliance plan is in place to ensure compliance with gaming and other laws applicable to our operations in all jurisdictions including performing background investigations on our current and potential employees directors and vendors as well as thorough review of proposed transactions and associations 

in connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements and other activities including cash transaction reporting which is essential in our industry our controls surrounding cash transactions include locked cash boxes on the casino floor daily cash counts performed by employees who are independent of casino operations constant observation and supervision of the gaming area observation and recording of gaming and other areas by closedcircuit television constant computer monitoring of our slot machines and timely analysis of deviations from expected performance 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at aria bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at certain of those casinos as well we also maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to timely pay their marker balances these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices direct personal contact and the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation 

 

in nevada mississippi michigan new jersey and illinois amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are enforceable under state laws all other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts owed for markers entered into in nevada mississippi new jersey illinois or michigan which are not timely paid pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries but the us assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states 

 

risks associated with our operating strategy 

 

certain principal risk factors relating to our operating strategy are 

 

  

see “item 1a risk factors” below for a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors 

 

sustainable growth and leveraging our brand and management assets 

 

in allocating resources our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts spending on new resorts or initiatives repaying longterm debt and returning capital to shareholders historically we have actively allocated capital to each of these areas we believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives that will provide returns in excess of the other options although these decisions have been significantly affected by the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 which limited our access to capital at prices low enough to finance all of our new initiatives 

 

we regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the domestic and international markets but cannot at this time determine the likelihood of proceeding with specific development opportunities opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in nevada or in states other than nevada or outside of the united states we may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties due to the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 we postponed certain development projects including a resort complex on our 72acre site in atlantic city and an integrated resort to be located on the southwest corner of las vegas boulevard and sahara avenue with kerzner international and istithmar we do not expect to move forward with these projects until general economic 

conditions market conditions and our financial position improve and in the case of the atlantic city development we do not intend to pursue this development for the foreseeable future — see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of the related impairment charge 

 

we also seek to leverage our management expertise and wellrecognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities we feel that several of our brands particularly the “mgm grand” “bellagio” and “skylofts” brands are well suited to new projects in both gaming and nongaming developments we formed mgm mirage hospitality llc “hospitality” which includes mgm mirage global gaming development principally focused on international gaming expansion the purpose of hospitality is to source strategic resort development and management opportunities both gaming and nongaming focusing on international opportunities which we believe offer the greatest opportunity for future growth we have hired senior personnel with established backgrounds in the development and management of international hospitality operations to maximize the profit potential of hospitality’s operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows in evaluating us you should consider carefully among other things the risks described below 

 

risks related to our substantial indebtedness 

 

  

 11 

moreover our businesses are capital intensive for our owned and managed properties to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties wellmaintained modernized and refurbished which requires an ongoing supply of cash and to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained similarly future development projects and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments the incurrence of additional debt guarantees of thirdparty debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations events over the past two years including the failures and near failures of financial services companies and the decrease in liquidity and available capital have negatively affected the capital markets 

 

  

we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2010 and 2011 our ability to timely refinance and replace such indebtedness will depend upon the foregoing as well as on continued and sustained improvements in financial markets if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us if at all on satisfactory terms on terms that would not be disadvantageous to note holders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements 

 

  

  

our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our longterm indebtedness any default under the senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth our financial condition our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and could force us to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws 

risks related to our business 

 

  

as a result of the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the “dge” investigation of our relationship with our joint venture partner in macau we are currently involved in constructive settlement discussions with the dge under which we would agree to sell our 50 ownership interest in borgata and related leased land in atlantic city if we are unable to effectuate such a settlement with the dge we may still be subject to action by the new jersey casino control commission related to the dge’s report — see “item 3 legal proceedings” 

 

 13 

 

a recession economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts which would adversely affect our operating results for example the recent recession and downturn in consumer and corporate spending has had a negative impact on our results of operations in addition the weak housing and real estate market— both generally and in nevada particularly — has negatively impacted citycenter’s ability to sell residential units 

 

 14 

  

for instance if citycenter 50 owned and managed by us is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our partners are unable to support future funding requirements as necessary or if citycenter’s 18 billion senior secured credit facility is terminated for any reason such event could have adverse financial consequences to us such credit facility includes provisions limiting the amount of permitted construction liens and also includes leverage and interest coverage covenants which will go into effect during 2011 in accordance with our joint venture agreement and the citycenter credit facility we provided a cost overrun guarantee which is secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land in addition the operation of a joint venture is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters 

 

also the operation of mgm grand macau 50 owned by us is subject to unique risks including risks related to a macau’s regulatory framework b our ability to adapt to the different regulatory and gaming environment in macau while remaining in compliance with the requirements of the gaming regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate as well as other applicable federal state or local laws in the united states and macau c potential political or economic instability and d the extreme weather conditions in the region 

 

furthermore such operations in macau or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories are subject to risk pertaining to international operations these may include financial risks such as foreign economy adverse tax consequences and inability to adequately enforce our rights these may also include regulatory and political risks such as foreign government regulations general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability hostilities with neighboring counties and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 

 

 15 

  

in addition tracinda may be able to exercise significant influence over mgm mirage as a result of its significant ownership of our outstanding common stock as a result actions requiring stockholder approval that may be supported by other stockholders could be effectively blocked by tracinda corporation

new jersey regulatory review of macau investment 

 

in its june 2005 report to the new jersey casino control commission the “new jersey commission” on the application of borgata for renewal of its casino license the dge stated that it was conducting an investigation of our relationship with our joint venture partner in macau and that the dge would report to the new jersey commission any material information it deemed appropriate 

 

on may 18 2009 the new jersey division of gaming enforcement “dge” issued a report to the new jersey commission on its investigation in the report the dge recommended among other things that i our macau joint venture partner be found to be unsuitable ii we be directed to disengage ourselves from any business association with our macau joint venture partner iii our due diligencecompliance efforts be found to be deficient and iv the new jersey commission hold a hearing to address the report 

the dge is responsible for investigating licensees and prosecuting matters before the new jersey commission however the report is merely a recommendation and is not binding on the new jersey commission which has sole responsibility and authority for deciding all regulatory and licensing matters the new jersey commission has not yet taken any action with respect to the report but on july 27 2009 the dge submitted a letter to the new jersey commission recommending that the new jersey commission reopen the licensing of borgata to address the ongoing suitability of the company as a licensee under new jersey regulations the new jersey commission is obligated to reopen the licensing this was a procedural step required by the new jersey casino control act that does not represent a finding as to the issues raised by the dge the company will have the opportunity to respond to the dge report in an open public proceeding 

 

we are currently involved in constructive settlement discussions with the dge which have centered on us placing our 50 ownership interest in the borgata hotel casino  spa and related leased land in atlantic city into a divestiture trust for which we would be the sole economic beneficiary any settlement is subject to both dge and new jersey commission approval

as of december 31 2009 our financial obligations in 2010 included 11 billion related to maturities of longterm debt 10 billion in estimated interest payments on outstanding debt and an estimated 394 million under our citycenter completion guarantee which we expect to be partially offset by up to 244 million in proceeds from the sale of residential units at citycenter though the timing of receipt of such proceeds is uncertain in addition we expect to invest approximately 250 million in currently uncommitted capital expenditures at our resorts in 2010 

 

giving effect to the january 4 2010 repayment we had approximately 16 billion available under our senior credit facility to fund our 2010 obligations as of december 31 2009 we have no other existing sources of borrowing availability except to the extent we reduce amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility in addition we historically have generated significant cash flows from operations we generated approximately 14 billion in cash flows from operations before deducting cash paid for interest in 2009 we also expect to receive tax refunds of approximately 385 million during 2010 

 

on february 25 2010 we entered into an amendment the “amendment” to our senior credit facility which 

 

  

pursuant to the amendment a restatement of our senior credit facility the “restated loan agreement” will become effective upon making of the required prepayments and satisfaction of certain documentary conditions provided that these occur no later than june 30 2010 

 

the restated loan agreement

in addition the restated loan agreement will allow us to issue unsecured debt and equity securities to refinance indebtedness maturing prior to october 3 2011 and the 12 billion portion of the obligations owed to nonextending lenders following the repayment of such lenders and the fulfillment of certain other conditions the maturity of the balance of the senior credit facility will be extended to february 21 2014 and the restated loan agreement will thereafter permit us to issue unsecured debt and equity securities to refinance indebtedness which matures prior to the maturity date of the extended facilities however a indebtedness in amounts issued in excess of 250 million over such interim maturities requires ratable prepayment of the credit facilities in an amount equal to 50 of the net cash proceeds of such excess and b equity amounts issued in excess of 500 million over such interim maturities require ratable prepayment of the credit facilities in an amount equal to 50 of the net cash proceeds of such excess 

 

current operations 

 

at december 31 2009 our operations consisted of 15 whollyowned casino resorts and 50 investments in five other casino resorts including 

 

 

 

other operations include the shadow creek golf course in north las vegas and fallen oak golf course in saucier mississippi we also own the primm valley golf club at the california state line which is currently operated by a third party in december 2008 we entered into an agreement to sell ti the sale closed in march 2009 

 

citycenter the other 50 of citycenter is owned by infinity world development corp “infinity world” a whollyowned subsidiary of dubai world a dubai united arab emirates government decree entity citycenter consists of aria a 4000room casino resort mandarin oriental las vegas a 400room nongaming boutique hotel crystals a 425000 square foot retail district including shops dining and entertainment venues and vdara a 1495room luxury condominiumhotel in addition citycenter features residential units in the residences at mandarin oriental — 225 units and veer — approximately 670 units aria opened on december 16 2009 and vdara mandarin oriental and crystals all opened in early december 2009 the residential units within citycenter began the sales closing process in early 2010 additionally citycenter postponed the opening of the harmon hotel  spa a 400room nongaming boutique hotel until such time as we and infinity world mutually agree to proceed with its completion we receive a management fee of 2 of gross revenues for the management of aria and vdara and 5 of ebitda as defined in addition we receive an annual fee of 3 million for the management of crystals 

 

borgata in may 2009 the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the “dge” issued a report which recommended to the new jersey casino control commission the “new jersey commission that among other things our macau joint venture partner be found to be unsuitable and we be directed to disengage from any business association with such macau joint venture partner we are currently involved in constructive settlement discussions 

with the dge which have centered on us placing our 50 ownership interest in the borgata hotel casino  spa and related leased land in atlantic city into a divestiture trust the “trust” for which we would be the sole economic beneficiary any settlement is subject to both dge and new jersey commission approval 

 

in february 2010 we entered into an amendment to our joint venture agreement with boyd gaming corporation “boyd” to permit the transfer of our 50 ownership interest into the trust in connection with our potential settlement agreement with the dge the amendment also includes the following provisions that would become effective only upon the transfer of the joint venture interests into trust boyd would receive a priority partnership distribution of approximately 31 million equal to the excess prior capital contributions by boyd upon successful refinancing of the borgata credit facility in addition boyd would receive a payment from the trust equal to the greater of 10 million or 3 of the proceeds from the sale of our 50 interest in borgata 

 

if we reach a settlement agreement with the dge we will discontinue the equity method of accounting for borgata at the point the assets are placed in the trust and will account for our rights under the trust arrangement under the cost method of accounting earnings and losses that relate to the investment that were previously accrued will remain as a part of the carrying amount of the investment distributions received by the trust in subsequent periods that do not exceed our share of earnings will be recognized currently in earnings however distributions to the trust in subsequent periods that exceed our share of earnings for such periods will be applied to reduce the carrying amount of our investment 

 

key performance indicators 

 

our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities over half of our net revenue is derived from nongaming activities a higher percentage than many of our competitors as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including nongaming amenities for which our guests are willing to pay a premium our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization we believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage 

 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming segment which can be a cause for variability in our results key performance indicators related to revenue are 

 

  

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

 

we generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks outside of our control such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and from the expansion of gaming in california we are also exposed to risks related to tourism and the general economy including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year we market to different customer segments to manage our hotel occupancy such as targeting large conventions to ensure midweek occupancy our results do not depend on key individual customers although our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers or the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a particular country or region can affect our results 

 

impact of economic conditions and credit markets on our results of operations 

 

the state of the us economy has negatively affected our results of operations since 2008 and we expect to continue to be affected by certain aspects of the current economic conditions — high unemployment and weak housing market for example — into 2010 the decrease in liquidity in the credit markets which began in late 2007 and accelerated in late 2008 also significantly affected our results of operations and financial condition 

 

uncertain economic conditions continue to affect our customers’ spending levels travel and travelrelated expenditures have been particularly affected as businesses and consumers have altered their spending patterns which has led to decreases in visitor volumes and customer spending businesses responded to the difficult economic conditions by reducing travel budgets this factor along with perceptions surrounding certain types of business travel negatively affected convention attendance in las vegas in 2009 convention and catering customers cancelled or postponed a significant number of events occurring during 2008 2009 and early 2010 other conditions currently or recently present in the economic environment which tend to negatively affect our operating results include 

 

  

because of these economic conditions we have increasingly focused on managing costs and continue to review all areas of operations for efficiencies we continually manage staffing levels across all our resorts and have reduced our salaried management positions as a result the average number of fulltime equivalents at our resorts for the year ended december 31 2009 was 11 lower than 2008 which was 8 lower than 2007 

 

in addition we did not pay discretionary bonuses for 2008 due to not meeting our internal profit targets we suspended company contributions to our 401k plan and our nonqualified deferred compensation plans in 2009 we rescinded cost of living increases for nonunion employees in 2009 and we reached an agreement with our primary union to defer the 2009 contractual pay increase we paid discretionary bonuses for 2009 in february 2010 and we will provide general salary increases to certain salaried employees in 2010 however company matching contributions to our 401k plan and our nonqualified deferred compensation plans will remain frozen until such time as we believe it is prudent to reinstate these benefits 

 

our results of operations are also affected by decisions we made related to our capital allocation our access to capital and our cost of capital — all of which are affected by the uncertain state of the global economy and the continued instability in the capital markets for example

impairment charges 

 

atlantic city renaissance pointe land we reviewed the carrying value of our renaissance pointe land holdings for impairment at december 31 2009 as we do not intend to pursue development of our mgm grand atlantic city project for the foreseeable future our renaissance pointe land holdings include a 72acre development site and 10 acres of land subject to a longterm lease with the borgata joint venture the fair value of the development land was determined based on a market approach and the fair value of land subject to the longterm lease with borgata was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis using expected contractual cash flows under the lease discounted at a market capitalization rate as a result we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 548 million in the 2009 fourth quarter which was included in “property transactions net” related to our land holdings on renaissance pointe and capitalized development costs 

 

citycenter at september 30 2009 we reviewed our citycenter investment for impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by citycenter management late in the third quarter of 2009 in addition the impairment charge related to citycenter’s residential real estate under development discussed below further indicated that our investment may have experienced an “otherthantemporary” decline in value our discounted cash flow analysis for citycenter included estimated future cash outflows for construction and maintenance expenditures and future cash inflows from operations including residential sales based on our analysis we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded its fair value and therefore an impairment was indicated we intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment in citycenter however due to the extent of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our investment we determined that the impairment was “otherthantemporary” and recorded an impairment charge of 956 million included in “property transactions net” 

 

in addition included in “income loss from unconsolidated affiliates” is our share of an impairment charge relating to citycenter residential real estate under development “reud” citycenter was required to review its reud for impairment at september 30 2009 mainly due to citycenter’s september 2009 decision to discount the prices of its residential inventory by 30 this decision and related market conditions led to citycenter management’s conclusion that the carrying value of the reud is not recoverable based on estimates of undiscounted cash flows as a result citycenter was required to compare the fair value of its reud to its carrying value and record an impairment charge in the third quarter of 2009 for the shortfall fair value of the reud was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s current expectations of future cash flows the key inputs in the discounted cash flow analysis included estimated sales prices of units currently under contract and new unit sales the absorption rate over the sellout period and the discount rate this analysis resulted in an impairment charge of approximately 348 million of the reud we recognized 50 of such impairment charge adjusted by certain basis differences resulting in a pretax charge of 203 million once the residential inventory is complete in the first quarter of 2010 citycenter will be required to measure such inventory at the lower of a its carrying value or b fair value less costs to sell it is reasonably possible that the fair value less cost to sell of the residential inventory at completion will be below the inventory’s carrying value and that the joint venture will be required to record an additional impairment charge at that time we would record 50 of any such impairment charge adjusted for certain basis differences 

 

m resort note at june 30 2009 we reviewed our m resort note for impairment based on our review of the operating results of m resort as well as the m resort’s management’s revised cash flow projections postopening which were significantly lower than original predictions due to market and general economic conditions we determined that the fair value of the m resort note was 0 that the decline in value was “otherthantemporary” and that the entire amount of the indicated impairment related to a credit loss based on these conclusions we recorded a pretax impairment of 176 million in the second quarter of 2009 within “other nonoperating expense” 

2008 goodwill impairment we perform our annual impairment test related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year no impairment charges were recorded as a result of our 2009 analysis as a result of our 2008 analysis we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 12 billion the impairment charge related solely to the goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets recognized in the 2005 acquisition of mandalay resort group and represented substantially all of the goodwill recognized at the time of the mandalay acquisition and a minor portion of the value of trade names related to the mandalay resorts the impairment charge resulted from factors affected by economic conditions at the time including 1 lower market valuation multiples for gaming assets 2 higher discount rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity markets and 3 cash flow forecasts for the mandalay resorts 

 

hurricane katrina and the monte carlo fire 

 

we maintain insurance for both property damage and business interruption relating to catastrophic events such as hurricane katrina affecting beau rivage in august 2005 and the rooftop fire at monte carlo in january 2008 business interruption coverage covers lost profits and other costs incurred during the closure period and up to six months following reopening 

 

hurricane katrina we reached final settlement agreements with our insurance carriers related to hurricane katrina in late 2007 in total we received insurance recoveries of 635 million which exceeded the 265 million net book value of damaged assets and poststorm costs incurred we recognized the 370 million of excess insurance recoveries in income in 2007 and 2006 in 2007 67 million and 217 million of such excess insurance recoveries were recognized as offsets to “general and administrative” expense and “property transactions net” respectively 

 

monte carlo fire we reached final settlement agreements for the monte carlo fire in early 2009 in total we received 74 million of proceeds from our insurance carriers we recognized the 41 million of excess insurance recoveries in income in 2009 and 2008 with recoveries offsetting a writedown of 4 million related to the net book value of damaged assets demolition costs of 7 million and operating costs of 21 million in 2009 15 million and 7 million of such excess insurance recoveries were recognized as offsets to “general and administrative” expense and “property transactions net” respectively in 2008 9 million and 10 million of such excess insurance recoveries were recognized as offsets to “general and administrative” expense and “property transactions net” respectively 

 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 certain results referenced in this section are on a “same store” basis excluding the results of ti 

summary financial results 

 

the following table summarizes our financial results 

 

 

 

net revenues decreased in 2009 and 2008 largely due to the economic factors discussed in “impact of economic conditions and credit markets on our results of operations” as discussed further in “operating results — detailed revenue information” revenues have decreased across all business lines we reduced departmental operating expenses to maximize operating results by implementing cost savings efforts but due to our leveraged business model a significant portion of the decline in revenue affected operating results and earnings 

 

corporate expense increased in 2009 as a result of higher legal and advisory costs associated with our activities to improve our financial position as well as the accrual of bonus expense in 2009 corporate expense in 2008 declined from 2007 as a result of cost reduction efforts throughout the year and no bonus accrual due to not meeting internal profit targets in addition corporate expenses in 2007 included costs associated with the citycenter joint venture transaction 

 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2009 due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated and the sale of ti in 2008 depreciation increased 11 due to the significant capital investments in our resorts in the previous few years in addition other transactions events and impairment charges had a significant impact on our earnings performance certain of which we discussed in the “executive overview” section as a result operating loss was 964 million and 130 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

operating results — adjusted ebitda 

 

“adjusted ebitda” is earnings before interest and other nonoperating income expense taxes depreciation and amortization preopening and startup expenses and property transactions net “adjusted property ebitda” is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense and in 2007 the gain on our citycenter transaction adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because we believe that these measures are 1 widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming industry and 2 a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies 

we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted property ebitda may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented also we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results for example preopening and startup expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and dependent on where the current period lies within the development cycle as well as the size and scope of the projects property transactions net includes normal recurring disposals and gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates which may not be comparable period over period 

 

in addition capital allocation tax planning financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level therefore we use adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of our operating resorts’ performance 

 

adjusted ebitda or adjusted property ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda in a different manner 

 

on a same store basis adjusted ebitda decreased 38 in 2009 and 23 in 2008 excluding the 203 million impact from the residential impairment charge recorded by citycenter the 12 million impairment charge related to our postponed joint venture project on the north las vegas strip and monte carlo insurance recoveries adjusted ebitda decreased 27 in 2009 

 

on a same store basis adjusted property ebitda decreased 34 in 2009 and 24 in 2008 excluding the charges noted above adjusted property ebitda decreased 23 in 2009 with a margin of 25 versus 28 in 2008 these decreases were largely due to the factors discussed in “summary financial results” and “impact of economic conditions and credit markets on our results of operations” our regional resorts were affected to a lesser extent than our las vegas strip resorts — adjusted property ebitda at gold strike tunica increased 43 in 2009 on top of a 19 increase in 2008 adjusted property ebitda at mgm grand detroit was flat in 2009 and 2008 

the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss 

 

 

 

the following tables present reconciliations of adjusted property ebitda and adjusted ebitda to operating income 

 

 

 

 

 

operating results — detailed revenue information 

 

the following table presents detail of our net revenues 

 

 

 

table games revenue decreased 11 or 9 on a same store basis due to a decrease in overall table games volume despite an increase of 33 for baccarat volume the table games hold percentage was near the midpoint of our normal range for all years presented 

 

slots revenue decreased 12 in 2009 or 9 on a same store basis driven by a decrease in volume at our las vegas strip resorts most of our las vegas strip resorts experienced decreases in the high single digits while mgm grand detroit and gold strike tunica experienced decreases in the low single digits in 2008 slots revenue at bellagio and mandalay bay decreased 4 while the majority of our other las vegas strip resorts experienced yearoveryear decreases in the low double digits slots revenue increased 7 at mgm grand detroit and 5 at gold strike tunica in 2008 

 

room revenue decreased 28 or 24 on a same store basis in 2009 and 10 in 2008 as a result of a decrease in occupancy and lower average room rates the following table shows key hotel statistics for our las vegas strip resorts 

 

 

 

food and beverage entertainment and retail revenues in 2009 and 2008 were negatively affected by lower customer spending and decreased occupancy at our resorts in 2009 entertainment revenues benefited from the addition of terry fator at the mirage in 2008 entertainment revenues benefited from the addition of believe at luxor other revenues in 2009 and 2008 included reimbursed costs from citycenter which were recognized as other revenue with corresponding amounts recognized as other expense reimbursed costs for citycenter were 95 million in 2009 and 46 million in 2008 

operating results — details of certain charges 

 

stock compensation expense is recorded within the department of the recipient of the stock compensation award the following table shows the amount of compensation expense related to employee stockbased awards 

 

 

 

 

 

preopening and startup expenses increased in 2009 as citycenter prepared for its december 2009 opening subsequent to the citycenter joint venture transaction in november 2007 we only recognize our 50 share of these preopening costs mgm grand macau’s preopening and startup expenses in 2007 related to our share of that venture’s preopening costs 

 

property transactions net consisted of the following 

 

 

 

see discussion of atlantic city renaissance pointe land citycenter investment insurance recoveries and goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets impairment charges under “executive overview” other writedowns during 2009 primarily related to the writeoff of various abandoned construction projects other writedowns and impairments in 2008 included 30 million related to land and building assets of primm valley golf club the 2008 period also includes demolition costs associated with various room remodel projects and a gain on the sale of an aircraft of 25 million insurance recoveries in 2009 and 2008 relate to the monte carlo fire and hurricane katrina in 2007 

 

writedowns and impairments in 2007 included writeoffs related to discontinued construction projects and a writeoff of the carrying value of the nevada landing building assets due to its closure in march 2007 the 2007 period also includes demolition costs primarily related to the mandalay bay room remodel 

operating results — income loss from unconsolidated affiliates 

 

we recognized a loss from unconsolidated affiliates of 88 million in 2009 these results include 203 million impact from the impairment charge recorded by citycenter related to its residential real estate under development and a 12 million charge related to development costs for our postponed joint venture project on the north las vegas strip income from unconsolidated affiliates in 2009 benefited from increased operating results at mgm grand macau which earned operating income of 60 million an increase of 74 over 2008 and 14 million related to insurance proceeds recognized at the borgata income from unconsolidated affiliates in 2007 included 93 million related to the sale of condominium units at the signature at mgm grand 

 

nonoperating results 

 

the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt 

 

 

 

in 2009 gross interest costs increased compared to 2008 mainly due to higher average debt balances during 2009 higher interest rates for borrowings under our senior credit facility in 2009 higher interest rates for newly issued fixed rate borrowings as well as breakage fees for voluntary repayments of our revolving credit facility in 2008 gross interest costs decreased compared to 2007 mainly due to lower interest rates on our variable rate borrowings 

 

capitalized interest increased in 2009 due to higher citycenter investment balances and higher weighted average cost of debt capitalized interest decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to less capitalized interest on citycenter and cessation of capitalized interest related to our investment in mgm grand macau upon opening in december 2007 the amounts presented above exclude noncash gross interest and corresponding capitalized interest related to our citycenter delayed equity contribution 

 

the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 

 

 

the income tax benefit provided on pretax loss in 2009 was greater than the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily as a result of state tax benefit on the writedown of land in atlantic city the writedown of goodwill in 2008 which is treated as a permanently nondeductible item in our federal income tax provision caused us to incur a provision for income tax expense even though our pretax result was a loss for the year excluding the effect of the goodwill writedown the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2008 was 373 this is higher than the 2007 rate due to the effect of the citycenter transaction on the 2007 rate which greatly minimized the effect of permanent and other tax items and due to the deduction taken in 2007 for domestic production activities resulting primarily from the citycenter transaction 

we received a net refund of cash taxes in 2009 due to income tax net operating losses incurred in 2009 and refunds of taxes that were paid in 2008 cash taxes were paid in 2008 despite the pretax operating loss due to the nondeductible goodwill writedown and cash taxes paid on the citycenter gain in 2008 since the citycenter gain was realized in the fourth quarter of 2007 the associated income taxes were paid in 2008 excluding the cash taxes paid on the citycenter gain cash taxes were approximately 250 million less in 2008 than in 2007 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flows — summary 

 

our cash flows consisted of the following 

 

 

 

cash flows — operating activities 

 

trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income excluding gains and losses from investing activities and net property transactions since our business is primarily cashbased cash flow from operations decreased 22 in 2009 due to a decrease in operating income and the sale of ti operating cash flows also decreased due to a 47 million increase in our receivable from citycenter partially offset by increased distributions from unconsolidated affiliates

our longterm debt consists of publicly held senior senior secured and senior subordinated notes and our senior credit facility we pay fixed rates of interest ranging from 5875 to 13 on the senior senior secured and subordinated notes at december 31 2009 our senior credit facility had a capacity of 55 billion consisting of a term loan facility of 21 billion and a revolving credit facility of 34 billion and interest was based on libor margin of 400 with a libor floor of 200 and a base margin at 300 with a base rate floor of 400 in late december 2009 we borrowed the remaining availability under the senior credit facility of 16 billion in order to increase our capacity for issuing additional senior secured notes under our existing public notes indentures and immediately repaid such amounts after yearend our senior credit facility contains certain financial and nonfinancial covenants the financial covenants include 1 a quarterly minimum ebitda test based on a rolling 12month ebitda and 2 a covenant limiting annual capital expenditures as discussed in “executive overview” we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility on february 25 2010 

 

all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our material subsidiaries other than mgm grand detroit llc our foreign subsidiaries and our insurance subsidiaries mgm grand detroit is a guarantor under the senior credit facility but only to the extent that mgm grand detroit llc borrows under such facility at december 31 2009 the outstanding amount of borrowings related to mgm grand detroit llc was 450 million in connection with our may 2009 senior credit facility amendment mgm grand detroit granted lenders a security interest in its assets to secure its obligations under the senior credit facility 

also in connection with our may 2009 senior credit facility amendment we granted a security interest in gold strike tunica and certain undeveloped land on the las vegas strip to secure up to 300 million of obligations under the senior credit facility in addition substantially all of the assets of new yorknew york serve as collateral for the 13 senior secured notes issued in 2008 and substantially all of the assets of bellagio and the mirage serve as collateral for the 10375 and 11125 senior secured notes issued in 2009 upon the issuance of the 10375 and 11125 senior secured notes the holders of our 13 senior secured notes due 2013 obtained an equal and ratable lien in all collateral securing these notes otherwise none of our assets serve as collateral for our principal debt arrangements 

 

other factors affecting liquidity 

 

longterm debt payable in 2010 we repaid 297 million of principal of senior notes due in february 2010 and have 782 million of principal of senior notes due in september 2010 

 

borgata settlement discussions as discussed in “executive overview” we are involved in constructive settlement discussions with the dge for an agreement under which we will sell our 50 ownership interest in borgata and related leased land in atlantic city prior to the consummation of the sale the trust will retain any cash flows received in respect of the assets in trust but will pay property taxes and other costs attributable to the trust property we have received significant distributions from borgata in the past few years and not receiving such distributions until the ultimate sale could negatively affect our liquidity in future periods 

 

off balance sheet arrangements 

 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which currently consist primarily of our investments in citycenter borgata grand victoria silver legacy and mgm grand macau we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we have not historically guaranteed financing obtained by our investees and there are no other provisions of the venture agreements which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort 

 

citycenter completion guarantee in april 2009 we entered into a new completion guarantee in conjunction with the citycenter credit facility which amended the original completion guarantees to a relieve dubai world of its completion guarantee as amounts are funded from its letter of credit and b require an unlimited completion and cost overrun guarantee from us secured by our interests in the assets of circus circus las vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land also affecting the potential exposure under the completion guarantee is the ability to utilize up to 244 million of net residential proceeds to fund construction costs though the timing of receipt of such proceeds is uncertain as of december 31 2009 we recorded a net liability of 150 million classified as “other accrued liabilities” which represents the low end of our estimated range for our net obligation under the completion guarantee we believe that it is reasonably possible we will be required to fund a net obligation of up to 300 million in january and february 2010 we funded 217 million under the completion guarantee citycenter will repay such amounts to us from proceeds of residential units 

 

letters of credit at december 31 2009 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 37 million though not subject to a letter of credit we have an agreement with the nevada gaming control board to maintain 113 million of cash at the corporate level to support normal bankroll requirements at our nevada operations 

commitments and contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

see “executive overview” for discussion of the impacts of the above contractual obligations on our liquidity and financial position 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states at december 31 2009 and 2008 approximately 40 and 52 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2009 and 2008 approximately 46 and 34 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east 

 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 

 

the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables 

 

 

 

the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due to a larger percentage of current receivables although percentage of accounts over 180 days has increased slightly from prior year at december 31 2009 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by 2 million or less than 001 per share 

 

fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

 

property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost has been determined based on estimated fair values in connection with the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries in addition interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment based on our classification as a held for sale or b to be held and used several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer for assets classified as held for sale we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset typically measured using a discounted cash flow model if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses 

 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets when appropriate we discount future cash flows using a weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry 

 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates indefinitelived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach and trademarks which are tested for impairment using the relieffromroyalty method 

 

there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment in particular future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates in addition the determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the goodwill impairment test are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions 

 

see “executive overview” and “results of operations” for discussion of writedowns and impairments of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2009 2008 and 2007 other than mentioned therein we are not aware of events or circumstances through december 31 2009 that would cause us to review any material longlived assets goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

 

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an “otherthantemporary” decline in value if these conditions exist we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is “otherthantemporary” based on our assessment of relevant factors including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates see “executive overview” for discussion of impairment charges recorded in 2009 related to our investment in citycenter 

 

income taxes 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied except for certain new jersey state net operating losses certain other new jersey state deferred tax assets and a foreign tax credit carryforward we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 

 

our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities 

 

we assess our tax positions using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized we review uncertain tax positions at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current “other accrued liabilities” or longterm “other longterm liabilities” based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material as of december 31 2009 we were no longer subject to examination of our us consolidated federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2003 in the fourth quarter of 2009 we reached settlement with the irs in postappeals mediation with respect to issues related to a land sale transaction in 2002 we agreed to an additional tax liability of 2 million and associated interest for the 2002 tax year as a result of this settlement we paid most of this tax and associated interest in a prior year in order to minimize the amount of interest due all matters concerning the irs audit of the 2001 and 2002 federal income tax returns are now settled the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years we anticipate this audit will close sometime in 2010 and we will likely protest many of the issues under audit federal income tax returns for years subsequent to 2004 are also subject to examination 

 

during 2009 the irs completed its audit of the 2004 through 2006 tax years of a subsidiary of ours treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and we submitted a protest to irs appeals with respect to issues relating to the tax treatment of payments made by the subsidiary under an agreement to develop own and operate a hotel casino in the city of detroit 

 

during 2009 the irs completed its audit of an unconsolidated affiliate of ours for the 2003 and 2004 tax years and we and our joint venture partner submitted a protest to irs appeals of various issues raised by the irs in the audit 

 

in the first quarter of 2010 the irs informed us that it was closing its examination of the federal income tax return of mandalay resort group for the preacquisition year ended april 25 2005 and will issue a “nochange letter” the statute of limitations for assessing tax for the mandalay resort group federal income tax return for the year ended january 31 2005 has been extended but such return is not currently under examination by the irs 

as of december 31 2009 we were no longer subject to examination of our various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2005 during 2009 the state of illinois notified us that it would initiate an audit of our illinois combined returns for the 2006 and 2007 tax years we anticipate this audit will begin during 2010 a mandalay resort group subsidiary return for the preacquisition year ended april 25 2005 is under examination by the city of detroit and the statute of limitations for assessing tax will expire in 2010 unless extended no other state or local income tax returns of ours are currently under exam 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stock options and stock appreciation rights “sars” measuring fair value using the blackscholes model for restricted stock units compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model our volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly affect the fair value of stock options and sars the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of awards in any given year in 2009 we granted 68 million sars with a total fair value of 37 million in 2008 we granted 49 million sars with a total fair value of 72 million in 2007 we granted 26 million sars with a total fair value of 68 million 

 

for 2009 awards a 10 change in the volatility assumption 82 for 2009 for sensitivity analysis volatility was assumed to be 74 and 90 would have resulted in a 25 million or 7 change in fair value a 10 change in the expected term assumption 47 years for 2009 for sensitivity analysis expected term was assumed to be 42 years and 52 years would have resulted in a 14 million or 4 change in fair value these changes in fair value would have been recognized over the fiveyear vesting period of such awards it should be noted that a change in the expected term would cause other changes since the riskfree rate and volatility assumptions are specific to the term we did not attempt to adjust those assumptions in performing the sensitivity analysis above 

 

recently issued accounting standards 

 

we adopted various accounting standards during 2009 none of which had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in addition certain amendments to accounting standards codification “asc” topic 810 “consolidation” become effective for us beginning january 1 2010 such amendments include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity “vie” an enterprise must determine if its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie by evaluating whether 1 the enterprise has the power to direct activities of the vie that have a significant effect on economic performance and 2 the enterprise has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the amendments to asc 810 also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie the adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

market risk 

 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixedrate debt instruments as fixedrate debt matures however and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures 

 

as of december 31 2009 longterm variable rate borrowings represented approximately 39 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor over the 2 floor specified in our senior credit facility our annual interest cost would change by approximately 55 million based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2009 the following table provides additional information about our longterm debt subject to changes in interest rates

 item 1 business 

  mgm mirage is referred to as the “company” or the “registrant” and together with our subsidiaries may also be referred to as “we” “us” or “our” 

overview 

mgm mirage is one of the world’s leading development companies with significant gaming and resort operations we believe the resorts we own manage and invest in are among the world’s finest casino resorts mgm mirage was organized as mgm grand inc on january 29 1986 and is a delaware corporation mgm mirage acts largely as a holding company and its operations are conducted through its whollyowned subsidiaries 

our strategy is based on developing and maintaining competitive advantages in the following areas 

 

resort portfolio 

we execute our strategy through a portfolio approach seeking to ensure that we own invest in and manage resorts in each market segment that are superior to our competitors’ resorts we also seek to own and invest in superior real estate assets with a blend of developing these assets on our own partnering with others and strategically buying and selling real estate 

our approach to resort ownership and investment is based on operating the premier resorts in each geographic market and each customer segment in which we operate we discuss customer segments in the “resort operation” section regarding our approach to resort locations we feel it is important to selectively operate in markets with stable regulatory environments as seen in the table below this means that a large portion of our resorts are located in nevada in addition we target markets with growth potential currently we believe that international markets particularly in asia offer the most attractive growth opportunities we also believe there is growth potential in investing in and managing nongaming resorts see the “sustainable growth” and “leveraging our brand and management assets” sections for further details on these initiatives 

  our operating resorts 

we have provided below certain information about our resorts as of december 31 2007 except as otherwise indicated we wholly own and operate the resorts shown below 

 

 

 

 further more detailed information about each of our operating resorts can be found in exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 

  investing in existing resorts 

we believe that ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires significant capital investment we have a track record of reinvesting cash flows into our existing resorts and we have achieved strong returns on these investments in the past 

for instance between 2003 and 2006 we invested a significant amount of capital at mgm grand las vegas with additions such as kÁ the acclaimed show by cirque du soleil the skylofts and west wing room enhancements two highly acclaimed restaurants by joël robuchon and new poker and race and sports areas that resort earned 290 million of operating income in 2007 a dramatic increase from the 127 million earned in 2002 similarly we transformed the mirage a resort many market observers credit with changing the face of the las vegas strip we felt strongly about the allure of the resort but also believed that customers need fresh updated experiences therefore we invested significant capital at the mirage between 2004 and 2006 adding several new restaurants a categorydefining nightclub jet  upgraded highlimit gaming areas and the beatlesthemed love show by cirque du soleil the mirage earned 108 million of operating income in 2003 in 2007 the mirage earned 173 million of operating income 

we expect to continue this strategy for the foreseeable future we have made and continue to make investments in mandalay bay luxor and excalibur and will continue to analyze the needs for similar investments in our other resorts 

in addition we have actively managed our portfolio of land holdings we own approximately 700 acres of land on the las vegas strip with a meaningful portion of those acres undeveloped or considered by us to be underdeveloped in 2007 we purchased 34 acres of land on the las vegas strip adjacent to our circus circus las vegas resort see discussion of recent projects announced for certain of our land holdings in las vegas and atlantic city in the “sustainable growth” section 

  risks associated with our portfolio strategy 

the principal risk factors relating to our current portfolio of resorts are 

 

 

resort operation 

our operating philosophy is predicated on creating resorts of memorable character treating our employees well and providing superior service for our guests we also seek to develop competitive advantages in specific markets and among specific customer groups 

  general 

we operate primarily in one segment the ownership and operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities over half of our net revenue is derived from nongaming activities a higher percentage than many of our competitors as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including nongaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities since we believe that the number of walkin customers affects the success of our casino resorts we design our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other hotels we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming segment which can cause variability in our results 

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization our results do not depend on key individual customers though our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers or the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a particular country or region can impact our results 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our whollyowned resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we generally have an operating philosophy that prefers ownership of amenities since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience however we do lease space to retail and food and beverage operators in certain situations particularly for branding opportunities we also operate many “managed” outlets utilizing third party management for specific expertise in areas such as restaurants and nightclubs as well as for branding opportunities 

  customers and competition 

our casino resorts generally operate in highly competitive environments we compete against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality and leisure and business travel companies our primary methods of competing successfully include 

 

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotelcasinos in the las vegas area including major hotelcasinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotelcasinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major facilities elsewhere in the las vegas area our las vegas strip resorts also compete in part with each other according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 133000 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2007 up slightly from approximately 132600 rooms at december 31 2006 las vegas visitor volume was 392 million in 2007 up slightly from the 389 million reported for 2006 

the principal segments of the las vegas gaming market are leisure travel premium gaming customers conventions including small meetings and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel our highend properties which include bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for ti new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome wagerers largely from the leisure travel and to a lesser extent the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments 

outside las vegas our other whollyowned nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similar sized and larger operations a significant portion of our customers at these resorts come from california we believe the expansion of native american gaming has had a negative impact on all of our nevada resorts not located on the las vegas strip and additional expansion in california could have a further adverse effect on these resorts our nevada resorts not located in las vegas appeal primarily to middleincome customers attracted by room food and beverage and entertainment prices that are lower than those offered by major las vegas hotelcasinos our target customer for these resorts is the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer 

outside nevada our whollyowned resorts mainly compete for customers in local gaming markets where location is a critical factor to success in tunica mississippi one of our competitors is closer to memphis the area’s principal market in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for instance in detroit michigan we also compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada and with native american casinos in michigan in biloxi mississippi we also compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi the florida market and with casinos in the bahamas 

our unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets and in some cases against our whollyowned operations much like our whollyowned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts 

our casino resorts also compete for customers with hotelcasino operations located in other areas of the united states and other parts of the world and for leisure and business travelers with nongaming tourist destinations such as hawaii florida and cruise ships our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states

we advertise on radio television and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as on the internet and by direct mail we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major united states and foreign cities a key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention segment we maintain internet websites which inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets we also operate call centers to allow customer contact by phone to make hotel and restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets 

we utilize our worldclass golf courses in marketing programs at our las vegas strip resorts our major las vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at shadow creek in connection with our marketing activities we also invite our premium gaming customers to play shadow creek on a complimentary basis we use primm valley golf club for marketing purposes at our las vegas resorts including offering room and golf packages at special rates additionally marketing efforts at beau rivage benefit from the fallen oak golf course just 20 minutes north of beau rivage 

  employees and management 

we believe that knowledgeable friendly and dedicated employees are a key success factor in the casino resort industry therefore we invest heavily in recruiting training and retaining our employees as well as seeking to hire and promote the strongest management team possible we have numerous programs both at the corporate and business unit level designed to achieve these objectives for example our diversity program extends throughout our company and focuses on the unique strengths of our individuals combined with a culture of working together to achieve greater performance our diversity program has been widely recognized including the honor of “top 50 best companies for diversity” given by diversityinc magazine we have also invested heavily in training and we believe our programs such as the mgm grand university and mgm mirage leadership programs are bestinclass among our industry peers 

  technology 

we utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations our players club program links our major resorts and consolidates all slots and table games activity for customers with a players club account customers qualify for benefits across all of the participating resorts regardless of where they play we believe that our players club enables us to more effectively market to our customers a large number of the slot machines at our resorts operate with international game technology’s ezpay™ cashless gaming system we believe that this system enhances the customer experience and increases the revenue potential of our slot machines 

technology is a critical part of our strategy in nongaming and administrative operations as well our hotel systems include yield management modules which allow us to maximize occupancy and room rates additionally these systems capture charges made by our customers during their stay including allowing customers of our resorts to charge meals and services at certain other mgm mirage resorts to their hotel accounts we implemented a new hotel management system at most of our major resorts in 2007 which we expect will enhance our guest service and improve our yield management across our portfolio of resorts 

  internal controls 

we have a strong culture of compliance driven by our history in the highly regulated gaming industry and our belief that compliance is often a valueadded activity our system of internal controls and procedures – including internal control over financial reporting – is designed to ensure reliable and accurate financial records transparent disclosures compliance with laws and regulations and protection of our assets our internal controls start at the source of business transactions and we have rigorous enforcement through controllership at both the business unit and corporate level our corporate management also review each of our businesses on a regular basis and we have a corporate internal audit function that performs reviews around gaming compliance internal controls over financial reporting and operational areas 

in connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements and other activities such as cash transaction reporting these controls include 

 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at certain of those casinos as well we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation 

in nevada mississippi michigan and illinois amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are enforceable under state laws all other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts owed for markers entered into in nevada mississippi illinois or michigan which are not timely paid pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states

  sustainable growth 

in allocating capital our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts spending on new resorts or initiatives repaying longterm debt and returning capital to shareholders we have actively allocated capital to each of these areas historically and expect to continue to do so we believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives that will provide returns in excess of the other options primarily we feel these opportunities are in the areas of largescale mixeduse development in established gaming markets international opportunities for gaming expansion – particularly in asia – and expansion into nongaming operations 

the following sections discuss certain of our current and potential development opportunities we regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the domestic and international markets but cannot determine the likelihood of proceeding with specific development opportunities opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in nevada or in states other than nevada or outside of the united states we may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties

 item 3 legal proceedings 

fair and accurate credit transaction act litigation 

on june 22 2007 the company was served with a purported nationwide class action lawsuit filed in federal district court in nevada  lety ramirez v mgm mirage inc et al  for alleged willful violations of the fair and accurate credit transactions act “facta” the lawsuit asserts that the company failed to comply timely with facta’s directive that merchants who accept credit andor debit cards not display more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the card expiration date on electronicallygenerated receipts provided to customers at the point of sale facta’s compliance deadline for electronic machines that were first put into service before january 1 2005 was december 4 2006 while electronic machines put into use on or after january 1 2005 required immediate compliance 

although the complaint does not assert that the plaintiff sustained any actual damage the plaintiff seeks on behalf of herself and all similarly situated putative class members throughout the united states statutory damages of 100 minimum to 1000 maximum for each transaction violation attorneys’ fees costs punitive damages and a permanent injunction 

by order entered december 3 2007 the district court denied the company’s motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety but granted the motion to strike from the complaint plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief the company then filed an answer to the complaint on december 20 2007 no discovery has been propounded on the plaintiff or the company on february 11 2008 the court granted the parties’ stipulation to stay this case pending issuance of a decision by the ninth circuit court of appeals on review of the order of a california federal district court denying class certification in a facta case 

we believe that plaintiff ramirez’s claims for class certification and other relief are unjustified and we will continue to vigorously defend our position in this case

citycenter joint venture transaction

key performance indicators 

we operate primarily in one segment the operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities over half of our net revenue is derived from nongaming activities a higher percentage than many of our competitors as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including nongaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization we believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world and a main focus of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain our competitive advantage 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results key performance indicators related to revenue are 

 

 

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

we generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks outside of our control such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts and the impact from expansion of gaming in california we are also exposed to risks related to tourism and the general economy including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year we market to different customer segments to manage our hotel occupancy such as targeting large conventions to ensure midweek occupancy our results do not depend on key individual customers though our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers or the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a particular country or region can impact our results 

overall outlook 

we believe that economic conditions in the united states including the downturn in the housing market and credit concerns during the latter half of 2007 and into 2008 have had and could continue to have a negative impact on our operating results the impact is currently most noticeable at our midmarket resorts particularly those outside of las vegas offsetting these macroeconomic conditions is the continued expected strength of las vegas as a tourist destination we also believe that we will continue to benefit from recent and ongoing strategic capital investments at our resorts our las vegas strip resorts require ongoing capital investment to maintain their competitive advantages we believe these investments in additional nongaming amenities have enhanced our ability to generate increased visitor volume and allow us to charge premium prices for our amenities in 2007 we completed many improvements at our las vegas strip resorts including 

 

these improvements along with other amenities and improvements projected to open in 2008 are expected to lead to increased customer volumes in gaming areas restaurants shops entertainment venues and our other resort amenities in addition the following items are relevant to our overall outlook 

 

 

financial statement impact of hurricane katrina 

beau rivage closed in late august 2005 due to significant damage sustained as a result of hurricane katrina and reopened in august 2006 we maintained insurance covering both property damage and business interruption as a result of the storm the deductible under this coverage was approximately 15 million based on the amount of damage incurred business interruption coverage covered lost profits and other costs incurred during the construction period and up to six months following the reopening of the facility 

as of december 31 2007 we had reached final settlement agreements with our insurance carriers and received insurance recoveries of 635 million which exceeded the 265 million of net book value of damaged assets and poststorm costs incurred all poststorm costs and expected recoveries have been recorded net within “general and administrative” expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income except for depreciation of nondamaged assets which is classified as “depreciation and amortization” during the year ended december 31 2007 we recognized 284 million of insurance recoveries in income of which 217 million was recorded within “property transactions net” and 67 million was recorded within “general and administrative expense” the remaining 86 million previously recognized in income was recorded within “property transactions net” in 2006 

cash received for insurance recoveries are classified as cash flows from investing activities if the recoveries relate to property damage and cash flows from operations if the recoveries relate to business interruption during 2007 we received 280 million in insurance recoveries of which 207 million was classified as investing cash flows and 73 million was classified as operating cash flows during 2006 we received 309 million in insurance recoveries of which 210 million was classified as investing cash flows and 99 million was classified as operating cash flows during 2005 we received 46 million in insurance recoveries all of which was classified as investing cash flows

operating results 

the following table includes key information about our operating results 

 

net revenues in 2007 included a full year of results for beau rivage excluding beau rivage net revenues increased 4 largely due to strength in hotel room rates and other nongaming revenues operating income increased 63 in 2007 over 2006 and included the citycenter gain higher hurricane katrina insurance recoveries income and a full year of operations at beau rivage these increases were partially offset by lower profits recognized from the sale of units at the signature at mgm grand and higher preopening expenses primarily related to the openings of mgm grand macau and mgm grand detroit excluding the impact from these items operating income for 2007 decreased approximately 5 compared to 2006 mainly related to higher depreciation and amortization expense related to our continued capital investments and higher corporate expense corporate expense increased 20 in 2007 over 2006 the increase in corporate expense is partially due to severance costs costs associated with our citycenter joint venture transaction and development costs associated with our planned mgm grand atlantic city project 

the 2006 and 2005 increase in net revenues resulted primarily from the addition of mandalay net revenues for 2006 included a full year of operations for mandalay resorts and 2005 included approximately 8 months of operations for mandalay resorts on a samestore basis net revenues increased 5 in 2006 operating income for 2006 increased 32 over 2005 same store operating income increased 15 partially due to the increases in revenues discussed above with continued strong operating margins in addition we recognized income of 102 million from our share of profits from the signature at mgm grand along with a 15 million gain on land contributed to the venture partially offsetting these items was the 70 million of incremental stockbased compensation expense excluding these items same store operating income increased 10 with an operating margin of 22 in 2006 compared to 21 in 2005 corporate expense increased 24 almost entirely due to 30 million of stockbased compensation 

operating results – detailed revenue information 

the following table presents detail of our net revenues 

 

table games revenue decreased 7 in 2007 excluding beau rivage as volumes were essentially flat the table games hold percentage was slightly lower in 2007 though in the normal range for both years in 2006 table games revenue increased 7 over 2005 on a same store basis with strong baccarat volume – up 4 – and a somewhat higher hold percentage but within the normal range in both periods 

excluding beau rivage slots revenue was flat in 2007 slots revenue was strong at many of our las vegas strip resorts including bellagio and mgm grand las vegas – each up 8 – and the mirage and mandalay bay – each up 5 these increases in slot revenues at our highend las vegas strip resorts were offset by lower revenues at our midmarket resorts in 2006 slots revenue increased 3 on a same store basis as a result of increases at mgm grand las vegas and ti 

hotel revenue increased 5 in 2007 excluding beau rivage with a 7 increase in company–wide revpar strength in demand and room pricing on the las vegas strip led to a 5 increase in adr and a slight increase in occupancy percentage to 93 in 2006 hotel revenue increased 4 over 2006 on a samestore basis due to strong room pricing leading to a 7 increase in samestore revpar 

the increases in food and beverage revenue in 2007 and 2006 are the result of investments in new restaurants and nightclubs in particular in 2007 we opened several new outlets at excalibur mandalay bay and luxor – including the lax nightclub also we opened several restaurants and the jet nightclub at the mirage throughout 2006 the strength in the business travel segment has also contributed to revenue growth at many of our highend restaurants and in catering operations 

entertainment revenues in 2007 and 2006 benefited from love  the beatlesthemed cirque du soleil show at the mirage which opened july 2006 in addition in 2007 we saw improved results in our production shows generally with higher occupancy at several shows compared to 2006 

in 2007 we generated 58 of net revenues from nongaming activities compared to 56 in 2006 and 55 in 2005 we expect this trend to continue in 2008 as we continue to invest in new nongaming amenities at our resorts and the mgm grand detroit hotel will be open for a full year

preopening and startup expenses consisted of the following 

 

preopening and startup expenses for citycenter will continue to increase as the project nears its expected completion in late 2009 however since we completed the citycenter joint venture transaction in november 2007 we will only recognize our 50 share of these preopening costs in the future mgm grand macau preopening and startup expenses relate to our share of that venture’s preopening costs preopening and startup expenses for the signature at mgm grand relate to our costs associated with preparing the towers for rental operations

nonoperating results 

the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt 

 

gross interest costs increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher average debt balances during the year up until the significant reduction in debt in the fourth quarter resulting from the 247 billion received upon the close of the citycenter joint venture transaction and the 12 billion received from our sale of common stock to a whollyowned subsidiary of dubai world net interest expense decreased due to increased capitalized interest from the ongoing construction of citycenter mgm grand detroit and mgm grand macau 

interest costs increased in 2006 over 2005 due to higher average outstanding debt resulting from a full year of debt outstanding related to the mandalay acquisition incremental borrowings in 2006 to fund capital investments and a slightly higher average interest rate capitalized interest increased in 2006 as we continued to capitalize interest on the citycenter construction and our investment in mgm grand macau the increase in our weighted average interest rate was due to slightly higher market rates which affects our variable rate debt 

the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate in 2007 was slightly higher than the statutory rate and the prior year rate the 2007 effective tax rate would have been higher except for the citycenter gain which greatly minimized the impact of permanent and other tax items additionally in 2007 a benefit for a deduction related to domestic production activities resulting primarily from the citycenter transaction was offset by nondeductible losses from unconsolidated foreign affiliates during the year 

the effective income tax rate in 2006 benefited from a reversal of tax reserves that were no longer required primarily due to guidance issued by the internal revenue service related to the deductibility of certain complimentaries the 2006 rate was still higher than the 2005 rate however as such reversal was less than the onetime tax benefit recognized in 2005 due to a tax benefit realized from the repatriation of foreign earnings from australia as a result of the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 

cash paid for income taxes increased only slightly in 2007 over 2006 despite significantly higher pretax income since the citycenter gain was realized in the fourth quarter of 2007 the associated income taxes will be paid in 2008 cash paid for income taxes increased significantly in 2006 due primarily to the payment of taxes on the gain on mandalay’s sale of motorcity casino taxable income associated with the sales of units at the signature at mgm grand and an increase in pretax income resulting from the mandalay merger and continued improvements in operating results 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows – summary

cash flows – operating activities 

trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income excluding gains and losses from investing activities and net property transactions since our business is primarily cashbased cash flow from operations decreased 18 in 2007 partially the result of trends in operating income excluding the citycenter gain katrinarelated income and other similar items in addition the company’s net cash outflows related to citycenter residential sales – construction expenditures and customer deposits – increased by 135 million cash flow from operations increased in 2006 over 2005 as a result of higher operating income offset by higher interest and tax payments – tax payments in particular increased to 369 million in 2006 versus 76 million in 2005

  off balance sheet arrangements 

  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which currently consist primarily of our investments in citycenter borgata grand victoria silver legacy and mgm grand macau we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we have not historically guaranteed financing obtained by our investees and there are no other provisions of the venture agreements which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort 

  citycenter  the estimated net project budget for citycenter is 80 billion after net residential proceeds of 27 billion the gross project budget consists of 87 billion of construction costs including capitalized interest 17 billion of land 02 billion of preopening expenses and 01 billion of intangible assets the construction costs land and intangible assets reflect the impact of 13 billion of positive valuation adjustments upon the contribution of the citycenter assets to the joint venture

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 

  allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well 

we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states at december 31 2007 and 2006 approximately 47 and 48 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2007 and 2006 approximately 38 and 37 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 

the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables 

 

the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due to a decrease in aging of accounts at december 31 2007 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by 27 million or less than 001 per share 

  fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost has been determined based on estimated fair values in connection with the april 2005 mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets we account for construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 34 “capitalization of interest cost” “sfas 34” interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities as defined in sfas 34 begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

  impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” for assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset typically measured using a discounted cash flow model if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets when appropriate we discount future cash flows using our weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model 

see “results of operations” for discussion of writedowns and impairments recorded in 2007 2006 and 2005 in 2006 we entered into agreements to sell primm valley resorts and laughlin properties the fair value less costs to sell exceeded the carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated other than the above items we are not aware of events or circumstances through december 31 2007 that would cause us to review any material longlived assets for impairment 

  income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” sfas 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied except for certain new jersey state net operating losses certain other new jersey state deferred tax assets a foreign tax credit carryforward and certain foreign deferred tax assets we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 

our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities while positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws we do not take such positions unless we have “substantial authority” to do so under the internal revenue code and applicable regulations we may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority that are not ultimately accepted by the irs 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 requires that tax positions be assessed using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized as required by the standard we review uncertain tax positions at each balance sheet date liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current “other accrued liabilities” or longterm “other longterm liabilities” based on the time until expected payment additionally we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense a policy that did not change as a result of the adoption of fin 48 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material we are no longer subject to examination of our us federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2003 while the irs examination of the 2001 and 2002 tax years closed during the first quarter of 2007 the statute of limitations for assessing tax for such years has been extended in order for us to complete the appeals process for issues that were not agreed upon at the closure of the examination it is reasonably possible that this appeal may be settled in the next 12 months the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years tax returns for subsequent years are also subject to examination 

we are no longer subject to examination of our various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2003 during 2007 the city of detroit initiated an examination of a mandalay resort group subsidiary return for the preacquisition year ended april 25 2005 also during 2007 the state of mississippi initiated an examination of returns filed by subsidiaries of mgm mirage and mandalay resort group for the 2004 through 2006 tax years this audit was settled during the first quarter of 2008 with no material impact to us no other state or local income tax returns are under examination 

  stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas 123r we measure fair value of sharebased awards using the blackscholes model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model our volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stockbased awards the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of stockbased awards in any given year in 2007 we granted 26 million stock appreciation rights with a total fair value of 68 million in 2006 we granted 19 million stock options and stock appreciation rights with a total fair value of 28 million 

for 2007 awards a 10 change in the volatility assumption 32 for 2007 for sensitivity analysis volatility was assumed to be 29 and 35 would have resulted in a 46 million or 7 change in fair value a 10 change in the expected term assumption 41 years for 2007 for sensitivity analysis expected term was assumed to be 37 years and 45 years would have resulted in a 38 million or 6 change in fair value these changes in fair value would have been recognized over the fiveyear vesting period of such awards it should be noted that a change in the expected term would cause other changes since the riskfree rate and volatility assumptions are specific to the term we did not attempt to adjust those assumptions in performing the sensitivity analysis above 

  business combinations 

we account for business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “accounting for business combinations” “sfas 141” and statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets” and related interpretations sfas 141 requires that we record the net assets of acquired businesses at fair value and we must make estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities 

the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in the mandalay acquisition required us to make certain fair value estimates primarily related to land property and equipment and intangible assets these estimates require significant judgment and include a variety of assumptions in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities including market data estimated future cash flows growth rates current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets market rate assumptions for contractual obligations and settlement plans for contingencies and liabilities 

recently issued accounting standards 

  accounting for business combinations and noncontrolling interests 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 141 r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” and sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas 160” these standards amend the requirements for accounting for business combinations including the recognition and measurement of additional assets and liabilities at their fair value expensing of acquisitionrelated costs which are currently capitalizable under existing rules treatment of adjustments to deferred taxes and liabilities subsequent to the measure period and the measurement of noncontrolling interest previously commonly referred to as minority interests at fair value sfas 141r also includes additional disclosure requirements with respect to the methodologies and techniques used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities recognized in a business combination sfas 141r and sfas 160 apply prospectively to fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 except for the treatment of deferred tax adjustments which apply to deferred taxes recognized in previous business combinations these standards will become effective for us on january 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the effect if any the adoption of sfas 141r and sfas 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

  impact of buysell clauses on sales of real estate

operations 

we operate primarily in one segment the operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities over half of our net revenue is now derived from nongaming activities a higher percentage than many of our competitors as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including nongaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality we believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world and a main focus of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain our competitive advantage 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming segment which can cause variability in our results 

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year at our whollyowned resorts our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we generally have an operating philosophy that prefers ownership of amenities since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience however we do lease space to retail and food and beverage operators in certain situations particularly for branding opportunities we also operate many “managed” outlets utilizing third party management for specific expertise in areas such as restaurants and nightclubs as well as for branding opportunities since we believe that the number of walkin customers also affects the success of our casino resorts we design our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other hotels 

we utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations we are in the process of implementing our players club program to the major mandalay resorts when the process is complete players club will link our major resorts and consolidate all slots and table games activity for customers with a players club account under the combined program customers will qualify for benefits across all of these resorts regardless of where they play we believe that our players club enables us to more effectively market to our customers a significant portion of the slot machines at our resorts operate with international game technology’s ezpay™ cashless gaming system including the mandalay resorts where we recently converted many of the slot machines to ezpay™ we believe that this system enhances the customer experience and increases the revenue potential of our slot machines 

technology is a critical part of our strategy in nongaming and administrative operations as well our hotel systems include yield management modules which allow us to maximize occupancy and room rates additionally these systems capture charges made by our customers during their stay including allowing customers of our resorts to charge meals and services at other mgm mirage resorts to their hotel accounts we are implementing a new hotel management system at most of our major resorts started in 2006 and continuing in 2007 and 2008 which we expect will enhance our guest service and improve our yield management across our portfolio of resorts

the principal segments of the las vegas gaming market are leisure travel premium gaming customers conventions including small meetings and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel our highend properties which include bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for ti new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome wagerers largely from the leisure travel and to a lesser extent the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments 

outside las vegas our other whollyowned nevada operations compete with each other and with many other similar sized and larger operations a significant portion of our customers at these resorts come from california we believe the expansion of native american gaming has had a negative impact on all of our nevada resorts not located on the las vegas strip and additional expansion in california could have a further adverse effect on these resorts our nevada resorts not located in las vegas appeal primarily to middleincome customers attracted by room food and beverage and entertainment prices that are lower than those offered by major las vegas hotelcasinos our target customer for these resorts is the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer 

outside nevada our whollyowned resorts mainly compete for customers in local gaming markets where location is a critical success factor in tunica mississippi one of our competitors is closer to memphis the area’s principal market in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for instance in detroit michigan we also compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada in biloxi mississippi we also compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi the south florida leisure market and with casinos in the bahamas 

our unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets and in some cases against our whollyowned operations much like our whollyowned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts 

our casino resorts also compete for customers with hotelcasino operations located in other areas of the united states and other parts of the world and for leisure and business travelers with nongaming tourist destinations such as hawaii florida and cruise ships our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states 

  marketing 

we advertise on radio television and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as on the internet and by direct mail we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major united states and foreign cities a key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention segment we maintain internet websites which inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets we also operate call centers to allow customer contact by phone to make hotel and restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets 

we utilize our worldclass golf courses in marketing programs at our las vegas strip and other nevada resorts our major las vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at shadow creek in connection with our marketing activities we also invite our premium gaming customers to play shadow creek on a complimentary basis we use primm valley golf club for marketing purposes at our las vegas and primm resorts including offering room and golf packages at special rates marketing efforts at beau rivage will benefit from the newly opened fallen oak golf course just 20 minutes north of beau rivage 

  competitive risks 

the principal negative factors relating to our competitive position are 

 

 

control over gaming activities 

  general 

in connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements these controls include 

 

  issuance of markers 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at certain of those casinos as well 

we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation a significant portion of our company’s accounts receivable for amounts unpaid resulting from markers which are not collectible through banking channels is owed by major casino customers from the far east the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries 

in nevada mississippi michigan and illinois amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are enforceable under state laws all other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts owed for markers entered into in nevada mississippi illinois or michigan which are not timely paid pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states 

employees and labor relations 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 56800 fulltime and 13200 parttime employees at that date we had collective bargaining contracts with unions covering approximately 30000 of our employees we consider our employee relations to be good our contract with the culinary union covering approximately 21000 employees at most of our las vegas strip properties expires in may 2007 the contract covering employees at mgm grand does not expire in 2007 in addition our contract with various unions covering approximately 1700 employees at mgm grand detroit expires in october 2007 

regulation and licensing 

the gaming industry is highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located these laws rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility financial stability and character of the owners managers and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions a more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in exhibit 99 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 

our businesses are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted material changes new laws or regulations or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results

 item 3 legal proceedings 

boardwalk shareholder litigation 

on september 28 1999 a former stockholder of our subsidiary which owns and until january 2006 operated the boardwalk hotel and casino filed a first amended complaint in a putative class action lawsuit in district court for clark county nevada against mirage resorts and certain former directors and principal stockholders of the boardwalk subsidiary the complaint alleged that mirage resorts induced the other defendants to breach their fiduciary duties to boardwalk’s minority stockholders by devising and implementing a scheme by which mirage resorts acquired boardwalk at significantly less than the true value of its shares the complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages from mirage resorts and punitive damages from the other defendants whom we are required to defend and indemnify 

in june 2000 the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted the plaintiff appealed the ruling to the nevada supreme court the parties filed briefs with the nevada supreme court and oral arguments were conducted in october 2001 in february 2003 the nevada supreme court overturned the district court’s order granting our motion to dismiss the complaint and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on the elements of the lawsuit involving wrongful conduct in approving the merger andor in the valuation of the merged corporation’s shares the nevada supreme court affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims for lost profits and mismanagement the nevada supreme court’s ruling relates only to the district court’s ruling on our motion to dismiss and is not a determination of the merits of the plaintiff’s case the plaintiff filed an amended complaint and in november 2003 the district court certified the action as a class action

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

  current operations 

at december 31 2006 our operations consisted of 23 whollyowned casino resorts and 50 investments in three other casino resorts including 

 

other operations include the shadow creek golf course in north las vegas two golf courses at primm valley fallen oak golf course in saucier mississippi a 50 investment in the signature at mgm grand a condominiumhotel development adjacent to mgm grand las vegas and a 50 investment in mgm grand paradise limited which is constructing a casino resort in macau 

in october 2006 we agreed to sell the primm valley resorts not including the two golf courses and the laughlin properties in february 2007 we entered into an agreement to contribute the jean properties to a joint venture see “other factors affecting liquidity” 

  mandalay acquisition 

on april 25 2005 we closed our merger with mandalay resort group “mandalay” under which we acquired mandalay for 71 in cash for each share of common stock of mandalay the total acquisition cost of 73 billion included equity value of approximately 48 billion the assumption or repayment of outstanding mandalay debt with a fair value of approximately 29 billion and 01 billion of transaction costs offset by the 05 billion received by mandalay from the sale of its interest in motorcity casino in detroit michigan 

the mandalay acquisition expanded our portfolio of resorts on the las vegas strip expanded our employee and customer bases significantly and provided additional sites for future development these factors resulted in the recognition of certain intangible assets and significant goodwill we did not incur any significant employee termination costs or other exit costs in connection with the mandalay acquisition 

  key performance indicators 

we operate primarily in one segment the operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities over half of our net revenue is now derived from nongaming activities a higher percentage than many of our competitors as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including nongaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization we believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world and a main focus of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain our competitive advantage 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming customers which can cause variability in our results key performance indicators related to revenue are 

 

 

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

we generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks outside of our control such as competition from other recently opened or expanded las vegas resorts and the impact from expansion of gaming in california we are also exposed to risks related to tourism and the general economy including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year we market to different customer segments to manage our hotel occupancy such as targeting large conventions to ensure midweek occupancy our results do not depend on key individual customers though our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers or the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a particular country or region can impact our results 

  overall outlook 

we believe we will continue to benefit in 2007 from the strategic capital investments we have made in our resorts over the past several years our las vegas strip resorts require ongoing capital investment to maintain their competitive advantages we believe these investments in additional nongaming amenities have enhanced our ability to generate increased visitor volume and allow us to charge premium prices for our amenities we expect to continue to reinvest in our core assets on a targeted basis in 2007 

in 2006 we completed many capital improvements at a variety of resorts including 

 

in addition to entertainment offerings and several restaurants we have invested heavily in our room product in the past few years in 2007 we expect to complete a suite remodel at bellagio and standard room remodels at mandalay bay mgm grand las vegas and excalibur these improvements along with other amenities and improvements projected to open in 2007 are expected to lead to continued increases in revpar and increased customer volumes in gaming areas restaurants shops entertainment venues and our other resort amenities 

we began recognizing our share of profits from condominium sales at the signature at mgm grand in 2006 and will continue to do so in 2007 sales of all units in tower 1 and 87 of units in tower 2 were sold and closed by the end of 2006 in 2007 we expect to close on the remaining units in tower 2 and most or all the tower 3 units in addition to the income we will recognize in 2007 related to towers 2 and 3 we have begun to rent out units in towers 1 and 2 for owners who have elected to participate in the rental program rental of these units will provide additional revenues and also provide additional customer volumes at mgm grand las vegas 

in addition to the activity at our las vegas strip resorts we expect the permanent mgm grand detroit casino resort to open in late 2007 the permanent facility will feature a significantly larger casino and a 400room hotel as well as additional restaurants and other amenities also beau rivage reopened in august 2006 and we believe its operations as well as additional income from insurance recoveries will benefit results in 2007 mgm grand macau is on target to open in the fourth quarter of 2007 and we are anticipating significant earnings from this venture once opened 

  financial statement impact of hurricane katrina 

beau rivage closed in late august 2005 due to significant damage sustained as a result of hurricane katrina and reopened in august 2006 the company maintained insurance covering both property damage and business interruption as a result of the storm the deductible under this coverage was approximately 15 million based on the amount of damage incurred business interruption coverage covered lost profits and other costs incurred during the period of closure and up to six months following the reopening of the facility 

as of december 31 2006 we had received interim insurance recoveries in excess of the net book value of damaged assets and poststorm costs incurred the costs incurred to date were less than the anticipated business interruption proceeds therefore all poststorm costs and expected recoveries have been recorded net within “general and administrative” expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income except for depreciation of nondamaged assets which is classified as “depreciation and amortization” insurance recoveries received in excess of the amount of damaged assets and poststorm costs incurred of 86 million have been recognized as income related to property damage and included in “property transactions net” within the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

cash received for insurance recoveries are treated in the statement of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities if the recoveries relate to property damage and cash flows from operations if the recoveries relate to business interruption during 2006 we received 309 million in insurance recoveries we classified 200 million as investing cash flows related to property damage and 109 million as operating cash flows 

results of operations 

  summary financial results 

the following table summarizes our financial results 

 

references to “samestore” throughout management’s discussion and analysis exclude the mandalay resorts monte carlo and beau rivage including income from insurance recoveries for all periods we owned 50 of monte carlo prior to the mandalay acquisition and acquired the other 50 in the mandalay acquisition 

on a consolidated basis the most important factors and trends contributing to our performance over the last three years have been 

 

 

as a result of the above factors our net revenues increased 17 in 2006 and 53 in 2005 operating margins were 25 in 2006 compared to 22 in 2005 and 23 in 2004 see further discussion of operating income and operating margins in “operating results” below the increase in income from continuing operations generally resulted from the increased operating income offset in part by increased interest expense discussed below in “nonoperating results” 

  operating results 

the following table includes key information about our operating results 

 

the 2006 and 2005 increase in net revenues resulted primarily from the addition of mandalay net revenues for 2006 includes a full year of operations for mandalay resorts and 2005 includes approximately 8 months of operations for mandalay resorts on a samestore basis net revenues increased 5 in 2006 on top of a 12 increase in 2005 additionally net revenues increased significantly at many of our resorts in both 2006 and 2005 as a result of stronger yearoveryear room pricing and increased volumes in gaming and across all nongaming areas these trends were particularly prominent at bellagio the mirage and mgm grand las vegas as a result of new and expanded amenities at those resorts 

operating income for 2006 increased 32 over 2005 same store operating income increased 15 partially due to the increases in revenues discussed above with continued strong operating margins in addition we recognized income of 102 million from our share of profits from the signature at mgm grand along with a 15 million gain on land contributed to the venture partially offsetting these items was the 70 million of incremental stockbased compensation expense excluding these items same store operating income increased 10 with an operating margin of 22 in 2006 compared to 21 in 2005 

in 2005 operating income did not increase to the same extent as net revenues largely due to already strong operating margins a lowerthannormal bad debt provision in 2004 higher corporate expense and higher preopening restructuring and property transactions net this resulted in an operating margin of 21 versus 24 in 2004 corporate expense increased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to merger integration costs 

operating margins in 2007 will be positively impacted by additional profits on the sale of the remaining condominium units at the signature at mgm grand and any income recognized for additional insurance recoveries related to hurricane katrina excluding these items from both 2007 and 2006 we expect margins will remain relatively consistent between periods 

  operating results — detailed revenue information 

the following table presents detail of our net revenues 

 

on a samestore basis table games revenue including baccarat increased 7 over 2005 with strong baccarat volume — up 4 — and a somewhat higher hold percentage in 2005 table games revenue including baccarat was flat on a samestore basis a 4 increase in table games volume was offset by a slightly lower hold percentage hold percentages were within our normal range for all three years presented

  nonoperating results 

the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt 

 

interest costs increased in 2006 over 2005 due to higher average outstanding debt due to a full year of debt outstanding related to the mandalay acquisition incremental borrowings in 2006 to fund capital investments and a slightly higher average interest rate capitalized interest increased in 2006 as we continued to capitalize interest on the citycenter construction and our investment in mgm grand macau the increase in our weighted average interest rate was due to slightly higher market rates which affects our variable rate debt 

interest cost was higher in 2005 due to the funding of the cash consideration in the mandalay acquisition through senior credit facility borrowings and the assumption of debt in the mandalay acquisition while variable market interest rates continued to increase in 2005 our effective interest rate decreased due to a more normalized ratio of variable rate debt in 2005 our variable interest rate under our senior credit facility has been lower than the interest rates on our fixedrate borrowings capitalized interest increased in 2005 as we began capitalizing interest on citycenter and our investment in mgm grand macau 

the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 

the effective income tax rate in 2006 was slightly higher than 2005 tax reserves that were no longer required primarily due to guidance issued by the internal revenue service related to the deductibility of certain complimentaries were reversed during 2006 but such reversal was less than the onetime tax benefit recognized in 2005 due to the repatriation of foreign earnings from australia — see below 

the effective income tax rate in 2005 was lower than in 2004 due primarily to a tax benefit realized from the repatriation of foreign earnings from australia as a result of the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 that provided for a special onetime deduction of 85 percent on certain repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries additionally in 2004 the company accrued additional state deferred taxes related to capital investments in new jersey and incurred nondeductible costs related to a michigan ballot initiative neither of these items recurred in 2005 

cash paid for income taxes increased significantly in 2006 due primarily to the payment of taxes on the gain on mandalay’s sale of motorcity casino taxable income associated with the sales of units at the signature at mgm grand and an increase in pretax income resulting from the mandalay merger and continued improvements in operating results 

in 2005 taxes paid were lower than 2004 in part due to increased tax benefits from stock option exercises and onetime benefit plan deductions partially offset by decreased accelerated tax depreciation deductions and increased pretax income in addition a federal tax overpayment from 2004 was applied to 2005 reducing the 2005 tax payments 

liquidity and capital resources 

  cash flows — summary 

our cash flows consisted of the following 

 

  cash flows — operating activities 

trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income excluding noncash charges since our business is primarily cashbased cash flow from operations has increased in each of the last two years as a result of higher operating income offset by higher interest and tax payments — tax payments in particular increased to 369 million in 2006 versus 76 million in 2005 in addition 109 million of insurance recoveries has been reflected as operating cash inflows in 2006 and 90 million of spending on citycenter residential projects has been reflected as operating cash outflows in 2006 in 2006 the 48 million excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation is included as cash flows from financing activities in prior years this amount was included in operating cash flows 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 we held cash and cash equivalents of 453 million and 378 million respectively we require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts the amount required on hand increased in 2006 due to the reopening of beau rivage and the implementation of ticket and atm kiosks on our gaming floors which increase efficiency for customer transactions but require more cash on hand beyond our cash on hand we utilize a companywide cash management system to minimize the amount of cash held in banks funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central bank accounts and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our bank credit facilities 

  cash flows — investing activities 

in 2006 we spent 14 billion excluding capitalized interest on development projects including the nonresidential components of citycenter the permanent mgm grand detroit resort and the rebuilding of beau rivage remaining capital expenditures of 500 million consisted of capital expenditures at existing resorts including spending on the new theatre and new restaurants at the mirage and capitalized interest investments in unconsolidated affiliates of 86 million in the 2006 period represent partial funding of a required loan in an amount up to 100 million including accrued interest to mgm grand macau we are accounting for the loan as additional capital investment due to the subordinated nature of our repayment rights under the loan also construction payables increased due to an increase in construction activity at citycenter which is included in “other” in the above table offsetting these expenditures was 200 million in insurance proceeds related to hurricane katrina 

in 2005 capital expenditures were 760 million and included room enhancements and other projects at mgm grand las vegas expenditures for the mirage theatre and preliminary expenditures for citycenter and the permanent casino in detroit also in the 2005 period we completed the acquisition of mandalay with net cash paid of 44 billion and invested 183 million in mgm grand macau 

capital expenditures in 2004 consisted of capital projects such as the bellagio expansion and the kÀ theatre at mgm grand las vegas and maintenance capital activities such as room remodel projects at new york — new york and mgm grand las vegas and new restaurant and entertainment amenities at several resorts the sale of the golden nugget subsidiaries closed in january 2004 with net proceeds to the company of 210 million the sale of mgm grand australia closed in july 2004 with net proceeds to the company of 136 million 

  cash flows — financing activities 

we borrowed net debt of 662 million in 2006 the increase in net debt was due primarily to the level of capital expenditures investments in unconsolidated affiliates and share repurchases at december 31 2006 our senior credit facility had a balance of 44 billion with available liquidity of 26 billion we had the following issuances of senior notes in 2006

  citycenter  in november 2004 we announced a plan to develop a multibillion dollar urban metropolis citycenter on the las vegas strip between bellagio and monte carlo citycenter will feature a 4000room casino resort designed by worldfamous architect cesar pelli two 400room boutique hotels one of which will be managed by luxury hotelier mandarin oriental approximately 470000 square feet of retail shops dining and entertainment venues and approximately 23 million square feet of residential space in approximately 2700 luxury condominium and condominiumhotel units in multiple towers

we believe that a large portion of the costs to rebuild beau rivage will be covered under our insurance policies however we cannot determine the exact amount of reimbursement until we submit our claims and receive notice of approval from our insurers it is also uncertain as to the timing of such reimbursements and we have been funding the rebuilding costs in advance of receiving reimbursements from our insurers 

  new york racing association  we have entered into a definitive agreement with the new york racing association “nyra” to manage video lottery terminals “vlts” at nyra’s aqueduct horseracing facility in metropolitan new york subject to receipt of requisite new york state approvals we will assist in the development of the facility including providing project financing up to 190 million and will manage the facility for a term of five years extended automatically if the financing provided by us is not fully repaid for a fee we believe based on recent legislative changes that our agreement with respect to installation of vlts at aqueduct would extend past the expiration of nyra’s current racing franchise and would be binding on any successor to nyra in the event nyra is not granted a new racing franchise nyra’s recent filing for reorganization under chapter 11 has introduced additional uncertainties but we remain committed to the development once these uncertainties are resolved 

  mashantucket pequot tribal nation  we have agreed to enter a strategic alliance subject to definitive agreements with the mashantucket pequot tribal nation “mptn” the strategic alliance has several elements one of which calls for the creation of a 5050 joint venture to seek future development opportunities we have agreed to provide a development subsidiary of mptn with a loan of up to 200 million intended to fund a portion of that subsidiary’s matching investment in any future joint development projects

  off balance sheet arrangements 

our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which currently consist primarily of our investments in borgata grand victoria silver legacy mgm grand macau and the signature at mgm grand we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we provided a guaranty for up to 50 of the interest and principal payment obligations on the construction financing for the signature at mgm grand otherwise we have not guaranteed financing obtained by our investees nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort 

at december 31 2006 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 59 million of which 50 million support bonds issued by the economic development corporation of the city of detroit these bonds are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets this obligation was undertaken to secure our right to develop a permanent casino in detroit 

  commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december 31 2006 

 

 

   summary of expected sources and uses of funds 

in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above other significant operating uses of cash in 2007 include tax payments and uncommitted capital spending on citycenter residential projects other significant investing uses of cash flow in 2007 include uncommitted capital expenditures expected to be approximately 15 billion excluding capitalized interest and the residential components of citycenter 

we plan to fund our contractual obligations and other estimated spending through a combination of operating cash flow available borrowings under our senior credit facility and potential issuances of fixed rate longterm debt we generated almost 12 billion in operating cash flow in 2006 which included deductions for interest payments tax payments and certain contractually committed payments reflected in the above table including operating leases employment agreements and entertainment agreements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 

  allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well 

we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states at december 31 2006 and 2005 approximately 48 and 44 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2006 and 2005 approximately 37 and 42 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 

the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables 

 

the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has increased slightly in the current year due to aging of accounts at december 31 2006 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by 16 million or less than 001 per share 

  fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost has been determined based on estimated fair values in connection with the mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets we account for construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 34 “capitalization of interest cost” “sfas 34” interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities as defined in sfas 34 begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

  impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” for assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset typically measured using a discounted cash flow model if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets when appropriate we discount future cash flows using our weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model 

see “results of operations” for discussion of writedowns and impairments recorded in 2006 2005 and 2004 in october 2006 we entered into agreements to sell primm valley resorts and laughlin properties the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated in february 2004 we entered into an agreement to sell mgm grand australia the fair value less costs to sell exceeded the carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated other than the above items we are not aware of events or circumstances through december 31 2006 that would cause us to review any material longlived assets for impairment 

  income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” sfas 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied 

at december 31 2006 we had 144 million of deferred tax assets and 35 billion of deferred tax liabilities except for certain new jersey state net operating losses certain other new jersey state deferred tax assets a foreign tax credit carryforward and certain foreign deferred tax assets we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income the valuation allowance at december 31 2006 related to the new jersey deferred tax assets the foreign tax credit carryforward and foreign deferred tax assets were 6 million 2 million and 2 million respectively 

our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities while positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws we do not take such positions unless we have “substantial authority” to do so under the internal revenue code and applicable regulations we may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority that are not ultimately accepted by the irs 

we assess such potential unfavorable outcomes based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “sfas 5” we establish a tax reserve if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the unfavorable outcome can be reasonably estimated we assess the potential outcomes of tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis in determining whether the probable criterion of sfas 5 is met we presume that the taxing authority will focus on the exposure and we assess the probable outcome of a particular issue based upon the relevant legal and technical merits we also apply our judgment regarding the potential actions by the tax authorities and resolution through the settlement process 

we maintain required tax reserves until such time as the underlying issue is resolved when actual results differ from reserve estimates we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period resolved for tax years that are examined by taxing authorities we adjust tax reserves in the year the tax examinations are settled for tax years that are not examined by taxing authorities we adjust tax reserves in the year that the statute of limitations expires in addition resolution of uncertainties may occur upon the issuance of specific irs guidance on the issue our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters see also “recently issued accounting standards — uncertain tax positions” 

in the third quarter of 2006 we reversed tax reserves of 6 million that were no longer required based upon guidance issued by the irs during the quarter related to the deductibility of certain complimentaries resulting in a reduction in our provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2004 the statute of limitations expired for our 2000 tax return resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of 6 million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes 

the irs is in the final stages of auditing our 2001 and 2002 tax returns and has initiated an audit of the 2003 and 2004 tax returns the tax returns for subsequent years are also subject to possible future examination the statutes of limitation for assessing tax have expired on all years prior to 2001 

we classify reserves for tax uncertainties within “other accrued liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets separate from any related income tax payable or deferred income taxes reserve amounts may relate to the deductibility of an item as well as potential interest associated with those items 

a portion of our tax reserves was assumed in the mirage resorts and mandalay acquisitions any future adjustments to the acquired mirage resorts and mandalay tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 

  stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas 123r we measure fair value of sharebased awards using the blackscholes model there are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the blackscholes model we have determined that our volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stockbased awards the extent of the impact will depend in part on the extent of stockbased awards in any given year in 2006 we granted 19 million stock appreciation rights with a total fair value of 28 million in 2005 we granted 146 million stock options and stock appreciation rights with a total fair value of 186 million 

for 2006 awards a 10 change in the volatility assumption 33 for 2006 for sensitivity analysis volatility was assumed to be 30 and 36 would have resulted in a 18 million or 6 change in fair value a 10 change in the expected term assumption 41 years for 2006 for sensitivity analysis expected term was assumed to be 37 years and 45 years would have resulted in a 15 million or 5 change in fair value these changes in fair value would have been recognized over the fiveyear vesting period of such awards it should be noted change that a change in the expected term would cause other changes since the riskfree rate and volatility assumptions are specific to the term we did not attempt to adjust those assumptions in performing the sensitivity analysis above

we account for business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “accounting for business combinations” “sfas 141” and statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” and related interpretations sfas 141 requires that we record the net assets of acquired businesses at fair value and we must make estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities 

the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in the mandalay acquisition required us to make certain fair value estimates primarily related to land property and equipment and intangible assets these estimates require significant judgment and include a variety of assumptions in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities including market data estimated future cash flows growth rates current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets market rate assumptions for contractual obligations and settlement plans for contingencies and liabilities 

recently issued accounting standards 

  uncertain tax positions 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 requires that tax positions be assessed using a twostep process a tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date liabilities recorded as a result of this analysis must generally be recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified based on the time until expected payment 

fin 48 also requires additional disclosures related to uncertain tax positions including a reconciliation of changes in the beginning and ending aggregate amounts of liability recorded for uncertain tax positions fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 

upon adoption of fin 48 in the first quarter of 2007 we expect to record an adjustment to stockholders’ equity as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and a reclassification between deferred income taxes and other accrued liabilities we have completed an initial evaluation of the impact of the adoption of fin 48 and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  materiality of financial statement misstatements 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “sab 108” which documents the sec staff’s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements under sab 108 we must evaluate the materiality of an identified unadjusted error by considering the impact of both the current year error and the cumulative error if applicable this also means that both the impact on the current period income statement and the periodend balance sheet must be considered 

sab 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 any past adjustments required to be recorded as a result of adopting sab 108 are recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings the adoption of sab 108 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  planned major maintenance activities 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position no aug air1 “accounting for planned major maintenance activities” “fsp aug air1” fsp aug air1 prohibits the use of the “accrueinadvance” method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities previously one of four acceptable methods included in the aicpa industry audit guide for airlines fsp aug air1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 

we do not believe the adoption of fsp aug air1 will have any impact on our financial position or results of operations we expense planned major maintenance activities at our operating resorts as incurred for our corporate aircraft we apply the “deferral” method of accounting to planned engine overhauls the deferral method is one of the three remaining acceptable methods included in the industry audit guide for airlines under the deferral method the cost of each engine overhaul is capitalized and amortized over the estimated period to the next required overhaul 

market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities 

as of december 31 2006 longterm fixed rate borrowings represented approximately 66 of our total borrowings based on december 31 2006 debt levels an assumed 100 basispoint change in libor would cause our annual interest cost to change by approximately 44 million

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during the quarter ended december 31 2006 we had the following changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect our internal control over financial reporting all of which relate to changes made at mandalay resorts since our acquisition of mandalay in april 2005 

 

in addition to the above significant changes we made other changes to systems policies and processes that were not considered significant for instance mandalay historically used the same general ledger accounting system as we did but we modified the mandalay chart of accounts to make it consistent with ours we also changed mandalay’s banking structure to fit with our legacy structure including moving bank accounts to a consolidated vendor we did not consider these changes or changes of a similar nature to be significant since they are relatively routine when integrating a significant acquisition such as mandalay 

there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect our internal control over financial reporting

operations 

we operate primarily in one segment the operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities giving effect to the mandalay merger over half of our net revenue is now derived from nongaming activities a higher percentage than many of our competitors as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including nongaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality we believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world and a main focus of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain our competitive advantage 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming segment which can cause variability in our results 

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during offpeak times such as midweek or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods which also leads to better labor utilization 

all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours each day every day of the year with the exception of grand victoria which operates 22 hours a day every day of the year our primary casino operations are owned and managed by us other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee or leased to third parties we generally have an operating philosophy that prefers ownership of amenities since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience however we do lease space to retail and food and beverage operators in certain situations particularly for branding opportunities we also operate many “managed” outlets utilizing third party management for specific expertise in areas such as restaurants and nightclubs as well as for branding opportunities since we believe that the number of walkin customers also affects the success of our casino resorts we design our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other hotels 

we utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations we are in the process of combining our players club with mandalay’s one club program when the process is complete players club will link our major resorts and consolidate all slots and table games activity for customers with a players club account under the combined program customers will qualify for benefits across all of these resorts regardless of where they play we believe that our players club enables us to more effectively market to our customers a significant portion of the slot machines at our resorts operate with international game technology’s ezpay™ cashless gaming system including the mandalay resorts where we recently converted many of the slot machines to ezpay™ we believe that this system enhances the customer experience and increases the revenue potential of our slot machines 

technology is a critical part of our strategy in nongaming operations and administrative areas as well our hotel systems include yield management modules which allow us to maximize occupancy and room rates additionally these systems capture most charges made by our customers during their stay including allowing customers of any of our resorts to charge meals and services at other mgm mirage resorts to their hotel accounts we are implementing a new hotel management system at all our resorts in 2006 and 2007 which we expect will enhance our guest service and improve our yield management across our portfolio of resorts 

marketing and competition 

general 

our casino resorts generally operate in highly competitive environments we compete against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality and leisure and business travel companies our primary methods of competing successfully in a competitive environment include 

 

customers and competition 

our las vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotelcasinos in the las vegas area including major hotelcasinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotelcasinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major facilities elsewhere in the las vegas area according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 133200 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2005 up 1 from approximately 131500 rooms at december 31 2004 las vegas visitor volume was 386 million in 2005 a 3 increase from the 374 million reported for 2004 the principal segments of the las vegas gaming market are leisure travel premium gaming customers conventions including small meetings and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel our highend properties which include bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for ti new yorknew york luxor and monte carlo is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome wagerers largely from the leisure travel and to a lesser extent the tour and travel segments excalibur and circus circus las vegas generally cater to the valueoriented and middleincome leisure travel and tour and travel segments 

outside las vegas our other whollyowned nevada operations including those in reno and laughlin compete with each other and with many other similar sized and larger operations a significant portion of our customers at these resorts come from california we believe the expansion of native american gaming has had a negative impact on all of our nevada resorts not located on the las vegas strip and the anticipated additional expansion in california could have a further adverse effect on these resorts our nevada resorts not located in las vegas appeal primarily to middleincome customers attracted by room food and beverage and entertainment prices that are lower than those offered by major las vegas hotelcasinos our target customer for these resorts is the valueoriented leisure traveler and the valueoriented local customer 

outside nevada our whollyowned resorts mainly compete for customers in local gaming markets where location is a critical success factor in tunica mississippi one of our competitors is closer to memphis the area’s principal market in addition we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region for instance in detroit michigan we also compete with a casino in nearby windsor canada in biloxi mississippi we also compete with regional riverboat and landbased casinos in louisiana native american casinos in central mississippi the south florida leisure market and with casinos in the bahamas 

our unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets and in some cases against our whollyowned operations much like our whollyowned resorts our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts 

our company’s facilities also compete for gaming customers with hotelcasino operations located in other areas of the united states and other parts of the world and for leisure and business travelers with nongaming tourist destinations such as hawaii florida and cruise ships our hotelcasinos compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states 

marketing 

we advertise on radio television and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states and overseas as well as on the internet and by direct mail we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major united states and foreign cities a key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention segment we maintain internet websites which inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms and make restaurant and show reservations we also operate call centers to allow customer contact by phone to make hotel restaurant and show reservations 

we utilize our worldclass golf courses in marketing programs at our las vegas strip and other nevada resorts our major las vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at shadow creek in connection with our marketing activities we also invite our premium gaming customers to play shadow creek on a complimentary basis we use primm valley golf club for marketing purposes at our las vegas and primm resorts including offering room and golf packages at special rates 

competitive risks 

the principal negative factors relating to our competitive position are 

 

control over gaming activities 

general 

in connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements these controls include 

 

issuance of markers 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at certain of those casinos as well 

we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation a significant portion of our company’s accounts receivable for amounts unpaid resulting from markers which are not collectible through banking channels is owed by major casino customers from the far east the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries 

in nevada mississippi michigan and illinois amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are enforceable under state laws all other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts owed for markers entered into in nevada mississippi illinois or michigan which are not timely paid pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states 

employees and labor relations 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 54500 fulltime and 12000 parttime employees at that date we had collective bargaining contracts with unions covering approximately 29000 of our employees we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulation and licensing 

the gaming industry is highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located these laws rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility financial stability and character of the owners managers and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions a more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in exhibit 99 to this annual report on form 10k which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 

our businesses are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters employees currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted material changes new laws or regulations or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results

the consolidated complaint claims that we and the other defendants have engaged in a course of fraudulent and misleading conduct intended to induce people to play video poker and electronic slot machines based on a false belief concerning how the gaming machines operate as well as the chances of winning specifically the plaintiffs allege that the gaming machines are not truly random as advertised to the public but are preprogrammed in a predictable and manipulative manner the complaint alleges violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act as well as claims of common law fraud unjust enrichment and negligent misrepresentation and asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages in december 1997 the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim and ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint which they filed in february 1998 we along with most of the other defendants answered the amended complaint and continue to deny the allegations contained in the amended complaint the parties have fully briefed the issues regarding class certification which are currently pending before the court 

in june 2002 the us district court in nevada ruled that the plaintiffs met certain prerequisite requirements for class action status but the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class action certification on the grounds that the proposed class lacked the cohesiveness required to settle common claims against the casino industry the court had previously stayed discovery pending resolution of these class certification issues in august 2004 the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court’s ruling denying class action status for the case in november 2004 the district court set a discovery deadline of april 2005 and trial in september 2005 after plaintiffs’ dismissal of certain operator and cruise ship defendants the remaining defendants in april 2005 filed dispositive motions for summary judgment in september 2005 the district court entered an order granting summary judgment to all defendants that remained in the case on all of plaintiffs’ claims dismissed the case in its entirety and entered judgment in favor of defendants in october 2005 plaintiffs filed an appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals of the judgment granting summary judgment to defendants and of two prior discovery orders that had been entered in the case the appeal remains pending

in june 2000 the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted the plaintiff appealed the ruling to the nevada supreme court the parties filed briefs with the nevada supreme court and oral arguments were conducted in october 2001 in february 2003 the nevada supreme court overturned the district court’s order granting our motion to dismiss the complaint and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on the elements of the lawsuit involving wrongful conduct in approving the merger andor in the valuation of the merged corporation’s shares the nevada supreme court affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims for lost profits and mismanagement the nevada supreme court’s ruling relates only to the district court’s ruling on our motion to dismiss and is not a determination of the merits of the plaintiff’s case the plaintiff filed an amended complaint and in november 2003 the district court certified the action as a class action 

in march 2005 the district court for clark county nevada granted summary judgment in our favor in may 2005 plaintiffs filed an appeal of the dismissal to the nevada supreme court at a mediation conference mandated by court rule the parties reached a settlement agreement on terms favorable to us which is in the process of documentation and is subject to final approval by the nevada supreme court

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

  current operations 

at december 31 2005 our operations consisted of 24 whollyowned casino resorts and 50 investments in three other casino resorts including 

 

other operations include the shadow creek golf course in north las vegas two golf courses at primm valley a 50 investment in the signature at mgm grand a condominiumhotel development adjacent to mgm grand las vegas and a 50 investment in mgm grand paradise limited which is constructing a casino resort in macau 

  mandalay acquisition 

on april 25 2005 we closed our merger with mandalay resort group “mandalay” under which we acquired mandalay for 71 in cash for each share of common stock of mandalay the total acquisition cost of 73 billion included equity value of approximately 48 billion the assumption or repayment of outstanding mandalay debt with a fair value of approximately 29 billion and 01 billion of transaction costs offset by the 05 billion received by mandalay from the sale of its interest in motorcity casino in detroit michigan 

the mandalay acquisition expands our portfolio of resorts on the las vegas strip provides additional sites for future development and expands our employee and customer bases significantly these factors result in the recognition of certain intangible assets and significant goodwill the purchase price allocation is preliminary and may be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition in particular we are still evaluating certain customer relationship intangible assets related to individual and group hotel reservations as well as gaming loyalty program members we did not incur any significant employee termination costs or other exit costs in connection with the mandalay acquisition 

  key performance indicators 

we operate primarily in one segment the operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities giving effect to the mandalay merger over half of our net revenue is now derived from nongaming activities a higher percentage than many of our competitors as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including nongaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality we believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world and a main focus of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain our competitive advantage 

as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming segment which can cause variability in our results key performance indicators related to revenue are 

 

 

most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 

we generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our resorts in las vegas nevada which exposes us to certain risks outside of our control such as competition from other recently opened las vegas resorts including several expanded resorts and a major new competitor and the impact from expansion of gaming in california we are also exposed to risks related to tourism and the general economy including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events 

our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year our results do not depend on key individual customers though our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers or the financial health of customer groups such as business travelers or highend gaming customers from a particular country or region can impact our results 

  overall outlook 

we have invested heavily in our existing operations in the past three years and expect to continue to do so on a targeted basis in 2006 our las vegas strip resorts require ongoing capital investment to maintain their competitive advantages we believe these investments in additional nongaming amenities have enhanced our ability to generate increased visitor volume and allowed us to charge premium prices for our amenities 

the most likely significant factors affecting operating results at our existing resorts in 2006 will be the addition of mandalay the expected continued positive impact of our targeted capital improvements and the completion of towers 1 and 2 of the signature at mgm grand the mandalay acquisition will continue to affect yearoveryear comparisons through april 2006 as a result of the net revenues and operating income of these resorts which includes the impact on depreciation and amortization expense of recognizing depreciable real property and amortizable intangible assets at fair value and additional interest expense as a result of financing the merger through borrowings under our senior credit facility additionally ongoing impacts of cost savings and revenue enhancements will positively affect earnings throughout 2006 

some of the capital improvements we made in 2005 were made towards the end of the year so 2006 will be the first full year of results including these improvements particularly at the mirage where the jet nightclub and several restaurants were added at or near yearend in addition this resort will benefit from the beatlesthemed show by cirque du soleil expected to open in mid2006 these improvements along with improvements at other resorts are expected to drive continued increases in revpar and increased customer volumes in gaming areas restaurants shops entertainment venues and our other resort amenities 

towers 1 and 2 of the signature at mgm grand are expected to be completed in the second and fourth quarters of 2006 respectively at that time we will recognize our share of the venture’s net income which will consist of the sales and costs associated with the sales of the condominium units along with deferred profit from our contribution of land to the venture within “income from unconsolidated affiliates” in the consolidated statement of income upon completion of each tower we will have the opportunity to rent the condominiums to third parties on behalf of owners who elect to have us do so providing a potential ongoing revenue stream 

  financial statement impact of hurricane katrina 

beau rivage sustained significant damage in late august 2005 as a result of hurricane katrina and has been closed since we expect to reopen beau rivage in the third quarter of 2006 although some of the resort’s rooms restaurants and other amenities will not reopen until the fourth quarter the company maintains insurance covering both property damage and business interruption as a result of the storm the deductible under this coverage is approximately 15 million based on the amount of damage incurred based on current estimates insurance proceeds are expected to exceed the net book value of damaged assets therefore the company will not record an impairment charge related to the storm and upon ultimate settlement of the claim will likely record a gain the damaged assets have been written off and a corresponding insurance receivable classified within “other longterm assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets has been recorded 

business interruption coverage covers lost profits and other costs incurred during the period of closure and up to six months following the reopening of the facility the costs expected to be incurred during the interruption period are less than the anticipated business interruption proceeds therefore poststorm costs are being offset by the expected recoveries all poststorm costs and expected recoveries are recorded net within “general and administrative” expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income except for depreciation of nondamaged assets which is classified as “depreciation and amortization” 

results of operations 

  summary financial results 

the following table summarizes our financial results 

 

references to “samestore” results throughout management’s discussion and analysis exclude the mandalay resorts and monte carlo for all periods samestore results also exclude beau rivage for all periods 

on a consolidated basis the most important factors and trends contributing to our performance over the last three years have been 

 

as a result of the above trends our net revenues increased 53 in 2005 and 11 on a samestore basis operating margins were relatively flat with 2004 – 21 in 2005 compared to 22 in 2004 the 2004 margin was a significant increase over the 18 operating margin in 2003 see further discussion of operating income and operating margins in “operating results” below the increase in income from continuing operations generally resulted from the increased operating income offset in part by increased interest expense discussed below in “nonoperating results” 

  operating results 

the following table includes key information about our operating results 

 

the 2005 increase in net revenues resulted from the addition of mandalay and an 11 increase in samestore net revenues samestore net revenues increased largely as a result of strong room pricing and increased volumes in slots and across all nongaming areas these trends were particularly prominent at bellagio and mgm grand las vegas as a result of new and expanded amenities at those resorts 

the 2004 increase in net revenues was largely due to strong room pricing increased gaming volumes and the impact of targeted capital investments in 2003 and 2004 at new yorknew york and mgm grand las vegas 

in 2005 operating income did not increase to the same extent as net revenues largely due to already strong operating margins a lowerthannormal bad debt provision in 2004 higher corporate expense and higher preopening restructuring and property transactions net this resulted in an operating margin of 21 versus 22 in 2004 corporate expense increased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to merger integration costs 

our operating income in 2004 increased 36 due primarily to the strong revenue trends and a full year of borgata’s results the increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates was responsible for approximately onethird of the increase in operating income while improvements at our operating resorts particularly bellagio mgm grand las vegas and new yorknew york made up the rest of the increase operating income at mgm grand detroit was essentially flat in 2004 compared to 2003 despite an increase in the gaming tax rate from 18 to 24 effective september 2004 

we expect operating margins to stay relatively consistent with current levels in 2006 anticipated revenue gains at mandalay resorts and continued realization of merger cost savings will offset typical increases in labor costs the additional 2 gaming tax payable to the city of detroit beginning january 1 2006 and the inclusion of stock compensation expense see “recently issued accounting standards” 

  operating results – detailed revenue information 

the following table presents detail of our net revenues 

 

table games revenue including baccarat was flat on a samestore basis in 2005 a 4 increase in table games volume was offset by a slightly lower hold percentage though hold percentages were within our normal range for all three years presented in 2004 table games volume increased 9 with particular strength in baccarat volume up 18 in both 2005 and 2004 key events such as new year chinese new year and other marketing events were wellattended 

slots revenue increased 8 on a samestore basis following a 9 increase in 2004 additional volume in 2005 was generated by the spa tower at bellagio — bellagio’s slots revenue increased over 30 — and the traffic generated by kÀ and other amenities at mgm grand las vegas where slots revenue increased almost 10 in both periods we benefited from the continued success of our players club affinity program and marketing events targeted at repeat customers 

hotel revenue increased 19 on a samestore basis in 2005 we had more rooms available as a result of the bellagio expansion and 2004 room remodel activity at mgm grand las vegas and our companywide samestore revpar increased 13 to 140 this was on top of a 10 increase in 2004 over 2003 the increase in revpar in 2005 was entirely ratedriven as samestore occupancy was consistent at 92 the 2004 increase was also largely ratedriven 

other nongaming revenue was also up in 2005 with kÀ leading to a 35 increase in samestore entertainment revenue and several new restaurants and bars at mgm grand las vegas bellagio ti and the mirage leading to a 14 increase in samestore food and beverage revenue these results followed similar trends experienced in 2004 compared to 2003 we expect these increases to continue in 2006 as we will open a new beatlesthemed cirque du soleil show at the mirage along with more new restaurants and lounges across our resort portfolio including the recently opened jet nightclub and several restaurants at the mirage 

  operating results – details of certain charges 

preopening and startup expenses consisted of the following 

 

preopening and startup expenses at mgm grand macau relate to our share of the operating results of that venture prior to its opening preopening and startup expenses related to borgata represent our share of the operating results of borgata prior to its july 2003 opening we expect preopening and startup expenses for project citycenter and mgm grand macau to increase in 2006 in addition we will incur preopening and startup expenses related to the permanent facility at mgm grand detroit and the new beatlesthemed show by cirque du soleil at the mirage 

restructuring costs credit consisted of the following 

 

there were no material restructuring activities in 2005 at december 31 2005 there were no material restructuring accruals all material restructuring costs have been fully paid or otherwise resolved 

in 2004 restructuring costs include 3 million for contract termination costs related to the aqua restaurant at bellagio and 2 million of workforce reduction costs at mgm grand detroit as a result of our efforts to minimize the impact of a gaming tax increase in michigan 

in 2003 restructuring costs included 2 million related to the closure of the siegfried  roy show primarily for severance costs of employees involved in the show’s production also we terminated a restaurant lease and closed two marketing offices resulting in 4 million of contract termination charges other severance of 1 million in 2003 related primarily to restructuring of table games staffing at several resorts 

property transactions net consisted of the following 

 

in 2005 recognized impairments relate primarily to assets removed from service in connection with new capital projects at several resorts including bellagio ti the mirage and mandalay bay the amount of the impairments was based on the net book value of the disposed assets abandoned projects included individually insignificant projects at several resorts demolition costs related primarily to room remodel activity at mgm grand las vegas and the new showroom at the mirage 

in 2004 there were no material unusual property transactions in 2003 we sold 315 acres of land in north las vegas nevada near shadow creek for approximately 55 million resulting in the 37 million gain reflected above also in 2003 we recorded writedowns and impairments of assets abandoned or replaced with new construction primarily at mgm grand las vegas in preparation for new restaurants and the kÀ theatre demolition costs in 2004 and 2003 related primarily to preparation for the bellagio standard room remodel bellagio expansion and kÀ theatre at mgm grand las vegas 

  nonoperating results 

the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt 

 

interest cost was higher in 2005 due to the funding of the cash consideration in the mandalay acquisition through senior credit facility borrowings and the assumption of debt in the mandalay acquisition while variable market interest rates continued to increase in 2005 our effective interest rate decreased due to a more normalized ratio of variable rate debt in 2005 our variable interest rate under our senior credit facility has been lower than the interest rates on our fixedrate borrowings capitalized interest increased in 2005 as we began capitalizing interest on project citycenter and our investment in mgm grand paradise limited we expect capitalized interest to increase in 2006 as we will start capitalizing interest on a longer portion of the land related to project city center and as we spend more on the construction of project citycenter 

interest cost was higher in 2004 as we had a higher average borrowing rate due to increases in variable interest rates and the issuance of significant fixed rate debt in the second half of 2004 in anticipation of the mandalay merger capitalized interest increased in 2004 due to the ongoing bellagio expansion and kÀ theatre projects offset partially by the cessation of interest capitalization on our investment in borgata in july 2003 

nonoperating items from unconsolidated affiliates primarily our share of interest expense at borgata and silver legacy and state income taxes at borgata increased from 12 million in 2004 to 16 million in 2005 borgata’s lower interest expense was largely offset by the addition of silver legacy’s interest expense and the remaining decrease resulted from a reduction in state income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2004 at borgata as a result of recording the benefit of certain investment tax credits in 2004 nonoperating items from unconsolidated affiliates was higher than 2003 12 million versus 10 million due to the full year of borgata’s results offset by the reduction to state income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2004 described above 

the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes 

 

the effective income tax rate in 2005 was lower than in 2004 due primarily to a tax benefit realized from the repatriation of foreign earnings from australia as a result of the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 that provided for a special onetime deduction of 85 percent on certain repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries additionally in 2004 the company accrued additional state deferred taxes related to capital investments in new jersey and incurred nondeductible costs related to a michigan ballot initiative neither of these items recurred in 2005 

the effective income tax rate in 2004 was higher than in 2003 primarily due to the additional new jersey taxes and nondeductible michigan ballot initiative costs discussed above as well as overseas development costs for which no tax benefit was provided and the reversal of a greater amount of tax reserves in 2003 compared to 2004 as a result of completion of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations 

in 2005 taxes paid decreased from 2004 in part due to increased tax benefits from stock option exercises and onetime benefit plan deductions partially offset by decreased accelerated tax depreciation deductions and increased pretax income in addition a federal tax overpayment from 2004 was applied to 2005 reducing the 2005 tax payments in 2004 taxes paid increased from 2003 primarily due to increased pretax income and the full utilization of tax credit carryforwards in 2003 we expect cash paid for income taxes to increase significantly in 2006 due to the required payment of taxes on the gain on mandalay’s sale of motorcity casino required tax payments on the income associated with towers 1 and 2 of the signature at mgm grand and continued increases in income resulting from the mandalay merger and continued improvements in operating results 

liquidity and capital resources 

  cash flows – summary 

our cash flows consisted of the following 

 

  cash flows – operating activities 

trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income excluding noncash charges since our business is primarily cashbased cash flow from operations has increased in each of the last two years due to higher operating income offset by higher combined interest and tax payments

  other factors affecting liquidity 

  distributions from the signature at mgm grand  as discussed earlier towers 1 and 2 of the signature at mgm grand are expected to be completed in the second and fourth quarters of 2006 respectively we expect to receive distributions totaling at least 100 million upon completion of these towers 

  longterm debt payable in 2006  we repaid 200 million of longterm debt at maturity in february 2006 with available borrowings under our senior credit facility another 245 million of longterm debt matures later in 2006 

  project citycenter  in november 2004 we announced a plan to develop a multibillion dollar urban metropolis project citycenter on 66 acres of land on the las vegas strip between bellagio and monte carlo project citycenter will feature a 4000room casino resort designed by worldfamous architect cesar pelli two 400room boutique hotels one of which will be managed by luxury hotelier mandarin oriental approximately 470000 square feet of retail shops dining and entertainment venues and approximately 23 million square feet of residential space in over 2900 luxury condominium and condominiumhotel units in multiple towers 

as currently contemplated we believe project citycenter will cost approximately 7 billion excluding preopening and land costs after estimated proceeds of 25 billion from the sale of residential units we believe the net project cost will be approximately 45 billion we expect to complete the design work for project citycenter in mid2006 and expect the project to open in 2009 the design budget and schedule of project citycenter are still preliminary and the ultimate timing cost and scope of project citycenter are subject to risks attendant to largescale projects 

  detroit permanent casino  mgm grand detroit llc has operated an interim casino facility in downtown detroit since july 1999 in august 2002 the detroit city council approved revised development agreements with our subsidiary and two other developers the revised development agreement released us and the city from certain of the obligations under the original agreement and significantly changed other provisions of the original agreement 

in april 2005 the 6 th circuit court of appeals lifted its injunction prohibiting commencement of construction of the permanent hotel and casino complexes we have obtained land and began construction on our permanent facility which will be located near the site of our interim facility the permanent facility is expected to open in late 2007 at a cost of 765 million including land and preopening costs and will feature a 400room hotel 100000square foot casino numerous restaurant and entertainment amenities and spa and convention facilities the complete design timing and cost of the permanent facility are at a preliminary stage and are subject to risks attendant to largescale projects

  beau rivage rebuilding  we have already begun the process of rebuilding beau rivage damage was extensive on the main levels of the resort largely destroying the casino floor and gaming equipment the resort’s restaurants the retail area and a portion of the parking garage there was also damage though to a lesser extent in the hotel tower we expect to reopen the resort in stages beginning in the third quarter of 2006 when fully reopened beau rivage will include 1740 guestrooms over 2000 slot machines and 90 table games new and restored restaurants a stateoftheart convention center and pool and spa amenities 

we believe that a large portion of the costs to rebuild beau rivage will be covered under our insurance policies however we cannot determine the exact amount of reimbursement until we submit our claims and receive notice of approval from our insurers it is also uncertain as to the timing of such reimbursements and we have been funding the rebuilding costs in advance of receiving reimbursements from our insurers 

  new york racing association  we have entered into a definitive agreement with the new york racing association “nyra” to manage video lottery terminals “vlts” at nyra’s aqueduct horseracing facility in metropolitan new york we will assist in the development of the approximately 170 million facility including providing project financing and will manage the facility for a term of five years extended automatically if the financing provided by us is not fully repaid for a fee recent legislative changes will allow us to operate the vlts past the expiration date of the current nyra franchise agreement 

  off balance sheet arrangements 

our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which currently consist primarily of our investments in borgata grand victoria silver legacy mgm grand macau and the signature at mgm grand we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we provided a guaranty for up to 50 of the interest and principal payment obligations on the construction financing for the first two towers of the signature at mgm grand otherwise we have not guaranteed financing obtained by our investees nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort 

at december 31 2005 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 53 million of which 50 million support bonds issued by the economic development corporation of the city of detroit these bonds are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets this obligation was undertaken to secure our right to develop a permanent casino in detroit 

  commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december 31 2005 

 

 

   summary of expected sources and uses of funds 

in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above other significant operating uses of cash in 2006 include tax payments other significant investing uses of cash flow in 2006 include uncommitted capital expenditures expected to be approximately 850 million excluding capitalized interest and spending at beau rivage 

we plan to fund our contractual obligations and other estimated spending through a combination of operating cash flow distributions from the signature at mgm grand available borrowings under our senior credit facility and potential issuances of fixed rate longterm debt we generated almost 12 billion in operating cash flow in 2005 which included deductions for interest payments tax payments and certain contractually committed payments reflected in the above table including operating leases employment agreements and entertainment agreements we expect to generate a higher level of operating cash flow in 2006 due primarily to the continued impact of the mandalay acquisition as well as expected increases in operating income at other resorts 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 

marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas mandalay bay and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well 

we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states at december 31 2005 and 2004 approximately 44 and 54 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states at december 31 2005 and 2004 approximately 42 and 25 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east 

we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 

the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur 

the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables 

 

the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the last two years particularly in 2004 as a result of improved collections leading to improved credit statistics our reserve percentages for 2004 and 2005 are consistent with the percentage before the september 11 2001 attacks and are representative of a more normalized collection experience and positive global economic conditions relative to the conditions in 2001 and 2002 

at december 31 2005 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by 15 million or less than 001 per share 

  fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies 

property and equipment are stated at cost for the majority of our property and equipment cost has been determined based on estimated fair values in connection with the mandalay acquisition and the may 2000 mirage resorts acquisition maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets we account for construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries 

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 34 “capitalization of interest cost” “sfas 34” interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities as defined in sfas 34 begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

whether we capitalize interest on a project depends in part on management’s actions in november 2004 we announced the development of project citycenter in las vegas in connection with this announcement and the start of design activities we began capitalizing interest associated with this project including capitalizing interest on land costs for the portion of the project citycenter site not currently being utilized in operations interest capitalized on this project for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2005 was 2 million and 12 million respectively 

  impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” for assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset typically measured using a discounted cash flow model if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses 

there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets when appropriate we discount future cash flows using our weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model whenever an impairment loss is recorded or a test for impairment is made we discuss the facts and circumstances with the audit committee 

see “results of operations” for discussion of writedowns and impairments recorded in 2003 2004 and 2005 in june 2003 we entered into an agreement to sell the golden nugget subsidiaries the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated in february 2004 we entered into an agreement to sell mgm grand australia the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated other than the above items we are not aware of events or circumstances that would cause us to review any material longlived assets for impairment 

  income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” sfas 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied 

as reflected in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements at december 31 2005 we had 126 million of deferred tax assets and 34 billion of deferred tax liabilities except for certain new jersey state net operating losses certain other new jersey state deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income the valuation allowance at december 31 2005 related to the new jersey and foreign deferred tax assets were 6 million and 2 million respectively 

our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities while positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws we do not take such positions unless we have “substantial authority” to do so under the internal revenue code and applicable regulations we may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority that are not ultimately accepted by the irs 

we assess such potential unfavorable outcomes based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “sfas 5” we establish a tax reserve if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the unfavorable outcome can be reasonably estimated we assess the potential outcomes of tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis in determining whether the probable criterion of sfas 5 is met we presume that the taxing authority will focus on the exposure and we assess the probable outcome of a particular issue based upon the relevant legal and technical merits we also apply our judgment regarding the potential actions by the tax authorities and resolution through the settlement process 

we maintain required tax reserves until such time as the underlying issue is resolved when actual results differ from reserve estimates we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period resolved for tax years that are examined by taxing authorities we adjust tax reserves in the year the tax examinations are settled for tax years that are not examined by taxing authorities we adjust tax reserves in the year that the statute of limitations expires our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 

during 2003 we filed amended returns for tax years subsequent to 1996 to reflect the impact of the irs audits of the 1993 through 1996 tax years on those subsequent years in the fourth quarter of 2003 the statutes of limitations expired for the 1997 through 1999 tax years resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of 13 million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2004 the statute of limitations expired for our 2000 tax return resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of 6 million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes the irs is currently auditing our 2001 and 2002 tax returns and the tax returns for years after 2002 are subject to possible future examination 

we classify reserves for tax uncertainties within “other accrued liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets separate from any related income tax payable or deferred income taxes reserve amounts may relate to the deductibility of an item as well as potential interest associated with those items 

a portion of our tax reserves was assumed in the mirage resorts and mandalay acquisitions the irs audit of the tax returns of mirage resorts through the merger date was settled in august 2003 resulting in a payment to the irs of 45 million including interest these matters had been previously reserved for so the settlement had no impact on our goodwill balances any future adjustments to the acquired mirage resorts and mandalay tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 

  business combinations 

we account for business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “accounting for business combinations” “sfas 141” and statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “accounting tor goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” and related interpretations sfas 141 requires that we record the net assets of acquired businesses at fair value and we must make estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities 

in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in the mandalay acquisition we hired thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us with certain fair value estimates primarily related to land property and equipment and intangible assets we and the thirdparty specialist applied significant judgment and utilized a variety of assumptions in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities including market data estimated future cash flows growth rates current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets market rate assumptions for contractual obligations and settlement plans for contingencies and liabilities 

the mandalay purchase price allocation is preliminary and may be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition in particular the company is still evaluating certain customer relationship intangible assets related to individual and group hotel reservations as well as gaming loyalty program members changes to the assumptions we used to estimate fair value could impact the recorded amounts for acquired assets and assumed liabilities and significant changes to these balances could have a material impact to our future reported results for instance lower or higher fair values assigned to property plant and equipment and certain amortizable intangible assets could result in lower or higher amounts of depreciation and amortization recorded 

recently issued accounting standards 

  stockbased compensation 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb statement no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” under the original standard sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas 123” companies had the option of recording stock options issued to employees at fair value or intrinsic value which generally leads to no expense being recorded most companies including us opted to use this intrinsic value method and make required disclosures of fair value expense sfas 123r eliminates this intrinsic value alternative sfas 123r was effective for us on january 1 2006 and all future sharebased payments must be recorded at fair value the following are the key impacts and decisions regarding implementation of sfas 123r 

  valuation model  under sfas 123 stock options were generally valued using the blackscholes model sfas 123r does not specify which model must be used but requires that certain assumptions be included in the chosen model which may be a closed form model such as the blackscholes model or a binomial model we have chosen to continue applying the blackscholes model 

  vesting patterns  under sfas 123r awards with graded vesting as all of our awards have may be expensed in one of two time patterns 1 on a straightline basis over the complete vesting period as though the entire award was one grant or 2 on an accelerated basis treating each vesting layer as a separate grant and amortizing each layer on a straightline basis for disclosure purposes under sfas 123 we used the accelerated basis we will use the straightline method for future grants under sfas 123r as discussed below under transition methods such policy will only apply to future grants expense recognized under sfas 123r for previously granted options will continue to be recorded on the accelerated basis 

  estimating forfeitures  under sfas 123 we could choose whether to estimate forfeitures at the grant date or recognize actual forfeitures as they occur under sfas 123r we must estimate forfeitures as of the grant date 

  presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows  under sfas 123r the excess of tax benefits realized from the exercise of employee stock options over the tax benefit associated with the financial reporting expense is shown as a financing cash inflow in the statement of cash flows previously these excess benefits were shown as an operating cash inflow 

  transition  there are two allowable transition alternatives – the modifiedprospective transition or the modifiedretrospective transition we will apply the modifiedprospective transition under the modifiedprospective transition we will begin applying the valuation and other criteria to stock options granted beginning january 1 2006 we will begin recognizing expense for the unvested portion of previously issued grants at the same time based on the valuation and attribution methods originally used to calculate the disclosures 

the impact of adopting sfas 123r on our operating results will depend in part on the amount of stock options or other sharebased payments we grant in the future the following table shows compensation expense net of tax related to options granted through december 31 2005 based on the options’ vesting schedules 

 

we do not believe the adoption of sfas 123r will have a material impact on our cash flows or financial position 

  rental costs incurred during a construction period 

in october 2005 the financial accounting standards board issued staff position fas 131 “accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period” “fsp fas 131” fsp fas 131 requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period be expensed prevalent practice in real estate and hospitality industries had been to capitalize such rental costs during a construction period as a project cost 

fsp fas 131 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 with early adoption permitted we will adopt fsp fas 131 in the first quarter of 2006 we do not believe that the adoption of fsp fas 131 will have a material impact on our cash flows or financial position we have historically not had significant leases during construction we will have some minor leases in connection with project citycenter and mgm grand paradise limited will have a land lease for the project site in macau 

market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities 

as of december 31 2005 longterm fixed rate borrowings represented approximately 61 of our total borrowings based on december 31 2005 debt levels an assumed 100 basispoint change in libor would cause our annual interest cost to change by approximately 48 million

recent developments 

  

merger with loc acquisition company  on september 23 2004 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with loc acquisition company a delaware corporation owned by a consortium comprised of sony corporation of america providence equity partners texas pacific group comcast corporation and dlj merchant banking partners under the agreement the consortium will acquire mgm for 1200 in cash per share of our common stock plus the assumption of our debt completion of the merger is subject to various regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions jp morgan chase and credit suisse first boston have committed to provide the consortium with up to 425 billion of senior debt financing the consortium’s obligation to acquire mgm is conditioned upon consummation of the debt financing on the terms set forth in the commitment letters delivered by jp morgan chase and credit suisse first boston or substitute financing which if the debt financing commitments become unavailable the consortium is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain mgm’s stockholders approved the merger at a special meeting held on december 17 2004 in connection with merger agreement tracinda and 250 rodeo inc voted all of their shares of mgm common stock in favor of the merger 

  

in connection with the merger agreement we and sony entered into a deposit agreement dated as of september 13 2004 as amended pursuant to which sony paid us a 150 million deposit under the deposit agreement we must return the deposit to sony at the effective time of the merger otherwise the deposit is nonrefundable unless 1 the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances where we are required to pay a termination fee to loc acquisition company provided that if the merger agreement is terminated by loc acquisition company because a our board withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to loc acquisition 

  

company its recommendation that our stockholders adopt the merger agreement or recommends approves or adopts an alternative takeover proposal or b we fail to include in the proxy statement relating to the merger or any amendment the recommendation of our board that our stockholders vote in favor of the merger or c a third party commences a tender or exchange offer for mgm and our board does not recommend rejection of the offer within ten business days or d our board approves or recommends an alternative takeover proposal or approves or recommends that its stockholders tender their shares in any tender or exchange offer the deposit is only refundable if we enter into a binding agreement with a third party with respect to an alternative takeover proposal within nine months of termination of the merger agreement or 2 a court has determined that there has been material adverse effect with respect to mgm 

  

in addition if loc acquisition company terminates the merger agreement because we have breached any of our covenants such that the conditions to closing cannot be satisfied and there is a final binding judgment of a court that we willfully and materially breached the merger agreement as to which all rights of appeal or other avenues of review have been exhausted or lapsed then the amount of the deposit may be taken into account in determining any damages resulting from our willful and material breach 

  

in addition in connection with the merger agreement we entered into an indemnity agreement with tracinda 250 rodeo and mr kerkorian pursuant to which we will indemnify tracinda 250 rodeo and mr kerkorian against certain liabilities relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 

  

the merger presently is expected to close shortly after the end of the first quarter of 2005 however there can be no assurance that all of the conditions to the merger including the conditions within our control will be satisfied or that the merger will be completed 

  

although we have no reason to believe that the merger will not be consummated the pendency of a merger involving a motion picture studio tends to create uncertainty in the entertainment business community as a result it has been more difficult for us to attract development projects attach talent to projects commence productions and implement distribution initiatives in the home video and television sales markets during the progress of merger discussions and the executory period of the merger agreement accordingly in the event that the merger should fail to be consummated there may be a gap or reduction in the number of motion picture releases for a period of time following termination of the merger agreement until we can reinvigorate its development production and distribution activities in addition we could face a loss of personnel or a decline in morale if the merger should fail to be consummated such occurrences could be expected to have at least temporarily a significant adverse effect upon our business in the event that as a result of termination of the merger agreement we retain sony’s 150 million deposit these adverse effects would be mitigated but there is no guarantee that the deposit alone would be sufficient to mitigate the entire negative effect of nonconsummation of the merger 

  

stockholder dividend on april 26 2004 we declared a special onetime cash dividend of 800 per share to stockholders of record on may 7 2004 which was paid on may 17 2004 the cash dividend aggregating approximately 189 billion was financed by borrowings under our new 24 billion credit facility 

  

pursuant to the provisions of the amended and restated 1996 stock incentive plan the compensation committee of the board of directors has adjusted the outstanding stock options issued on or before may 17 2004 under the plan such that following the payment of the onetime cash dividend to stockholders each option holder shall receive upon exercise in addition to the shares of common stock otherwise obtainable a cash amount of 800 per share 

  

new credit facility on april 26 2004 we entered into a fourth amended and restated credit facility with a syndicate of banks aggregating 24 billion consisting of a fiveyear 4000 million revolving credit facility a sixyear 4000 million term loan and a sevenyear 16 billion term loan which replaced a preexisting 175 billion amended credit facility proceeds from the loans under the new credit facility were used to finance the 

  

payment of the 189 billion stockholder dividend see above and to refinance loans under the preexisting credit facility the new revolving credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes the credit agreement provides that certain change of control transactions including a transaction such as the pending merger with loc acquisition company constitute an event of default resulting in acceleration of the loans and termination of the revolving credit facility in connection with the closing of the merger the credit facility will be replaced and superseded by debt financing arranged by the consortium 

  

in february 2002 mgm domestic television distribution llc and nbc enterprises inc formed a joint venture to act as an agent to sell barter advertising spots received by us and nbc as full or partial consideration from the licensing of feature film and television programming product in the domestic television syndication market on september 30 2004 the joint venture was terminated and all distribution agreements were terminated by december 31 2004 we assumed the sale of advertising spots for our programming in the domestic television syndication market 

  

dutch auction tender offer on december 4 2003 we commenced a dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to 10000000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price not greater than 1800 nor less than 1625 per share under the procedures for the dutch auction tender offer our stockholders had the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares of common stock at prices specified by the stockholders we then determined the lowest price per share within the range of 1625 to 1800 per share that would enable us to buy 10000000 shares or such lesser number of shares that were properly tendered and not withdrawn shares accepted in the dutch auction tender offer were purchased by us at the same determined price per share regardless of whether the stockholder tendered at a lower price tracinda group 250 rodeo and mr kerkorian our principal stockholders did not participate in the dutch auction tender offer nor did any member of our board of directors or executive management the dutch auction tender offer expired on january 15 2004 pursuant to the dutch auction tender offer we purchased 10000000 shares of our common stock at a price of 1700 per share or an aggregate amount of 1700 million plus offering expenses of approximately 10 million the dutch auction tender offer was financed primarily from available cash on hand net cash flow provided by operating activities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

  

notice of termination of third party international subdistribution agreement in june 1999 we entered into an agreement with twentieth century fox home entertainment inc pursuant to which fox home entertainment provides distribution services for our films in the international home video market this distribution arrangement became effective on february 1 2000 on june 24 2003 we gave notice to fox home entertainment of our intent to terminate the agreement as of january 31 2004 as permitted under the agreement effective february 1 2004 we entered into an amended agreement under which fox home entertainment will continue to perform subdistribution services in certain territories in 2003 we expanded our sales and marketing operations in western europe adding france and germany to operations already in place in the uk we also added to our north american sales marketing and distribution operations with the addition of canada to our existing us distribution furthermore in early 2004 we took control of all sales marketing and distribution operations in the uk france germany australia and benelux see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

treasury stock  in july 2002 we publicly announced a share repurchase program to purchase up to 10000000 shares of our common stock in the open market using available cash on hand in november 2003 we announced that we had increased the number of shares of our common stock we could purchase in the share repurchase program by an additional 2500000 shares for a total of up to 12500000 shares under this program as of december 31 2004 we had repurchased 8104300 shares at an average price of 1146 per share and at an aggregate cost of 929 million 

  

the motion picture and television industry 

  

motion pictures—general the motion picture industry consists of two principal activities production and distribution production involves the development financing and production of featurelength motion 

  

pictures distribution involves the promotion and exploitation of motion pictures throughout the world in a variety of media including theatrical exhibition home entertainment television and other ancillary markets the us motion picture industry can be divided into major studios and independent companies with the major studios accounting for a large majority of the number of theatrical releases in addition to us including mgm studios mgm pictures ua films and orion the major studios are the walt disney company including buena vista touchstone and miramax films paramount pictures corporation sony pictures entertainment inc including columbia pictures twentieth century fox film corp nbc universal including universal studios and warner bros including new line cinema and castle rock entertainment the major studios are typically large diversified corporations that have strong relationships with creative talent exhibitors and others involved in the entertainment industry and have global film production and distribution capabilities 

  

historically the major studios have produced and distributed the majority of high grossing theatrical motion pictures released annually in the united states in addition most of the studios have created or accumulated substantial and valuable motion picture libraries that generate significant revenues these revenues can provide the major studios with a stable source of earnings that partially offsets the variations in the financial performance of their current motion picture releases and other aspects of their motion picture operations 

  

the independent companies generally have more limited production and distribution capabilities than do the major studios while certain independent companies may produce as many films as a major studio in any year independent motion pictures typically have lower negative costs and are not as widely released as motion pictures produced and distributed by the major studios additionally the independent companies may have limited or no internal distribution capability and may rely on the major studios for distribution and financing 

  

motion picture production the production of a motion picture begins with the screenplay adaptation of a popular novel or other literary work acquired by the producer of the motion picture or the development of an original screenplay based upon a story line or scenario conceived or acquired by the producer in the development phase the producer may seek production financing and tentative commitments from a director the principal cast members and other creative personnel a proposed production schedule and budget are prepared at the end of this phase the decision is made whether or not to “greenlight” or approve for production the motion picture 

  

after greenlighting preproduction of the motion picture begins in this phase the producer engages creative personnel to the extent not previously committed finalizes the filming schedule and production budget obtains insurance or self insures and secures completion guaranties if necessary moreover the producer establishes filming locations secures any necessary studio facilities and stages and prepares for the start of actual filming 

  

principal photography or the actual filming of the screenplay generally extends from seven to 16 weeks depending upon such factors as budget location weather and complications inherent in the screenplay following completion of principal photography the motion picture enters what is typically referred to as postproduction in this phase the motion picture is edited opticals dialogue music and any special effects are added and voice effects and music soundtracks and pictures are synchronized this results in the production of the negative from which release prints of the motion picture are made major studios and independent film companies hire editors composers and special effects technicians on the basis of their suitability for a particular picture 

  

the production and marketing of theatrical motion pictures requires substantial capital the costs of producing and marketing motion pictures have increased substantially in recent years these costs may continue to increase in the future at rates greater than normal inflation thereby increasing the costs to us of our motion pictures production costs and marketing costs are generally rising at a faster rate than increases in either domestic admissions to movie theaters or admission ticket prices leaving us and all producers of motion pictures more dependent on other media such as home entertainment and television and foreign markets 

  

motion picture distribution the distribution of a motion picture involves the licensing of the picture for distribution or exploitation in various markets both domestically and internationally pursuant to a release pattern these markets include theatrical exhibition nontheatrical exhibition which includes airlines hotels and armed forces facilities home entertainment including rental and sellthrough of video and dvd presentation on television including payperview pay network syndication and basic cable and marketing of the other rights in the picture and underlying literary property which may include publishing merchandising and soundtracks the domestic and international markets generally follow the same release pattern with the starting date of the release in the international market varying from being concurrent with the domestic theatrical release to being as long as nine months afterwards a motion picture typically is distributed by a major studio or one or more distributors that acquire rights from a studio or other producer in one or more markets or media or a combination of the foregoing 

  

both major studios and independent film companies often acquire pictures for distribution through a customary industry arrangement known as a “negative pickup” under which the studio or independent film company agrees before commencement of or during production to acquire from a production company all rights to a film upon completion of production and also acquire completed films as well as all associated obligations 

  

television production the production of television series programming involves the development of a format based on a creative concept or literary property into a television script the hiring of talent the filming or taping of the program and the technical and postproduction work necessary to produce a finished program television producers may originate projects internally or acquire them from others if a concept is deemed suitable for development the studio or other producer or network typically commissions and pays for a script once a script is ordered one or more license agreements are negotiated with the potential broadcasters of such program a pilot episode usually is ordered or commissioned prior to the determination of whether a series will be produced 

  

television production can generally be divided into two distinct markets a network production consisting of production for the broadcast networks ie abc cbs nbc fox upn and wb and madeforcable networks ie pay and basic cable networks and b firstrun syndication production the economics of the two types of television production are different in broadcast network and madeforcable network production a network generally orders a minimum number of initial episodes approximately six to 13 episodes if produced for a broadcast network and approximately 13 to 22 episodes if produced for a cable network of each new series for a license fee equal to a percentage of the program’s cost the balance of the production cost for such shows which is customarily lower for madeforcable productions than for productions made for broadcast networks can only be recouped through international sales and if a series is successful syndication second run domestic basic cable and home entertainment sales and generally remains unrecouped for at least four years in the firstrun syndication production business a producer seeking to launch a new series commits to produce a minimum number of episodes if the producer can “clear” the series by selling to individual television stations in sufficient markets throughout the country generally comprising at least 75 percent of us television households once produced the episodes are immediately available for licensing to international broadcasters as well and can subsequently be licensed to a domestic basic cable network this approach generally involves a lower production cost risk and earlier return on investment than the network production business however firstrun syndicated programming generally reduces the potential total return on investment as compared to successful network production see “—production—television production” 

  

television distribution the us television market is served by network affiliated stations independent stations and cable systems although the number of independent stations has decreased as many formerly independent stations have become affiliated with new networks in recent years during “prime time” hours network affiliates primarily broadcast programming produced for the network in nonprime time network affiliates broadcast network programming offnetwork programming firstrun programming programming produced for distribution on a syndicated basis and programming produced by the local stations themselves independent television stations and cable networks during both prime and nonprime time produce their own 

  

programs and telecast offnetwork programs or firstrun programs acquired from independent producers or syndicators syndicators generally are companies that sell to independent television stations and network affiliates programming produced or acquired by the syndicator for distribution 

  

business strategy 

  

our goal has been to become a fullyintegrated global entertainment content company thereby maximizing the value of our assets including our film and television library and our film and television production and distribution units to achieve this goal we have sought to 

  

build and leverage our library we plan to build and leverage our film and television library by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

create branded cable and satellite programming channels we believe we can create significant value by utilizing our library and current production to establish mgm branded cable and satellite channels we have launched channels serving over 100 countries and territories around the globe and have been actively exploring strategic alternatives to gain carriage for additional proposed channels see “—branded cable and satellite channels” 

  

maintain film and television production while improving our risk profile current management intends to conduct our production business in a financially disciplined manner by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

currently we intend to produce or coproduce and distribute seven to ten motion pictures annually through mgm pictures across a variety of genres through ua films we also intend to distribute annually an additional five to ten specialty motion pictures that will have substantially lower average costs and will be produced mainly by third parties 

  

currently we plan to develop produce and distribute television programs focusing in part on low financial risk formats such as preclearing a television series for distribution prior to committing to development expenditures as well as joint ventures coproductions and other partnering arrangements for certain of our series 

  

increase distribution revenues we have taken steps to obtain greater flexibility in distributing our own product to enable us to realize additional revenue opportunities while reducing the costs associated with distribution in 1999 we terminated our agreement with warner home video so that on february 1 2000 we regained full control over the home video exploitation of our films on october 31 2000 we completed our withdrawal from united international pictures uip with respect to the international theatrical distribution of our films we executed the transition of our international home video and theatricalnontheatrical distribution from warner home video and uip to gain more control over our international distribution in those media and to maximize our revenue opportunities 

  

we plan to increase distribution revenues by 

  

   

   

   

   

capitalize on a well recognized brand name we believe that the mgm name and lion logo are among the most recognized in the world we seek to capitalize on the value inherent in our name and logo through the distribution of branded programming and the development of consumer products 

  

impact of merger the foregoing discussion of business strategy was based upon the company’s current status as an independent publiclytraded entity upon and after consummation of the merger agreement with loc acquisition company the company’s business strategy is likely to change significantly 

  

film and television library 

  

we currently own or hold certain distribution rights to approximately 4000 theatrically released motion pictures our library also contains the largest collection of feature films produced since 1948 in 1948 certain major studios negotiated consent decrees requiring that the studios separate their exhibition businesses from their production and distribution businesses and mandating the divestiture of certain theater holdings this is generally believed to have triggered at the time greater competition among the studios and an increased emphasis on the potential for commercial success in the development and production stages resulting in a greater focus on the content and quality of the motion pictures produced and distributed by the studios we believe that films produced and developed after 1948 generally are more valuable than pre1948 films a number of which are black and white 

  

in addition to being the largest modern motion picture library in the world our library is also one of the most critically acclaimed libraries in the motion picture industry representing one of the largest collections of academy awardwinning films the motion pictures in our library have won over 200 academy awards fourteen motion pictures in our library have won the academy award for best picture annie hall the apartment the best years of our lives dances with wolves hamlet in the heat of the night marty midnight cowboy platoon rain man rocky the silence of the lambs tom jones and west side story  

  

our library also includes over 10000 episodes from television series previously broadcast on primetime network television cable or in firstrun syndication including episodes of the addams family american gladiators bat masterson cagney  lacey fame green acres highway patrol in the heat of the night mr ed the patty duke show pink panther sea hunt and thirtysomething programming in our library has won among others 87 emmy awards and 18 golden globe awards 

  

  

our library includes titles from a wide range of genres including dramas comedies actionadventure movies westerns and suspense thrillers we believe that our library’s diversity quality and extensive size provides us with substantial competitive advantages we seek to continue to build upon these advantages by producing and acquiring new motion pictures across a variety of genres and budget ranges to update and enhance our library see “—production—motion picture production” 

  

currently we seek to continue to implement the strategy of developing or licensing the development of new projects from existing library assets our library represents a readilyavailable “market tested” source of development ideas for example in 2005 we are releasing the pink panther  the latest installment in the pink panther franchise beauty shop  a spinoff of the barbershop series and be cool  a sequel to the 1995 film get shorty  we are currently developing yours mine and ours  a remake in a singlepot coproduction with paramount in 2004 we released a remake of walking tall  additionally in 1999 we had success with the remake of the thomas crown affair and in 1995 we had success with the birdcage  a remake of la cage aux folles  furthermore we have successfully expanded the valuable film franchises within our library most notably the james bond franchise with the commercial success of goldeneye in 1995 tomorrow never dies in 1997 the world is not enough in 1999 and die another day in 2002 additionally we have successfully developed television series based on library motion pictures such as poltergeist the legacy based on poltergeist stargate sg1 and stargate atlantis based on stargate and all dogs go to heaven based on the movie of the same name we also have produced a remake of twelve angry men and inherit the wind as madefortelevision movies for showtime networks and carrie as a madefortelevision movie for nbc 

  

we together with danjaq llc are the sole owners of all of the james bond motion pictures twenty james bond motion pictures in our library were produced and are distributed pursuant to a series of agreements with danjaq the james bond motion pictures are produced by danjaq and we have the right to approve all key elements of the pictures such as the selection of the director and the leading actors the copyright in each of the motion pictures is owned jointly by mgm and danjaq historically we have the right to distribute each of the pictures in all media worldwide in perpetuity or for a term of 15 years where our distribution rights are not perpetual the rights revert to joint control by mgm and danjaq after expiration of the distribution term on january 21 2004 we entered into an extension agreement with danjaq under that agreement our distribution term for each of the nonperpetual james bond motion pictures was extended by 15 years from the previously scheduled expiration date and the initial distribution term for new james bond pictures beginning with die another day  was extended from 15 years to 20 years danjaq controls certain merchandising rights with respect to the pictures and we are entitled to receive a portion of the revenues from danjaq’s merchandising licenses additionally we control all the marketing rights and the music from the living daylights 1987 and all subsequent pictures all other rights relating to the pictures are controlled jointly by mgm and danjaq the agreements contain certain restrictions on the sale or licensing by mgm of any of our rights in the pictures 

  

in 1998 we acquired the rights to never say never again  produced by warner bros and taliafilms and in 1999 we acquired the distribution rights to casino royale  produced by columbia and famous artists productions a subsidiary of mgm accordingly our library now contains every james bond motion picture ever made and we are the only studio to hold such rights 

  

we seek aggressively to market and distribute titles in our film library in existing pay and free television home video and other markets worldwide we believe that the size of our library allows us to minimize the overexploitation of any title and therefore better preserve the ongoing value of our library by actively managing the rotation of titles through such markets as of december 31 2004 approximately 80 percent of the theatrical motion picture titles and approximately 92 percent of the television title episodes in our library have been exploited 

  

we also seek aggressively to market and distribute our titles through developing technology see “—distribution—home video distribution” we believe that the development and growth of direct broadcast satellite and other new distribution systems may generate significant incremental profits for the industry as the number of channels requiring content grows 

  

we have differing types of rights to the various titles in our library in some cases we own the title outright with the right to exploit the title in all media and territories for an unlimited time in other cases the title may be owned by a third party and we may have obtained the right to distribute the title in certain media and territories for a limited term even if we own a title we may have granted rights to exploit the title in certain media and territories to others as of december 31 2004 we owned outright or had been granted rights in perpetuity to approximately 67 percent of the titles in our library our rights in the other library titles are limited in time and pursuant to the terms of the existing arrangements the rights granted to us expire with respect to approximately three percent of the library over the next two years ie through the end of 2006 with respect to another approximately 23 percent over the seven years thereafter from 2007 to 2014 and with respect to another approximately seven percent thereafter from 2014 on we have generally been able to renew such rights on acceptable terms however we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so in the future in accordance with industry practice for purposes of calculating the size of the library we include any title that we have the right to distribute in any territory in any media for any term 

  

certain longterm prepaid licenses were entered into before 1993 by a prior management as of december 31 2004 the titles included in these licenses represent a crosssection of the titles in the library including approximately 15 percent of all pre1990 mgm and ua titles which remain under license in one or more of the us france and spain and approximately 15 percent of the orion and polygram titles which remain under license to television in one or more of france spain germany and the united kingdom see “—distribution—television distribution” we expect to benefit as certain rights to the library that have been previously licensed to others revert to us over time see “—distribution” 

  

because we have historically derived approximately 35 to 40 percent of our revenues from nonus sources our business is subject to risks inherent in international trade many of which are beyond our control these risks include changes in laws and policies affecting trade investment and taxes including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and to withholding taxes differing degrees of protection for intellectual property financial instability and increased market concentration of buyers in foreign television markets including in european pay television markets the instability of foreign economies and governments fluctuating foreign exchange rates and war and acts of terrorism see “—regulation” “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

  

production 

  

motion picture production 

  

we currently develop and produce theatrical motion picture projects through two separate production entities mgm pictures and ua films mgm pictures concentrates on developing and producing mainstream major studio budget level films ua films concentrates on developing producing and acquiring specialized films with a net cost of less than 100 million both production units are supported by centralized marketing sales legal physical production and distribution functions 

  

mgm pictures plans to distribute approximately seven to ten motion pictures annually across a variety of genres and budget ranges mgm pictures employs a development staff of creative executives who refine concepts and scripts so that projects are developed to the point that production decisions can be made mgm pictures has entered into production alliances with a select group of producers many of them genrespecific these producers will develop and produce motion pictures exclusively or semiexclusively for mgm pictures and will use their relationships and creative abilities to provide another source of product for mgm pictures the seven to ten pictures distributed by mgm pictures are anticipated to be a combination of internally developed pictures pictures developed andor produced by the allied producers pictures which are coproduced or cofinanced with other major studios or independent partners and pictures acquired through negative pickups or other distribution arrangements mgm pictures’ strategy is to both increase creative diversity and mitigate 

  

financial risk in connection with motion picture production we expect to enhance creative diversity by employing the production alliance strategy discussed above and by entering into selective production agreements with successful established producers 

  

we also intend to seek to spread the financial risk inherent in motion picture production as well as increase the breadth of our release slate by entering into coproduction andor cofinancing arrangements as an example of this strategy in december 2003 we entered into an agreement with miramax films pursuant to which mgm and miramax would jointly produce finance and distribute a remake of the amityville horror  additionally we are currently developing yours mine and ours  a remake in a singlepot coproduction with paramount 

  

we have established ua films as a speciality artistfriendly division for quality independent films which will release approximately five to ten motion pictures each year these motion pictures will be produced or coproduced by ua films or acquired through negative pickups or other distribution arrangements and will include some motion pictures in a variety of genres generally involving producers directors writers or other talent who typically work outside of the studio system as well as lower budget films from established filmmakers our investment in such pictures is expected to be significantly less than our investment for pictures produced through mgm pictures we believe that this strategy of releasing specialty motion pictures will add greater diversity to our release slate and enhance the library both through the addition of new film product and the building of relationships with upandcoming producers and directors writers and other talent 

  

compared to other major studios we believe we have entered into and seek to pursue fewer traditional producer or talent “overhead” arrangements in which a studio pays a portion of the overhead of creative talent ie producer director or actor for the right to receive a “first look” at that party’s projects we generally believe that our capital resources are better allocated to acquire literary properties or the services of talent for a specific project in addition our current business plan also calls for our annual release slates to be comprised of proportionately fewer large budget “event” motion pictures than the current release slates of the other major studios 

  

we do not own any studio facilities or stages but lease facilities and sound stages on an “as needed” basis in connection with the production of specific motion picture and television projects we have not experienced any difficulties in leasing appropriate facilities and sound stages when needed 

  

motion picture production and distribution is highly speculative and inherently risky there can be no assurance of the economic success of any motion picture since the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a motion picture which do not necessarily bear a direct correlation to the production or distribution costs incurred depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public which cannot be predicted the commercial success of a motion picture also depends upon the acceptance of competing films released into the marketplace at or near the same time the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty further the theatrical success of a motion picture is generally a key factor in generating revenues from other distribution channels there is a substantial risk that some or all of our motion pictures will not be commercially successful resulting in costs not being recouped or anticipated profits not being realized see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

finally consummation of the merger with loc acquisition company would likely result in a change in our plans and business model described above 

  

the following table details our tentative 2005 domestic theatrical release 

  

release schedule 

  

   

   

the release date of a motion picture may be revised as the production schedule changes or in such a manner as the distributor believes is likely to maximize revenues additionally there can be no assurance that any of the motion pictures scheduled for release will be completed that completion will occur in accordance with the anticipated schedule or budget or that the motion pictures will necessarily involve all of the creative talent listed above see the discussion above in “—motion picture production” 

  

television production 

  

we have in the past engaged in the development and production of episodic television series miniseries and movies for distribution on domestic and international television networks local independent and network affiliated television stations pay television networks basic cable networks and home video since the re establishment of our television series production operations in 1994 we have obtained commitments for approximately 1525 hours of television programming of which approximately four percent remained to be aired as of december 31 2004 

  

our strategy has been to focus on the development and production of series for cable television and the firstrun syndication market which involves a lower production investment risk and movies and miniseries for both network and offnetwork broadcasters as part of our strategy in 1994 we entered into a programming arrangement with showtime whereby we provided television series and movies for premiere on showtime showtime agreed to license from us exclusive us pay television rights to the following television series a 132 hours six seasons of the outer limits winner of the cable ace award for best dramatic series in 1995 and 1996 all of which have aired b 66 episodes three seasons of poltergeist the legacy all of which have aired and c 110 episodes five seasons of stargate sg1 all of which have aired we have no further commitments from showtime with respect to these series following their initial exhibition cycle on showtime we have exploited these programs further in other markets in this respect we entered into a license agreement with usascifi channel for the exclusive domestic basic cable exhibition rights of the outer limits poltergeist the legacy and stargate sg1 we are producing 84 new episodes of stargate sg1 for usasci fi of which 54 episodes have aired as of december 31 2004 20 episodes will be aired in 2005 and ten episodes will be aired in 2006 in continuance of this strategy we have entered into a license agreement with usascifi channel with respect to the production of 40 episodes of stargate atlantis  a new onehour action adventure series based on our successful stargate franchise ten episodes of stargate atlantis have aired as of december 31 2004 20 episodes will air in 2005 and ten episodes will air in 2006 

  

the programming agreement with showtime also included a commitment by showtime to license eight madefortelevision movies from us none of which remain to be produced as of december 31 2004 one of the licensed movies dirty pictures  won the golden globe award for “best miniseries or motion picture made for television” in 2001 giving showtime its first ever victory in that category in addition showtime has committed to licensing three onehour series the first of which jeremiah  is a onehour action series thirtyfive episodes of jeremiah have been produced and all of such episodes have aired as of december 31 2004 the second series is dead like me  a onehour drama thirty episodes have been produced and all have aired as of december 31 2004 the additional series commitment remains to be produced 

  

in firstrun syndication we launched a new series for the 20022003 broadcast season called she spies in an arrangement with nbc for station clearances on nbc owned and operated stations she spies was renewed for the 20032004 broadcast season forty episodes of the series were produced as of december 31 2003 and all episodes have aired as of december 31 2004 in addition all 40 episodes have been cleared on nbc owned and operated stations for the 20042005 broadcast season 

  

as the risks involved in the firstrun syndication business have increased significantly in recent years with the advent of mass vertical integration the resulting consolidation in the marketplace and the recent downturn in the economy and advertising market we are evaluating production of series for network television and continuing to focus on cable television although network television production typically requires greater deficit financing while offering the potential for greater financial return we intend to pursue joint ventures coproductions and other partnering arrangements for some of our future series in order to minimize our financial risk recently realitybased programming has been an exception to the high deficithigh risk network model as networks will typically cover most if not all of the production costs of such programming although the potential financial return for reality programming is significantly lower than it is for highdeficit network programming we intend to explore this market due to the minimization of financial risk it offers in fact during the summer of 2003 we produced 12 episodes of fame  a onehour realitybased series inspired by our feature film for nbc 

  

our rich film library provides us with a vast resource for developing television production and potential licensing opportunities much of our past success has resulted from transforming such library product into successful television franchises such as in the heat of the night stargate sg1 stargate atlantis and the outer limits  currently we are developing the following projects among others legally blonde  a onehour series adaptation of our recent hit feature films barbershop  a halfhour series adaptation of our recent hit feature film and the thomas crown affairs  a onehour adaptation of our popular feature film 

  

since our ability to recover production costs and realize profits on our television programs depends on various factors including but not limited to the programs’ acceptance by the public fluctuations in prevailing advertising rates and the ability to distribute the programs subsequent to their firstrun license there can be no assurance that we can recover the production costs or realize profits on any television series thus there is a substantial risk that some or all of our television projects will not be commercially successful resulting in costs not being recouped or anticipated profits not being realized see “—distribution” and “—competition” there is also financial exposure to us after the programming is licensed to the extent that advertising revenues andor license fees we receive are not sufficient to cover production costs moreover we may have certain financial obligations to the producer of a series if we cancel production prior to commencement of production for any broadcast season for which the series was licensed 

  

distribution 

  

theatrical distribution 

  

general the initial step in the release of a motion picture is the booking of engagements with theatrical exhibitors the exhibitors retain a portion of admissions paid at the box office which generally includes a fixed amount per week as well as a percentage of the gross receipts that escalates over time a studio’s or other 

  

producer’s or third party distributor’s share is generally approximately 50 percent of gross box office receipts although that percentage has generally decreased in recent years and varies depending upon factors such as market competition and the overall performance of the film 

  

our goal is to release a slate of films appealing to a wide variety of audiences by strategically timing the release of our motion pictures throughout the year we seek to avoid some of the risks posed when a motion picture is inappropriately released during the most crowded and competitive box office seasons we believe that this strategy is unlikely to have a negative impact on our ability to generate home video rentals 

  

all motion pictures that we release theatrically in the us and canada whether produced by mgm pictures ua films or third parties are marketed and distributed by mgm distribution co 

  

in june 1999 we entered into an agreement with fox pursuant to which fox provides distribution services for our films in the international theatrical market this distribution services arrangement took effect on november 1 2000 although fox is servicing international theatrical distribution activities on our behalf we have reserved broad powers to direct and control the handling and release of our films we believe that this arrangement with fox reduces the amount of fixed overhead related to the distribution of our theatrical product in the international marketplace 

  

coproduction and distribution agreements in addition to producing motion pictures independently we enter into coproduction agreements split rights deals and similar arrangements under which we retain certain distribution rights with respect to a picture and share the cost of production with a partner that obtains other rights while such agreements limit our risk relating to a motion picture’s performance as they reduce our production costs such agreements also limit profitability we also acquire rights to distribute films through negative pickup arrangements under which we acquire a completed motion picture or certain rights therein from a third party under coproduction agreements split rights deals or negative pickup arrangements we may be committed to spend specified amounts for prints and advertising additionally we occasionally enter into “rentasystem” arrangements under which we provide distribution services to an independent film company for a percentage distribution fee under rentasystem arrangements the independent film company generally is responsible for all print and advertising costs these types of arrangements may be entered into before during or after production of a particular motion picture 

  

digital distribution on march 27 2002 a whollyowned subsidiary mgm digital development inc acquired a oneseventh interest in ndc llc a partnership created with the six other major studios to a develop andor ratify standards for digital motion picture equipment and for digital cinema technology to be used in the delivery of high quality intheatre digital cinema and b update and deploy a limited amount of new digital motion picture equipment in theatres we have contributed approximately 12 million for our equity interest in the joint venture the initial term of the agreement has been extended and now expires on september 30 2005 

  

theatrical marketing our theatrical marketing department consists of five functional groups research media planning advertising promotion and publicity the objective of the marketing department is to maximize each motion picture’s commercial potential by designing and implementing a marketing campaign tailored to appeal to the picture’s most receptive audience the marketing process begins with research before a motion picture is completed the research department determines through audience screenings and focus groups a motion picture’s appeal to its most likely target audience the marketing group begins to develop marketing materials well in advance of a motion picture’s scheduled theatrical release the marketing campaign generally begins six months before release with the circulation of teaser trailers posters and exhibitor advertising materials the campaign becomes more aggressive two to three months before release as fulllength trailers are released in theaters and additional materials are sent to exhibitors finally a national media campaign is launched four to five weeks before opening day this media campaign generally involves advertising a picture’s release on national television including network prime time and syndication markets national cable and radio and in 

  

magazines newspapers and specific target markets in addition public appearances such as television talk shows are arranged for a picture’s stars in order to promote the film the entire process is managed by our inhouse staff although outside agencies are frequently retained to provide certain creative services 

  

home video distribution 

  

our marketing and distribution strategy in the home video market domestically and internationally has been to a market our motion picture and television titles in cohesive consumer and retailer promotions b create branded product lines c adapt to a maturing vhs market and a growing dvd market and d release new motion pictures into the home entertainment market at the time of the year that we believe will achieve the best results 

  

in addition to organizing our vhs and dvd product into branded collections we have launched an integrated sales and marketing branding initiative designed to create awareness for mgm catalog product and to drive store traffic to dedicated displays in key customer outlets under the “mgm means great movies” umbrella message the general advertising retailerspecific advertising and all instore signage for the mgm dedicated sections are combined to create awareness and demand for mgm catalog titles and to help consumers find them in stores 

  

additionally in connection with new films which we release into the market we often release related library films or groups of library films in order to increase sales of both the library films and new releases an example is the release of the james bond library titles in connection with the november 2002 theatrical release of die another day  another example is the repromotion of barbershop in connection with the february 2004 theatrical release of barbershop 2  furthermore we have released 1000 mgm dvd titles and now have a critical mass of properties in the marketplace from which we are able to create effective promotions that target the growing dvd consumer base 

  

mgm home entertainment manages the marketing and distribution of our current feature motion pictures and library product in the home video and other home entertainment markets 

  

in june 1999 we entered into an agreement with fox home entertainment pursuant to which fox home entertainment provides distribution services for our films in the international home video market this distribution arrangement became effective on february 1 2000 on june 24 2003 we gave notice to fox home entertainment of our intent to terminate the agreement as of january 31 2004 as permitted under the agreement however we negotiated to continue the agreement in a modified form under which fox has continued to provide subdistribution services in certain territories and we continue to reserve broad powers to direct and control the handling of our home video product in 2003 we expanded our sales and marketing operations in western europe adding france and germany to operations already in place in the uk we also added to our north american sales marketing and distribution operations with the addition of canada to our existing us distribution furthermore in early 2004 we took control of all sales marketing and distribution operations in the uk france germany australia and benelux 

  

from 2001 to 2004 we increased our annual worldwide home video gross revenue from feature films from 5845 million to 9192 million we believe that this increase is in part a result of effective and efficient sales marketing and distribution of new release and library product and the growth of the dvd market 

  

in 2004 we continued to focus on developing strong retail relationships and programs that have increased our instore presence this presence has in turn increased our exposure to the endconsumer at retail and has had a positive impact on sales furthermore our retailers have recognized our successful sales and distribution effort in 2004 we were named sam’s club vendor of the third quarter kmart’s entertainment  leisure vendor of the year for australia and received the aafes best partner award in 2003 we were named vendor of the year from best buy an award we also won in 2001 we also received the altitunes vendor of the year award and the shopko vendor of the year award for the second consecutive year 

  

we have entered into revenue sharing agreements for our new releases and certain library titles pursuant to which we lease titles to rental establishments and receive a percentage of the consumer rental revenues generated from such titles although we can provide no assurance we believe that such arrangements may increase our revenues from the home video rental market by allowing us to participate in increased revenues from successful titles even though these revenues will be received over a longer period 

  

in 2004 we continued efforts to expand our video library domestically and internationally through the acquisition of distribution rights from third parties and the internal development of films that leverage our properties an example of this is the december 2004 dvd premiere and release of species iii  which is the sequel to the species and species ii theatrical features 

  

we intend to continue capitalizing on growing distribution formats such as dvd the dvd console installed base in the united states grew from over one million households at the beginning of 1999 to a base of approximately 68 million households by the end of 2004 we believe that this rapid growth combined with the strong desire among new dvd owners to create new film collections will continue to be a source of incremental revenue for us 

  

our dvd sales have increased from 3881 million in 2001 to 9108 million in 2004 an increase of approximately 135 percent the increase in dvd sales was partially offset by a drop in videocassette format sales resulting in an approximate 64 percent increase in worldwide home video sales we intend to continue expansion and exploitation of our dvd library product into 2005 

  

we also seek to capitalize on emerging distribution technologies such as videoondemand a technology that gives consumers the ability to order and control the playback of a feature film or other property as an example in 2001 we entered into a videoondemand joint venture now named movielink with four other major studios to distribute our properties in 2002 movielink launched a videoondemand service over the internet 

  

the development andor emergence of such distribution technologies platforms and formats however is dependent on the development and rollout of technology as well as other external factors and may create new risks to our ability to protect our intellectual property see “—competition” 

  

television distribution 

  

general we frequently license our current theatrical motion pictures for pay television through output agreements pursuant to which films not yet produced are prelicensed for a specified fee paid on delivery we believe that output agreements with international distributors with recognized expertise are beneficial 

  

we seek to enter into relatively shortterm licenses of our library motion pictures for pay and free television with title selections designed for the relevant marketplace we have created a proprietary database for use by our sales force which contains detailed information on each of our films including dates of availability media controlled by us sales history genre format length stars soundtrack etc the sales force can utilize this information in order to fulfill customer demand for strategically designed offerings of motion pictures based on various criteria we believe that this system has provided our sales force with an advantage in a competitive marketplace that requires large amounts of diverse content 

  

domestic pay television we have a theatrical motion picture output agreement with showtime requiring our future theatrical motion pictures to air on showtime’s pay television network we have extended the output term of the agreement with showtime to cover pictures theatrically released in the us commencing january 1 2000 and continuing until the earlier of december 31 2008 or the delivery of 270 pictures under the agreement we have delivered 61 titles to date the license fees for each picture are generally determined according to a formula based on us theatrical rentals of such picture 

  

in september 2001 we entered into a tenyear licensing agreement with starz encore group that includes over 1100 of our library films the deal generates significant revenue and cash flow from the library titles and because the movies will shift in and out of starz encore windows we will also be able to sell them to other buyers throughout the course of the license term 

  

domestic free television we distribute our feature motion pictures to us and canadian networks local television stations and basic cable networks in the us and canada we also generate revenue by granting syndication licenses on a barter basis barter syndication allows the television stations to license our product in exchange for a portion of the local commercial airtime we in turn sell commercial airtime to advertisers on a national basis while the television stations retain a portion of the commercial airtime for local advertisers we have used outside barter companies to sell television spots to advertisers in the past but we commenced our own barter sales business in 1996 

  

in february 2002 we transitioned our barter sales operations to mgmnbc media sales llc a new media sales company formed by mgm domestic television distribution llc and nbc enterprises inc to act as an agent to sell barter advertising spots received by each company as full or partial consideration from the licensing of feature film and television programming product in the domestic syndication market the joint venture recognized income from fees earned on each company’s barter sales and incurred overhead costs to operate the joint venture which were shared between the companies each company was entitled to its share of the net profits or losses of mgmnbc media sales llc based on a contractual formula as specified in the agreement as of june 30 2004 the parties agreed to terminate the venture as of the end of 2004 under the termination agreement we assumed the sale of advertising spots for our programming in the domestic television syndication market in july 2004 on september 30 2004 the joint venture was terminated and all distribution agreements were terminated by december 31 2004 

  

in connection with the acquisition of mgmua by pathe in november 1990 mgmpathe licensed the domestic free television rights to a substantial portion of its library the ua library and the post1986 mgmua titles in theatrical release at the time constituting approximately 850 titles and selected television programs to turner for a period of ten years beginning from the availability of each such product in that market the license excludes motion pictures released theatrically beginning in 1987 with respect to all but 85 motion pictures covered by the turner license the domestic free television rights revert to us by the end of 2005 we expect to receive relatively little revenue from the licensing of the product covered by the agreement with turner in the domestic free television market until such product reverts to us we completed negotiations with turner to accelerate the termination of the turner license all rights revert by the end of 2006 we believe that due to the significant increases in licensing fees for domestic television since 1990 the expiration of the turner license and our subsequent ability to freely license the library in this market together with our ability to utilize these titles on mgm branded cable and satellite channels will generate incremental revenue for us see “—film and television library” 

  

in june 2001 we entered into an agreement with the united paramount network upn to supply one film per week to the network which is broadcast in its saturday daytime slot we sell the network advertising within the films in a revenue sharing arrangement with upn in april 2002 upn exercised its first option to renew the agreement for an additional year in march 2003 upn exercised its second option to renew the agreement for a third year through september 5 2004 currently we have a new movie weekly agreement through fall 2005 with an option for an additional three years

international pay and free television we currently distribute our motion pictures and television product through pay television licenses in over 100 territories we have output agreements with licensees in major territories including germany france the united kingdom italy japan latin america and brazil financial instability and increased concentration of buyers in foreign television markets including in european pay television markets may adversely affect our ability to renew output agreements on favorable terms in 2004 we recognized 946 million in revenue from international pay television distribution accounting for five percent of our total revenue for the year in october 2002 we entered into a new output agreement with premiere the leading paytelevision provider in germany and austria the new agreement replaces our prior agreement with kirchgruppe which filed for bankruptcy protection in germany the new agreement contains lower license fees but also provides for the launch of an mgmbranded channel in germany see “—branded cable and satellite channels” 

  

we currently distribute our motion pictures and television product through free television licenses in over 100 territories in 2004 we recognized 1937 million in revenues under these agreements accounting for 11 percent of our total revenues for the year these license arrangements typically provide licensees with the right to exhibit the licensed motion pictures on television for a specific number of airings over a period of three to seven years 

  

in 1984 mgmua entered into a longterm license of free television rights for theatrical television movies and television series in our library with degeto film germany substantially all of the license fees have already been paid to us and therefore we do not expect to receive significant revenues in future periods the distribution rights to the motion pictures and television series licensed under the degeto agreement were scheduled to return to us incrementally through 2010 effective january 2000 we amended the degeto agreement to reclaim nonexclusive pay television rights in germany to the approximately 425 titles subject to the license in exchange we agreed to extend degeto’s now nonexclusive license periods on a majority of the licensed titles by approximately 18 months beyond the original end dates for those titles this agreement with degeto now provides us with an opportunity to generate incremental revenue in germany’s pay television market see “—film and television library” 

  

additionally orion entered into certain longterm licenses covering a significant number of its library motion pictures in the international free and pay television markets orion had already received substantially all of the license fees under these licenses prior to our acquisition of orion and therefore we do not expect significant revenue from these licenses in future periods orion licensed titles to capitol film and tv international germany compagnie luxembourgeoise de telediffusion france film finance group inc 

  

principal network limited italy mitsubishi corporation japan and televisio de catalunya sa spain the distribution rights granted to capitol film and tv international originally reverted to orion in 2025 in 2001 we negotiated the early return of 52 titles under license to capitol film  tv international for germanspeaking europe which gives us the opportunity to receive additional incremental license fees for the titles the majority of distribution rights granted to compagnie luxembourgeoise de telediffusion revert to orion between 2009 and 2013 the distribution rights granted to film finance group inc and principal network limited revert to orion through 2013 the distribution rights granted to televisio de catalunya sa currently are reverting to orion with such reversion being complete in 2010 we believe that due to the importance of france spain japan and italy and the significant increases in licensing fees for television in these markets since 1990 the expiration of these licenses and our subsequent ability to freely license our library in these markets could create substantial incremental revenue 

  

in march 2001 we entered into an innovative multiyear agreement with nbc enterprises  syndication which was extended in january 2003 under which we will provide distribution services for certain nbc studios programming across all territories outside of north america we handle the sales and distribution of all of nbc studios’ current and future series and movies for television including the primetime series crossing jordan  will  grace  las vegas american dreams and happy family  also included in the agreement are a library component madefortelevision movies miniseries soap operas and specials

branded cable and satellite channels we believe that pursuing our strategy of providing strategically pooled branded mgm programming through the licensing of television channels to cable and satellite operators as well as through the development of new channels of distribution that deliver our programming will provide opportunities in the international marketplace as foreign countries continue to develop cable and satellite television infrastructures we cannot assure you that we will have the financing that may be necessary for such acquisitions or investments that we will consummate such transactions or that we will be able to realize any anticipated benefits from any such transactions

trademarks and consumer products 

  

we own a portfolio of over 2200 trademark registrations around the world for such venerable trademarks as metrogoldwynmayer mgm the mgm lion logo united artists ua orion cannon and variations thereof we also own or control trademarks and characters associated with motion pictures and television series we produced andor distributed such as the pink panther and rocky in 2004 we realized over 271 million in revenue from the licensing of these trademarks and characters including interactive media products 

  

the mgm name and the mgm lion logo are among the most recognized trademarks in the world and have for over 75 years designated the source of the highest quality entertainmentrelated goods and services we believe these trademarks represent assets of which the value has been substantially unrealized in the past we plan to pursue a focused branded strategy that will capitalize on our name and logo and to seek licensing opportunities for such name and logo as well as our other trademarks in a wide range of product categories and distribution channels 

  

in february 1980 our predecessorininterest granted to a predecessorininterest of mgm mirage an exclusive openended royaltyfree license to use the trademark mgm as well as certain stylized lion depictions in its resort hotel andor gaming businesses and other businesses not related to filmed entertainment this license was amended in 1998 in june 2000 the license was further amended to allow mgm mirage to use the trademark mgm in combination with the trademark mirage to the same extent that it was permitted theretofore with regard to the mgm grand trademark in consideration of this further grant of rights mgm mirage agreed to pay an annual license fee of 10 million mgm mirage paid us 10 million in advance in june 2000 10 million in july 2001 10 million in july 2002 and 10 million in july 2003 beginning in the fall of 2003 the company entered into discussions with mgm mirage to clarify certain terms of the license and to separate ownership of the mgm mirage trademarks from the company’s trademarks in may 2004 we entered into a trademark coexistence and assignment agreement with mgm mirage whereby the mgm grand trademarks were assigned to mgm mirage in exchange for a broadening of the category of goods and services for which mgm has exclusivity with regard to the use of the trademark mgm and derivatives thereof this agreement replaces and supersedes the abovenamed license as amended but maintains in a separate license agreement all of the terms and conditions including the 10 million annual payment of the june 2000 amendment regarding the use by mgm mirage of the trademark mgm in combination with the trademark mirage mgm mirage paid us 10 million on june 30 2004 in accordance with the provisions of this new license agreement

competition 

  

motion picture production and distribution are highly competitive businesses we face competition from companies within the entertainment business as well as alternative forms of leisure entertainment we compete with the other major studios numerous independent motion picture and television production companies television networks and pay television systems for the acquisition of literary properties the services of performing artists directors producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing numerous organizations with which we compete in the motion picture industry have significantly greater financial and other resources than mgm while the independent production companies may have less overhead than mgm most of the other major studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations including television networks and cable channels which can provide both means of distributing their 

  

products and stable sources of earnings that offset the fluctuations in the financial performance of their motion picture and television operations see “—distribution—television distribution” 

  

in addition our motion pictures compete for audience acceptance and exhibition outlets with motion pictures produced and distributed by other companies as a result the success of any of our motion pictures is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular picture but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing motion pictures released into the marketplace at or near the same time the number of films released by our competitors particularly the other major film studios in any given period may create an oversupply of product in the market thereby potentially reducing our share of gross box office admissions and making it more difficult for our films to succeed 

  

competition is also intense within the television industry there are numerous suppliers of television programming including the networks the television production divisions of the major studios and independent producers all of which compete actively for the limited number of available broadcast hours our programming competes with firstrun programming network reruns and programs produced by local television stations competition is also intense in supplying motion pictures and other programming for the pay television and home video markets numerous organizations with which we compete in the television industry have significantly greater financial and other resources than mgm 

  

the entertainment industry in general and the motion picture and television industry in particular are continuing to undergo significant changes primarily due to technological developments for example as motion pictures begin to be distributed using emerging technologies such as the internet and online services the ability to protect intellectual property rights in motion pictures will be threatened by advances in technology that enable digital piracy this is because digital formats currently do not contain mechanisms for tracking the source or ownership of digital content as a result users may be able to download and distribute unauthorized or “pirated” copies of copyrighted motion pictures over the internet in addition there could be increased proliferation of devices capable of making unauthorized copies of motion pictures as long as pirated content is available to download digitally many consumers may choose to digitally download such pirated motion pictures rather than paying for legitimate motion pictures digital piracy of our films may adversely impact the gross receipts received from the exploitation of such films due to this rapid growth of technology and with it piracy as well as shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors will have on the potential revenue and profitability of featurelength motion pictures and television programming 

  

employees and labor matters 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 1440 fulltime and parttime regular employees in our worldwide operations of that total approximately 100 were primarily engaged in production and development approximately 680 were primarily engaged in sales marketing and distribution and approximately 660 were primarily engaged in management and administration there are 279 of our employees who are currently covered by employment contracts we also hire additional employees on a picturebypicture basis in connection with the production of our motion pictures and television programming the salaries of these additional employees as well as portions of the salaries of certain fulltime employees who provide direct production services are typically allocated to the capitalized cost of the related motion pictures or television programming we believe that our employee and labor relations are good 

  

there are 17 of our current employees and many of the employees or independent contractors that we hire on a projectbyproject basis who are represented under industrywide collective bargaining agreements with various unions including the writers guild of america the directors guild of america the screen actors guild and the international alliance of theatrical stage employees the motion picture and television programs produced by mgm studios and the other major studios in the united states generally employ actors writers and directors who are members of the screen actors guild writers guild of america and directors guild of 

  

america respectively pursuant to industrywide collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreement with the writers guild of america expires on october 31 2007 the collective bargaining agreement with the screen actors guild expires on june 30 2005 the parties are currently in negotiations for a successor agreement the collective bargaining agreement with the directors guild of america expires on june 30 2008 many productions also employ members of a number of other labor organizations including without limitation the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees and the international brotherhood of teamsters the collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 399 expires on july 31 2007 the collective bargaining agreement with the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees expires on july 31 2006 a strike by one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of motion pictures or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities such a halt or delay depending on the length of time involved could cause delay or interruption in our release of new motion pictures and television programs and thereby could adversely affect our cash flow and revenues our revenues from motion pictures and television programs in our library should not be affected and may partially offset the effects of a strike to the extent if any that television exhibitors buy more library product to compensate for interruption in their firstrun programming 

  

regulation 

  

in 1994 the us was unable to reach agreement with its major international trading partners to include audiovisual works such as television programs and motion pictures under the terms of the world trade organization the failure to include audiovisual works under gatt allows many countries including members of the european union which currently consists of austria belgium denmark germany greece finland france ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal spain sweden and the united kingdom to continue enforcing quotas that restrict the amount of us produced television programming which may be aired on television in such countries the european union council of ministers has adopted a directive requiring all member states of the european union to enact laws specifying that broadcasters must reserve where practicable a majority of their transmission time exclusive of news sports game shows and advertising for european works the directive must be implemented by appropriate legislation in each member country under the directive member states remain free to require broadcasters under their jurisdiction to comply with stricter rules for example france requires that original french programming constitute a required portion of all programming aired on french television these quotas apply only to television programming several countries including france italy and korea also have quotas on the theatrical exhibition of motion pictures we cannot assure you that additional or more restrictive theatrical or television quotas will not be enacted or that countries with existing quotas will not more strictly enforce such quotas additional or more restrictive quotas or more stringent enforcement of existing quotas could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to exploit fully our motion pictures internationally 

  

distribution rights to motion pictures are granted legal protection under the copyright laws of the us and most foreign countries which laws provide substantial civil and criminal sanctions for unauthorized duplication and exhibition of motion pictures we seek to take appropriate and reasonable measures to secure protect and maintain or obtain agreements to secure protect and maintain copyright protection for all of our motion pictures or television programming under the laws of applicable jurisdictions motion picture piracy is an international as well as a domestic problem motion picture piracy is extensive in many parts of the world including south america asia including korea china and taiwan the countries of the former soviet union and other former eastern bloc countries in addition to the mpaa the motion picture association the american film marketing association and the american film export association monitor the progress and efforts made by various countries to limit or prevent piracy in the past these various trade associations have enacted voluntary embargoes of motion picture exports to certain countries in order to pressure the governments of those countries to become more aggressive in preventing motion picture piracy in addition the us government has publicly considered trade sanctions against specific countries which do not take steps to prevent copyright infringement of us produced motion pictures there can be no assurance that voluntary industry embargoes or us government trade sanctions will be enacted if enacted such actions could impact the amount of revenue that we realize from 

  

the international exploitation of our motion pictures depending upon the countries subject to such action and the duration and effectiveness of such action if not enacted or if other measures are not taken the motion picture industry including mgm may continue to lose an indeterminate amount of revenues as a result of motion picture piracy 

  

the code and ratings administration of the mpaa assigns ratings indicating agegroup recommendations for theatrical distribution of motion pictures we have followed and will continue to follow the practice of submitting our pictures for such ratings as a substantial number of our films are rated “r” under rules which are the theatrical exhibitors’ responsibility to enforce children under 17 may attend the applicable motion picture only if accompanied by an adult 

  

united states television stations and networks as well as foreign governments impose content restrictions on motion pictures that may restrict in whole or in part exhibition on television or in a particular territory there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not limit or alter our ability to exhibit certain motion pictures in such media or markets 

  

by letter dated november 15 2001 we received a request from the department of justice for a voluntary production of information and documents relating to our movielink videoondemand joint venture with four other major studios we complied with that request on june 3 2004 the department of justice announced that it had closed its investigation of movielink

recent developments 

  

merger with loc acquisition company  on september 23 2004 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with loc acquisition company a delaware corporation owned by a consortium comprised of sony corporation of america providence equity partners texas pacific group comcast corporation and dlj merchant banking partners under the agreement the consortium will acquire mgm for 1200 in cash per share of our common stock plus the assumption of our debt completion of the merger is subject to various regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions jp morgan chase and credit suisse first boston have committed to provide the consortium with up to 425 billion of senior debt financing the consortium’s obligation to acquire mgm is conditioned upon consummation of the debt financing on the terms set forth in the commitment letters delivered by jp morgan chase and credit suisse first boston or substitute financing which if the debt financing commitments become unavailable the consortium is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain mgm’s stockholders approved the merger at a special meeting held on december 17 2004 in connection with the merger agreement tracinda and 250 rodeo voted all of their shares of mgm common stock in favor of the merger 

  

in connection with the merger agreement we and sony entered into a deposit agreement dated as of september 13 2004 as amended pursuant to which sony paid us a 150 million deposit in addition in connection with the merger agreement we entered into an indemnity agreement with tracinda 250 rodeo and mr kerkorian pursuant to which we will indemnify tracinda 250 rodeo and mr kerkorian against certain liabilities relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 

  

under the deposit agreement we must return the deposit to sony at the effective time of the merger otherwise the deposit is nonrefundable unless 1 the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances where we are required to pay a termination fee to loc acquisition company provided that if the merger agreement is terminated by loc acquisition company because a our board withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to loc acquisition company its recommendation that our stockholders adopt the merger agreement or recommends approves or adopts an alternative takeover proposal or b we fail to include in the proxy statement relating to the merger or any amendment the recommendation of our board that our stockholders vote in favor of the merger or c a third party commences a tender or exchange offer for mgm and our board does not recommend rejection of the offer within ten business days or d our board approves or recommends an alternative takeover proposal or approves or recommends that its stockholders tender their shares in any tender or exchange offer the deposit is only refundable if we enter into a binding agreement with a third 

  

party with respect to an alternative takeover proposal within nine months of termination of the merger agreement or 2 a court has determined that there has been material adverse effect with respect to mgm 

  

although we have no reason to believe that the merger will not be consummated the pendency of a merger involving a motion picture studio tends to create uncertainty in the entertainment business community as a result it has been more difficult for us to attract development projects attach talent to projects commence productions and implement distribution initiatives in the home video and television sales markets during the progress of merger discussions and the executory period of the merger agreement accordingly in the event that the merger should fail to be consummated there may be a gap or reduction in the number of motion picture releases for a period of time following termination of the merger agreement until we can reinvigorate our development production and distribution activities in addition we could face a loss of personnel or a decline in morale if the merger should fail to be consummated such occurrences could be expected to have at least temporarily a significant adverse effect upon our business in the event that as a result of termination of the merger agreement we retain sony’s 150 million deposit these adverse effects would be mitigated but there is no guarantee that the deposit alone would be sufficient to mitigate the entire negative effect of nonconsummation of the merger 

  

in addition if loc acquisition company terminates the merger agreement because we have breached any of our covenants such that the conditions to closing cannot be satisfied and there is a final binding judgment of a court that we willfully and materially breached the merger agreement as to which all rights of appeal or other avenues of review have been exhausted or lapsed then the amount of the deposit may be taken into account in determining any damages resulting from our willful and material breach 

  

the merger agreement is presently expected to close shortly after the end of the first quarter of 2005 however there can be no assurance that all of the conditions to the merger including the conditions within our control will be satisfied or that the merger will be completed 

  

stockholder dividend on april 26 2004 we declared a special onetime cash dividend of 800 per share to stockholders of record on may 7 2004 which was paid on may 17 2004 the cash dividend aggregating approximately 189 billion was financed by borrowings under our new 24 billion credit facility see “—liquidity and capital resources—bank borrowings” 

  

pursuant to the provisions of the amended and restated 1996 stock incentive plan the compensation committee of the board of directors has adjusted the outstanding stock options issued on or before may 17 2004 under the plan such that following the payment of the onetime cash dividend to stockholders each option holder shall receive upon exercise in addition to the shares of common stock otherwise obtainable a cash amount of 800 per share 

  

new credit facility on april 26 2004 we entered into a fourth amended and restated credit facility with a syndicate of banks aggregating 24 billion consisting of a fiveyear 4000 million revolving credit facility a sixyear 4000 million term loan and a sevenyear 16 billion term loan which replaced a preexisting 175 billion amended credit facility proceeds from the loans under the new credit facility were used to finance the payment of the 189 billion stockholder dividend see above and to refinance loans under the preexisting credit facility the new revolving credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes 

  

the credit agreement provides that certain change of control transactions including a transaction such as the pending merger with loc acquisition company constitute an event of default resulting in acceleration of the loans and termination of the revolving credit facility in connection with the closing of the merger the credit facility will be replaced and superseded by debt financing arranged by the consortium 

  

in connection with the refinancing of the prior credit facility we wrote off deferred loan fees of 69 million in the year ended december 31 2004 

  

dutch auction tender offer on december 4 2003 we commenced a dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to 10000000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price not greater than 1800 nor less than 1625 per share under the procedures for the dutch auction tender offer our stockholders had the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares of common stock at prices specified by the stockholders we then determined the lowest price per share within the range of 1625 to 1800 per share that would enable us to buy 10000000 shares or such lesser number of shares that are properly tendered and not withdrawn all shares accepted in the dutch auction tender offer were purchased by us at the same determined price per share regardless of whether the stockholders tendered at a lower price tracinda 250 rodeo and mr kerkorian our principal stockholders did not participate in the dutch auction tender offer nor did any members of our board of directors or executive management 

  

the dutch auction tender offer expired on january 15 2004 pursuant to the dutch auction tender offer we purchased 10000000 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of 1700 per share or an aggregate amount of 1700 million plus offering expenses of approximately 10 million the dutch auction tender offer was financed primarily from available cash on hand net cash flow provided by operating activities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility see “—liquidity and capital resources” currently mr kerkorian tracinda and 250 rodeo together own approximately 73 percent of our outstanding common stock 

  

notice of termination of third party international subdistribution agreement in june 1999 we entered into an agreement with fox home entertainment pursuant to which fox home entertainment provides distribution services for our films in the international home video market this distribution arrangement became effective on february 1 2000 on june 24 2003 we gave notice to fox home entertainment of our intent to terminate the agreement as of january 31 2004 as permitted under the agreement effective february 1 2004 we entered into an amended agreement with fox home entertainment under which fox home entertainment will continue to perform subdistribution services in certain territories all termination payments required under the amended agreement were paid during the quarter ended march 31 2004 under the terms of the amended agreement we pay fox home entertainment a distribution fee based on gross receipts as defined 

  

termination of mgmnbc media sales joint venture on september 30 2004 mgm domestic television distribution llc and nbc enterprises inc terminated their joint venture mgmnbc media sales llc and all distribution agreements were terminated by december 31 2004 the joint venture was formed in february 2002 to act as an agent to sell barter advertising spots received by us and nbc as full or partial consideration from the licensing of feature film and television programming product in the domestic television syndication market upon termination of the joint venture we assumed the sale of advertising spots for our programming in the domestic television syndication market 

  

sources of revenue 

  

the principal sources of motion picture industry revenue are the domestic and international distribution of motion pictures including theatrical exhibition home entertainment and television payperview pay network syndication and basic cable over the last decade the relative contributions of these components of revenues have changed dramatically although revenues from domestic theatrical distribution have increased growth in total motion picture industry revenues has resulted predominantly from increased revenues derived from the distribution of motion pictures internationally as well as from other media and distribution channels 

  

our feature films are exploited through a series of sequential domestic and international distribution channels typically beginning with theatrical exhibition thereafter feature films are first made available for 

  

home video generally six months after theatrical release for pay television one year after theatrical release and for syndication approximately three to five years after theatrical release our television programming is produced for initial broadcast on either pay syndicated or network television in the united states followed by international territories and in some cases worldwide video markets 

  

we distribute our motion picture and television productions in foreign countries and in recent years have derived approximately 35 to 40 percent of our revenues from foreign sources approximately 25 percent of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies in addition we incur certain operating and production costs in foreign currencies as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows we in certain instances enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of our firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows these contracts generally mature within one year we do not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative purposes realized gains and losses on contracts that hedge anticipated future cash flows were not material in any of the periods presented herein we had foreign currency exchange contracts of a notional amount of 20346 euros or the equivalent 27538 outstanding at december 31 2004 see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

  

cost structure 

  

general in the motion picture industry the largest component of the cost of producing a motion picture generally is the negative cost which includes the “abovetheline” and “belowtheline” costs of producing the film abovetheline costs are costs related to the acquisition of picture rights and the costs associated with the producer the director the writer and the principal cast belowtheline costs are the remaining costs involved in producing the picture such as film studio rental principal photography sound and editing 

  

the major studios generally fund production costs from cash flow generated by motion picture and related distribution activities or bank and other financing methods over the past decade expenses in the motion picture industry have increased rapidly as a result of increased production costs and distribution expenses additionally each of the major studios must fund substantial overhead costs consisting primarily of salaries and related costs of the production distribution and administrative staffs as well as facilities costs and other recurring overhead 

  

distribution expenses  distribution expenses consist primarily of the costs of advertising and preparing release prints the costs of advertising associated with a major domestic theatrical motion picture release are significant and typically involve national and target market media campaigns as well as public appearances of a film’s stars these advertising costs are separate from the advertising costs associated with other domestic distribution channels and the international market 

  

advertising and other promotional costs are included in selling general and administrative expenses the company includes the cost of duplicating prints which is a physical product in operating costs however the company considers the costs of shipping the prints to customers to be a selling cost as it is part of the company’s distribution activities and categorizes such activities as selling costs together with advertising marketing and other promotional costs shipping and handling costs of 892 million 728 million and 477 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively have been included in selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations respectively 

  

production overhead the company capitalizes production overhead including allocable costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of films in accordance with sop 002 “accounting by producers or distributors of films” as a component of film costs such allocable costs of departments are those with exclusive responsibility for the production of films including physical production and post production allocable costs of such departments principally include compensation costs of employees as well as certain other direct costs such as travel costs and outside services we compute the 

  

overhead to be allocated to film and television costs based on the criteria noted above and allocate such costs to film and television properties in proportion to the direct production expenditures of each property on an annual basis 

  

collective bargaining agreements the motion picture and television programs produced by mgm studios and the other major studios in the united states generally employ actors writers and directors who are members of the screen actors guild writers guild of america and directors guild of america respectively pursuant to industrywide collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreement with the writers guild of america expires on october 31 2007 the collective bargaining agreement with the screen actors guild expires on june 30 2005 the parties are currently in negotiations for a successor agreement the collective bargaining agreement with the directors guild of america expires on june 30 2008 many productions also employ members of a number of other labor organizations including without limitation the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees and the international brotherhood of teamsters the collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 399 expires on july 31 2007 the collective bargaining agreement with the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees expires on july 31 2006 a strike by one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of motion pictures or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities such a halt or delay depending on the length of time involved could cause delay or interruption in our release of new motion pictures and television programs and thereby could adversely affect our cash flow and revenues our revenues from motion pictures and television programs in our library should not be affected and may partially offset the effects of a strike to the extent if any that television exhibitors buy more library product to compensate for interruption in their firstrun programming 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

accounting for motion picture and television costs  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and industry practice we amortize the costs of production including capitalized interest and overhead as well as participations and talent residuals for feature films and television programming using the individualfilmforecast method under which such costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that revenue earned in the current period for such title bears to management’s estimate of the total revenues to be realized from all media and markets for such title all exploitation costs including advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred theatrical print costs are amortized over the periods of theatrical release of the respective territories 

  

management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its total revenue estimates defined as “ultimates” on a titlebytitle basis which may result in a change in the rate of amortization andor a writedown of the film or television asset to estimated fair value the company determines the estimated fair value for individual film and television properties based on the estimated future cash flows resulting from the ten year ultimate revenues and costs in accordance with sop 002 these ten year ultimates are also used to amortize the capitalized film costs in accordance with sop 002 the estimated future cash flows are discounted using a net present value model 

  

any revisions to ultimates can result in significant quartertoquarter and yeartoyear fluctuations in film writedowns and amortization a typical film or television program recognizes a substantial portion of its ultimate revenues within the first two years of release by then a film has been exploited in the domestic and international theatrical markets and the domestic and international home video markets as well as the domestic and international pay television and payperview markets and a television program has been exploited on network television or in firstrun syndication a similar portion of the film’s or television program’s capitalized costs should be expected to be amortized accordingly assuming the film or television program is profitable 

  

the commercial potential of individual motion pictures and television programming varies dramatically and is not directly correlated with production or acquisition costs therefore it is difficult to predict or project a trend of our income or loss however the likelihood that we report losses particularly in the year of a motion 

  

picture’s release is increased by the industry’s method of accounting which requires the immediate recognition of the entire loss through increased amortization in instances where it is estimated the ultimate revenues of a motion picture or television program will not recover our capitalized costs on the other hand the profit of a profitable motion picture or television program must be deferred and recognized over the entire revenue stream generated by that motion picture or television program this method of accounting may also result in significant fluctuations in reported income or loss particularly on a quarterly basis depending on our release schedule the timing of advertising campaigns and the relative performance of individual motion pictures or television programs 

  

other estimates  we estimate reserves for future returns of product in the home video markets as well as provisions for uncollectible receivables in determining the estimate of home video product sales that will be returned we perform an analysis that considers historical returns changes in customer demand and current economic trends based on this information a percentage of each sale is reserved provided that the customer has the right of return we estimate provisions for uncollectible receivables by monitoring delinquent accounts and estimating a reserve based on contractual terms and other customer specific issues specifically reviewed receivables include all receivables with past due balances greater than ninety days additionally we record a general reserve against all customers not reviewed on a specific basis we compute the percentage to be used to calculate the general reserve by reviewing historical writeoffs of receivables not previously specifically reserved 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” which establishes criteria to identify variable interest entities and the primary beneficiary of such entities an entity that qualifies as a variable interest entity must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary all other holders of interests in a variable interest entity must disclose the nature purpose size and activity of the variable interest entity as well as their maximum exposure to losses as a result of involvement with the variable interest entity interpretation no 46 was revised in december 2003 and is effective for financial statements of public entities that have specialpurpose entities as defined for periods ending after december 15 2003 for public entities without specialpurpose entities it is effective for financial statements for periods ending after march 15 2004 we do not have any specialpurpose entities as defined we adopted interpretation no 46 on january 1 2004 the adoption of interpretation no 46 did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 132 revised 2003 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” this statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” statement of financial accounting standards no 88 “employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits” and statement of financial accounting standards no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” this statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in statement of accounting standards no 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” which it replaces it requires additional disclosures to those in the original statement of financial accounting standards no 132 about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans the required information should be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans this statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 we implemented the statement of financial accounting standards no 132 revised 2003 on december 31 2003 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123r revised 2004 “sharebased payment” which is a revision of statement of financial 

  

accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” statement 123r supersedes accounting opinions board no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in statement 123r is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative statement 123r must be adopted no later than july 1 2005 and we plan to adopt statement 123r on january 1 2005 

  

we adopted the fairvaluebased method of accounting for sharebased payments effective january 1 2004 using the “modified prospective method” described in financial accounting standards board statement no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” currently we use the binomial model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expect to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model upon the required adoption of statement 123r we do not anticipate that adoption of statement 123r will have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position statement 123r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options the amounts are not expected to material because we have not historically recorded any tax benefits 

  

under the modified prospective method of adoption selected by us under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” stockbased employee compensation expense recognized in 2004 is the same as that which would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 been applied to all awards from its original effective date during the year ended december 31 2004 we recorded compensation expense of 308 million related to our employee stock incentive plan which charge has been included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations

ebitda 

  

while management considers ebitda to be an important measure of comparative operating performance it should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute for or superior to operating income net earnings cash flow and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ebitda does not reflect cash available to fund cash requirements and the items excluded from ebitda such as depreciation and nonfilm amortization are significant components in assessing our financial performance other significant uses of cash flows are required before cash will be available to us including debt service taxes and cash expenditures for various longterm assets we use ebitda to evaluate the operating performance of our business segments and as a measure of performance for compensation purposes we believe that ebitda is also used by some investors equity analysts and others as a measure of performance to make informed investment decisions our calculation of ebitda may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 

  

the following table reconciles consolidated ebitda to net loss for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002

we are committed to fund our share of the operating expenses of certain joint ventures as required these joint ventures include movielink llc a joint venture established to create an ondemand movie service via digital delivery for broadband internet users in the united states in which we own a 20 percent ownership interest with four other major studios as well a oneseventh ownership interest we hold in ndc llc a partnership created with six other major studios to develop and deploy digital cinema technology and equipment 

  

in theatres we are obligated to fund 300 million to movielink for our share of the venture’s operating expenses over a five year term ending in august 2006 as of december 31 2004 we have funded 202 million of this commitment as of december 31 2004 we have funded 12 million regarding our interest in ndc llc as of december 31 2004 we have no significant future cash funding requirements to any of our cable channel or other joint ventures 

  

anticipated needs our current strategy and business plan call for substantial ongoing investments in the production of new feature films and television programs furthermore we may wish to continue to make investments in new distribution channels to further exploit our motion picture and television library currently we would require additional sources of financing if we decided to make any additional significant investments in new distribution channels we plan to continue to evaluate the level of such investments in the context of the capital available to us and changing market conditions upon and after consummation of the merger agreement with loc acquisition company our business strategy is likely to change significantly 

  

we believe that the amounts available from cash on hand the unused portion of our revolving facility and from operating cash flow will be adequate for us to conduct our operations in accordance with our business plan for at least the next 12 months this belief is based in part on the assumption that our future releases will perform as planned any significant decline in the performance of our films could adversely impact our cash flows and require us to obtain additional sources of funds 

  

if necessary in order to manage our cash needs we may also delay or alter production or release schedules or seek to reduce our aggregate investment in new film and television production costs there can be no assurance that any such steps would be adequate or timely or that acceptable arrangements could be reached with third parties if necessary in addition although these steps would improve our shortterm cash flow and in the case of partnering reduce our exposure should a motion picture perform below expectations such steps could adversely affect longterm cash flow and results of operations in subsequent periods 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are subject to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because approximately 25 percent of our revenues are denominated and we incur certain operating and production costs in foreign currencies in certain instances we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of our firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows we currently intend to continue to enter into such contracts to hedge against future material foreign currency exchange rate risks the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2004 in thousands except spot and forward rates

the mgm retirement plan is a defined benefit plan under which all contributions are made by the company employees of the company who had completed at least one year of service prior to december 31 2000 are participants in the plan and become vested upon completion of five years of service participants or 

  

their beneficiaries are entitled to receive benefits which have vested under the plan i upon their normal early or deferred retirement or ii upon total and permanent disability death or other termination of such participant’s employment and after attaining normal or early retirement age the compensation covered by the mgm retirement plan includes base salary only and not bonus or other amounts 

  

the company has the right to amend or terminate the mgm retirement plan at any time if the plan is terminated the available assets held in trust will be used to pay benefits to participants if termination occurs when the plan’s assets are not sufficient to pay all benefits accrued to the date of the termination the assets held in trust under the plan will be allocated among participants in accordance with the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended the company is not liable for the payment of mgm retirement plan benefits from its own assets upon full satisfaction of the mgm retirement plan’s liability to employees and their beneficiaries any amount remaining in the plan will be returned to the company 

  

the internal revenue code requires certain provisions for benefit accruals if a defined benefit plan becomes “top heavy” that is if the value of accrued benefits for “key employees” is more than 60 percent of the total value of all accrued benefits while the company believes that it is unlikely that the mgm retirement plan will ever become top heavy in such an event it may become necessary to amend the mgm retirement plan to conform it to the applicable internal revenue code requirements 

  

effective as of december 31 2000 the mgm retirement plan was amended to i freeze the benefit accrual service of all participants ii prohibit the further accrual of benefits thereunder and iii prohibit any additional employees from commencing participation therein on or after january 1 2001 see “—pension plans”

 item 13 certain relationships and related transactions 

  

merger with loc acquisition company 

  

on september 23 2004 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with loc acquisition company a delaware corporation owned by a consortium comprised of sony corporation of america providence equity partners texas pacific group comcast corporation and dlj merchant banking partners under the agreement the consortium will acquire mgm for 1200 in cash per share of our common stock plus the assumption of our debt completion of the merger is subject to various regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions jp morgan chase and credit suisse first boston have committed to provide the consortium with up to 425 billion of senior debt financing the consortium’s obligation to acquire mgm is conditioned upon consummation of the debt financing on the terms set forth in the commitment letters delivered by jp morgan chase and credit suisse first boston or substitute financing which if the debt financing commitments become unavailable the consortium is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain mgm’s stockholders approved the merger at a special meeting held on december 17 2004 

  

in connection with the merger agreement we and sony corporation of america entered into a deposit agreement dated as of september 13 2004 as amended pursuant to which sony paid us a 150 million deposit in addition in connection with the merger agreement we entered into an indemnity agreement with tracinda 250 rodeo and mr kerkorian pursuant to which we will indemnify tracinda 250 rodeo and mr kerkorian against certain liabilities relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 

  

under the deposit agreement we must return the deposit to sony at the effective time of the merger otherwise the deposit is nonrefundable unless 1 the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances where we are required to pay a termination fee to loc acquisition company provided that if the merger agreement is terminated by loc acquisition company because a our board withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to loc acquisition company its recommendation that our stockholders adopt the merger agreement or recommends approves or adopts an alternative takeover proposal or b we fail to include in the proxy statement relating to the merger or any amendment the recommendation of our board that our stockholders vote in favor of the merger or c a third party commences a tender or exchange offer for mgm and our board does not recommend rejection of the offer within ten business days or d our board approves or recommends an alternative takeover proposal or approves or recommends that its stockholders tender their shares in any tender or exchange offer the deposit is only refundable if we enter into a binding agreement with a third party with respect to an alternative takeover proposal within nine months of termination of the merger agreement or 2 a court has determined that there has been material adverse effect with respect to mgm 

  

in addition if loc acquisition company terminates the merger agreement because we have breached any of our covenants such that the conditions to closing cannot be satisfied and there is a final binding judgment of a court that we willfully and materially breached the merger agreement as to which all rights of appeal or other avenues of review have been exhausted or lapsed then the amount of the deposit may be taken into account in determining any damages resulting from our willful and material breach 

  

the merger agreement presently is expected to close shortly after the end of the first quarter of 2005 however there can be no assurance that all of the conditions to the merger including the conditions within our control will be satisfied or that the merger will be completed 

  

although we have no reason to believe that the merger will not be consummated the pendency of a merger involving a motion picture studio tends to create uncertainty in the entertainment business community as a result it has been more difficult for us to attract development projects attach talent to projects commence productions and implement distribution initiatives in the home video and television sales markets during the progress of merger discussions and the executory period of the merger agreement accordingly in the event that the merger should fail to be consummated there may be a gap or reduction in the number of motion picture releases for a period of time following termination of the merger agreement until we can reinvigorate its development production and distribution activities in addition we could face a loss of personnel or a decline in morale if the merger should fail to be consummated such occurrences could be expected to have at least temporarily a significant adverse effect upon our business in the event that as a result of termination of the merger agreement we retain sony’s 150 million deposit these adverse effects would be mitigated but there is no guarantee that the deposit alone would be sufficient to mitigate the entire negative effect of nonconsummation of the merger 

  

interests of certain persons in the merger 

  

some of our executive officers and directors have interests in the merger in addition to their interests as stockholders of mgm which interests relate to or arise from among other things the continued indemnification of current directors and officers of mgm under the merger agreement and providing these individuals with directors’ and officers’ insurance the potential receipt of severance and retention payments and the conversion acceleration and cancellation of stock options 

  

indemnification directors’ and officers’ insurance 

  

as permitted by applicable provisions of the delaware general corporation law the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation as amended to date contains a provision whereunder the company will indemnify each of the officers and directors of the company or their estates if applicable and may indemnify any employee or agent of the company or their estates if applicable to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law as it exists or may in the future be amended 

  

in addition the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors executive officers and certain other officers providing for indemnification by the company including under circumstances in which indemnification is otherwise discretionary under delaware law these agreements constitute binding agreements between the company and each of the other parties thereto thus preventing the company from modifying its indemnification policy in a way that is adverse to any person who is a party to such an agreement 

  

under the merger agreement loc acquisition company has agreed that the surviving corporation will indemnify all present and former directors and officers of mgm and its subsidiaries acting in such capacities to the fullest extent permitted by law against any expenses or losses incurred in connection with any claim action suit proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to matters pending existing or occurring at or prior to the merger loc acquisition company has also agreed that the surviving corporation will cause to be maintained for six years after the effective date charter and bylaw provisions with respect to elimination of liability of directors and indemnification of officers directors employees and agents that are no less favorable to the intended beneficiaries than those contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the relevant subsidiary as in effect on the date the merger agreement was signed loc acquisition company has also agreed that the surviving corporation will honor all indemnification agreements entered into by mgm or any of its subsidiaries 

  

in addition loc acquisition company has agreed that the surviving corporation will provide or in the alternative mgm has the right to acquire for six years after the merger directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the merger covering each person currently covered by our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy on terms and in amounts no less favorable than those of our policy in effect on the date the merger agreement was signed provided that the surviving corporation will not be required to pay annual premiums for such insurance in excess of 300 percent of our annual premium in effect on the date the merger agreement was signed and if mgm acquires the insurance prior to the closing of the merger it may not pay a one time premium in excess of 300 percent of our annual premium in effect on the date the merger agreement was signed 

  

employee security plan for named executive officers 

  

pursuant to our employee security plan for named executive officers dated as of may 14 2004 which we refer to as the “security plan” if the employment of any of alex yemenidjian christopher j mcgurk william a jones jay rakow daniel j tayor is terminated by mgm without cause or by such executive for “good reason” in either event within one year following a change in control he will be entitled to receive at his election and in lieu of any severance benefits or other rights available to him pursuant to his employment contract or otherwise a lumpsum cash payment equal to either i the base salary and other contractual monetary payments collectively referred to as the “base salary” that he would have received over the remainder of the term of his employment agreement or ii thirty months of his thencurrent base salary in addition pursuant to the security plan mgm is required if necessary to make additional “grossup payments” to a participant in the security plan to offset fully the effect of any excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the internal revenue code on any excess parachute payment whether made to the participant pursuant to the security plan his employment agreement or otherwise in general section 4999 imposes an excise tax on the recipient of any excess parachute payment equal to 20 percent of such payment under section 280g of the internal revenue code a “parachute payment” is any payment that is contingent upon a change in control excess parachute payments consist of the excess of parachute payments over an individual’s average taxable compensation received by him from the employer during the five taxable years or if less the entire period of employment preceding the year in which the change in control occurs 

  

the merger will constitute a change in control under the security plan and section 280g of the internal revenue code assuming current compensation information remains in effect that the merger is consummated on june 30 2005 that a termination by mgm without cause or by the executive for good reason occurs immediately thereafter and that the executive elects to receive a lumpsum payment under the security plan the 

  

approximate value of the cash payments due under the security plan to each of the executive officers not including any payments that may be made with respect to any excise tax would be mr yemenidjian 6250000 mr mcgurk 5750000 mr jones 1789000 mr rakow 1931250 and mr taylor 2505250 

  

employee incentive plan 

  

during its meeting on may 12 2004 our board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of mgm and our stockholders that mgm be able to make payments under our employee incentive plan in respect of the 2004 and the 2005 performance periods whether or not the target performance levels for those performance periods are met this determination by our board which was communicated to our employees and approved by our compensation committee in the summer of 2004 reflects our board’s recognition that a potential change in control of mgm could cause a temporary disruption in our business which in turn could prevent the target performance levels under the employee incentive plan from being met 

  

the merger agreement does not permit us to waive the performance targets under the employee incentive plan however tracinda has agreed to make a capital contribution to mgm concurrently with the closing of the merger in an amount which we refer to as the bonus differential equal to a the aggregate bonuses actually paid under the employee incentive plan for 2004 and 2005 minus b the aggregate bonuses that participants in the employee incentive plan for 2004 and 2005 would have been paid if the target performance levels for such performance periods were not waived less c 50 million representing the amount that would otherwise have been allocated to the payment of retention bonuses to our employees loc acquisition company has agreed that as a result of this arrangement mgm may make payments under our employee incentive plan in respect of the 2004 and the 2005 performance periods whether or not the target performance levels for those performance periods are met 

  

based on our 2004 operating results the total of the bonus differential payments pursuant to this arrangement is approximately 51 million after taking into account the 50 million that would otherwise have been allocated to the payment of retention bonuses and our executive officers received approximate bonus differential payments for 2004 of mr yemenidjian 563000 mr mcgurk 518000 mr jones 158000 mr taylor 214000 and mr rakow 169000 the total bonus payments that may be paid for 2005 under the employee incentive plan will not exceed 248 million for the full year if the merger is completed prior to the end of 2005 then the total bonus payments will be prorated the maximum bonuses payable to our executive officers for 2005 under the employee incentive plan at target levels of performance are approximately mr yemenidjian 1125000 mr mcgurk 1035000 mr jones 315000 mr taylor 427500 and mr rakow 337500 if the merger is completed prior to the end of 2005 these amounts will be prorated as of the date of this report we cannot determine the portion of these bonus payments that would not have been paid if the target performance levels for 2005 were not met 

  

option payments 

  

in connection with the merger we will cash out and cancel all options to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to the excess or spread if any of 2000 per share over the per share exercise price of each option the 2000 amount was determined by adding 800 to the merger consideration of 1200 per share to take into account the 800 per share dividend paid to holders of mgm common stock on may 17 2004 however if the exercise price of an option has already been adjusted as a result of the 800 per share dividend paid on may 17 2004 or if such option was granted after may 17 2004 then the holder of such option will receive a payment equal to the excess or spread if any of 1200 per share over the pershare exercise price of the option 

  

as of the record date our executive officers and directors held options with a positive spread after giving effect to the 800 per share dividend to purchase a total of 12635264 shares of common stock all of which were granted prior to may 17 2004 the aggregate spread for these options is approximately 60297977 

  

deferred compensation plan 

  

our deferred compensation plan provides for certain portions of participants’ accounts under the plan to be paid a lump sum upon a “change in control” as defined in the plan a participant earns hypothetical rates of return on his account based upon the actual investment performance of funds chosen by the participant from a list made available by mgm upon a change in control all amounts credited to a participant’s account that are attributable to bonuses payable in shares of mgm common stock pursuant to the mgm senior management bonus plan will be distributed to the participant in a lump sum cash payment as soon as practicable after the change in control unless the participant has previously made an election within a prescribed time period to receive the distribution in quarterly installments over a period of between one and 15 years the merger would constitute a change in control for these purposes mr jones’ account includes shares of mgm common stock that are attributable to bonuses pursuant to the senior management bonus plan and since he has not made an election to defer the distribution of such amounts he will receive a lump sum payment in respect of such amounts as soon as practicable after the closing of the merger all other amounts credited to a participant’s account that are not attributable to deferrals of bonuses payable in shares of mgm common stock pursuant to the senior management bonus plan will be distributed to the participant in accordance with the otherwise applicable provisions of the deferred compensation plan 

  

exemption from section 16 

  

pursuant to the merger agreement the compensation committee has adopted and the board has ratified resolutions exempting our directors and executive officers from all liability under section 16b of the securities exchange act of 1934 related to the cancellation of their outstanding stock options in exchange for the payments described above under “—option payments” and the disposition of their shares of mgm common stock in exchange for the right to receive the merger consideration

michigan gaming control and revenue act provides that not more than three casinos may be licensed at any one time by the state of michigan and that they be located only in the city of detroit in november 1997 mgm grand detroit llc was selected to develop one of the three authorized hotelcasino complexes mgm grand detroit inc our wholly owned subsidiary holds a controlling interest in mgm grand detroit llc a minority interest in mgm grand detroit llc is held by partners detroit llc a michigan limited liability company owned by residents and entities located in the detroit metropolitan area 4 mgm grand detroit llc has operated an interim casino facility in downtown detroit since july 1999 in august 2002 the detroit city council approved revised development agreements with us and two other developers the revised development agreement released us and the city from certain of the obligations under the original agreement and significantly changed other provisions of the original agreement we are currently in the process of obtaining land and developing plans for the permanent facility and currently expect the project to cost approximately 575 million including land

facility are not finalized and the ultimate timing cost and scope of the facility are subject to risks attendant to largescale projects the ability to construct the permanent casino facility is

must apply for and receive numerous governmental permits and satisfy other conditions before construction of a new resort on the renaissance pointe site could begin no assurance can be given that we will develop a casino resort in new jersey or its ultimate schedule size configuration or cost if we do develop a casino resort   las vegas nevada we own an approximately 50acre site for future development with over 1200 feet of frontage on the las vegas strip between bellagio and monte carlo a part of which is occupied by the boardwalk the design timing and cost of any future development on the site will depend on several factors including the market’s ability to absorb new hotelcasino resorts on the las vegas strip competition from gaming outside of nevada and the ultimate size and scope of the project among other factors in 2002 we entered into an agreement with turnberry associates to develop luxury condominium towers at mgm grand las vegas we will initially contribute land and up to 3 million to the project for a 50 investment turnberry associates will contribute 9 million and up to an additional 3 million in cash and will manage the development and sales process the

subject to a definitive agreement regulatory approvals and certain legislative changes by the state of new york   other we regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the domestic and international markets these opportunities may include the ownership management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in nevada or in states other than nevada or outside of the united states we may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties development and operation of any gaming facility in a new jurisdiction is subject to many contingencies several of these contingencies are outside of our control and may include the passage of appropriate gaming legislation the issuance of necessary permits licenses and approvals the availability of appropriate financing and the satisfaction of other conditions we cannot be sure that we will decide or be able to proceed with any acquisition or expansion opportunities marketing all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours each day every day of the year we do not consider our business to be particularly seasonal we believe that the largest portion of our nevada customers live in southern california although other geographic areas are also important the level of gaming activity at our casinos is the single largest factor in determining our revenues and operating income we generate slightly over half of our net revenues from gaming activities we also receive a large amount of revenues from room food and beverage entertainment and retail operations since we believe that the number of walkin customers also affects the success of all of our hotelcasinos we design our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other hotels 6 the principal segments of the nevada and mississippi gaming markets are leisure travel premium gaming customers conventions including small meetings and corporate incentive programs and tour and travel bellagio mgm grand las vegas and the mirage appeal to the upper end of each market segment balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the midweek and offpeak periods our marketing strategy for ti and new yorknew york is aimed at attracting middle to uppermiddleincome wagerers largely from the leisure travel and to a lesser extent the tour and travel segments boardwalk and primm valley resorts appeal primarily to middleincome customers attracted by room food and beverage and entertainment prices that are lower than those offered by the major las vegas hotelcasinos we utilize our worldclass golf courses in marketing programs at our las vegas strip and other nevada resorts our major las vegas hotelcasinos offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at shadow creek in connection with our marketing activities we also invite our premium casino customers to play shadow creek on a complimentary basis we use primm valley golf club for marketing purposes at our las vegas and primm resorts including offering room and golf packages at special rates we believe beau rivage is the most luxurious hotelcasino on the mississippi gulf coast beau rivage seeks to attract the most affluent customers in each market segment particularly those who live in major cities in the south as well as customers residing in the gulf coast region mgm grand detroit markets primarily to customers within a 150mile radius of detroit its customers are attracted by its diverse gaming and dining offerings its convenient location and its ample onsite parking facilities mgm grand australia has targeted its local northern territory market for its primary customer base we advertise on radio television and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the united states as well as on the internet and by direct mail we also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major united states and foreign cities a key element of marketing to highlevel wagerers is personal contact by our marketing personnel direct marketing is also important in the convention segment we maintain internet websites which inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms and make restaurant and show reservations we utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in gaming as well our players club links seven of our united states resorts and consolidates all slots and table games activity for customers with a players club account customers qualify for benefits at all of these resorts regardless of where they play we believe that our players club enables us to more effectively market to our customers almost all of the slot machines at our united states resorts operate with international game technology’s ezpay™ cashless gaming system we believe that this system enhances the customer experience and increases the revenue potential of our slot machines issuance of markers marker play represents a large portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well with the exception of mgm grand australia where northern territory legislation prohibits marker play we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation in nevada mississippi and michigan amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are enforceable under state laws all other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid entered into in nevada mississippi or michigan pursuant to the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states a significant portion of our company’s accounts receivable for amounts unpaid resulting from markers which are not collectible through banking channels is owed by major casino customers from the far east the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries 7 supervision of gaming activities in connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements these audit and cash controls include  competition   las vegas our las vegas casino resorts compete with a large number of other hotelcasinos in the las vegas area including major hotelcasinos on or near the las vegas strip major hotelcasinos in the downtown area which is about five miles from the center of the strip and several major facilities elsewhere in the las vegas area according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority there were approximately 130000 guestrooms in las vegas at december 31 2003 up from approximately 127000 rooms at december 31 2002 las vegas visitor volume was 355 million in 2003 a slight increase from the 351 million reported for 2002 additional new hotelcasinos and expansion projects at existing las vegas hotelcasinos are under construction or have been proposed in addition further expansion of native american gaming in california is likely we are unable to determine to what extent increased competition will affect our future operating results   primm nevada the primm valley resorts compete primarily with two hotelcasinos located 11 miles north along interstate 15 in jean nevada and with the numerous other hotels and casinos in the las vegas area as well as native american gaming facilities in southern california since many of our current customers stop at primm as they are driving on interstate 15 to and from major casinohotels located in las vegas we believe that our success at primm is also favorably influenced by the popularity of the las vegas resorts the expansion of native american gaming has already had an impact on our primm valley resorts and the substantial expansion of native american gaming facilities in california which is currently anticipated could have a further adverse effect on the primm valley resorts   detroit mgm grand detroit competes in this market with two other interim casinos located in detroit as well as a governmentowned casino located nearby in windsor ontario there are native american casinos in michigan but none are near the detroit metropolitan area   biloxi mississippi beau rivage competes with 11 other casinos in the mississippi gulf coast market nine of which offer hotel accommodations gulf coast casinos also compete in the regional market with a landbased casino in new orleans and a landbased native american hotelcasino in central mississippi casinos in the gulf coast market also compete for the south florida market with casinos in the bahamas gulf coast casinos compete to a lesser extent with a number of casinos in mississippi and louisiana   australia the success of mgm grand australia depends in part upon a balance of i its ability to effectively serve the local community as well as ii its ability to make efficient use of its strategic proximity to the southeast asian gaming market the darwin international airport is an average of 55 hours away from the major asian cities however frequency of scheduled air service is a limiting factor 8 there are 13 casinos in australia competing for the far east market australian casinos operate under exclusive arrangements which create a regional monopoly for a fixed term as such australian casinos do not compete among themselves for the regional middle to lowend players however far east premium players have become an increasingly important source of revenues consequently this market has become very competitive due to the competition for premium play customers and the limitations on scheduled air service mgm grand australia has targeted the local market for its customer base which has produced relatively stable results   other our company’s facilities also compete for gaming customers with hotelcasino operations located in other areas of the united states and other parts of the world and for vacationers with nongaming tourist destinations such as hawaii and florida our hotelcasinos compete to a lesser extent with statesponsored lotteries offtrack wagering card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming in the united states in recent years certain states have legalized and several other states have considered legalizing casino gaming we do not believe that legalization or expansion of casino gaming in those jurisdictions would have a material adverse impact on our operations however we do believe that the legalization of largescale landbased casino gaming in or near certain major metropolitan areas particularly in california could have a material adverse effect on the las vegas market how we compete our major casino resorts compete on the basis of  the principal negative factors relating to our competitive position are  employees and labor relations as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 36000 fulltime and 7000 parttime employees of which approximately 3100 fulltime employees and 300 parttime employees worked at the golden nugget subsidiaries at that date we had collective bargaining contracts with unions covering approximately 17000 of our employees of which approximately 1400 employees worked at the golden nugget las vegas we do not have union contracts at beau rivage or the boardwalk we consider our employee relations to be good 9 regulation and licensing   nevada government regulation the ownership and operation of

facilities limitation conditioning or suspension of beau rivage resorts’ gaming license or mgm mirage’s registration as a publicly traded holding company of beau rivage resorts or the appointment of a supervisor could and the revocation of any gaming license or registration would materially adversely affect our mississippi gaming operations a licensed gaming subsidiary must pay license fees and taxes computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved to the state of mississippi and to the county or city in which the licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations depending upon the particular fee or tax involved these fees and taxes are payable either monthly quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of gross gaming revenues the number of slot machines operated by the casino and the number of table games operated by the casino the license fee payable to the state of mississippi is based upon “gaming receipts” generally defined as gross receipts less payouts to customers as winnings and generally equals 8 of gaming receipts these license fees are allowed as a credit against our mississippi income tax liability for the year paid the gross revenue fee imposed by the mississippi cities and counties in which casino operations are located is in addition to the fees payable to the state of mississippi and equals approximately 4 of the gaming receipts the mississippi gaming commission adopted a regulation in 1994 requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’s plan include a 500car parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities which will amount to at least 25 of the casino cost infrastructure facilities are defined in the regulation to include a hotel with at least 250 rooms theme park golf course and other similar facilities with the opening of its resort hotel and other amenities beau rivage resorts is in compliance with this requirement on january 21 1999 the mississippi gaming commission adopted an amendment to this regulation which increased the infrastructure requirement to 100 from the existing 25 however the regulation grandfathers existing licensees and applies only to new casino projects and casinos that are not operating at the time of acquisition or purchase and would therefore not apply to beau rivage resorts in any event beau rivage would comply with such requirement both the local jurisdiction and the alcoholic beverage control division of the mississippi state tax commission license control and regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages by beau rivage resorts beau rivage is in an area designated as a special resort area which allows casinos located therein to serve alcoholic beverages on a 24hour basis the alcoholic beverage control division requires that the key officers and managers of mgm mirage and beau rivage resorts and all owners of more than 5 of beau rivage resorts’ equity submit detailed personal and in some instances financial information to the alcoholic beverage control division and be investigated and licensed all such licenses are nontransferable the alcohol beverage control division has the full power to limit condition suspend or revoke any license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with or without conditions any disciplinary action could and revocation would have a material adverse effect upon the casino’s operations 20   australia government regulation the northern territory of australia has comprehensive laws and

 item 3 legal proceedings   poulos slot machine litigation on april 26 1994 an individual filed a complaint in a class action lawsuit in the united states district court for the middle district of florida against 41 manufacturers distributors and casino operators of video poker and electronic slot machines including the company on may 10 1994 another plaintiff filed a complaint in a class action lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in the same court against 48 defendants including the company on september 26 1995 another plaintiff filed a complaint in a class action lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in the united states district court for the district of nevada against 45 defendants including the company the court consolidated the three cases in the united states district court for the district of nevada the consolidated complaint claims that we and the other defendants have engaged in a course of fraudulent and misleading conduct intended to induce people to play video poker and electronic slot machines based on a false belief concerning how the gaming machines operate as well as the chances of winning specifically the plaintiffs allege that the gaming machines are not truly random as advertised to the public but are preprogrammed in a predictable and manipulative manner the complaint alleges violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act as well as claims of common law fraud unjust enrichment and negligent misrepresentation and asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages in december 1997 the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim and ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint which they filed in february 1998 we along with most of the other defendants answered the amended complaint and continue to deny the allegations contained in the amended complaint the parties have fully briefed the issues regarding class certification which are currently pending before the court 28 in june 2002 the us district court in nevada ruled that the plaintiffs met the prerequisite requirements for classaction status but the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for class action certification saying that the proposed class lacked the cohesiveness required to settle common claims against the casino industry the court had previously stayed discovery pending resolution of these class certification issues in august 2002 the 9 th circuit court of appeals granted the plaintiffs the right to appeal the district court’s order denying the motion for class certification briefings before the 9 th circuit court have been completed and oral arguments were presented in january 2004 a ruling from the 9 th circuit court is expected sometime in 2004   boardwalk shareholder litigation on september 28 1999 a former stockholder of our subsidiary which owns and operates the boardwalk hotel and casino filed a first amended complaint in a putative class action lawsuit in district court for clark county nevada against mirage and certain former directors and principal stockholders of the boardwalk subsidiary the complaint alleged that mirage induced the other defendants to breach their fiduciary duties to boardwalk’s minority stockholders by devising and implementing a scheme by which mirage acquired boardwalk at significantly less than the true value of its shares the complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages from mirage and punitive damages from the other defendants whom we are required to defend and indemnify in june 2000 the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted the plaintiff appealed the ruling to the nevada supreme court the parties filed briefs with the nevada supreme court and oral arguments were conducted in october 2001 in february 2003 the nevada supreme court overturned the district court’s order granting our motion to dismiss the complaint and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on the elements of the lawsuit involving wrongful conduct in approving the merger andor in the valuation of the merged corporation’s shares the nevada supreme court affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims for lost profits and mismanagement the nevada supreme court’s ruling relates only to the district court’s ruling on our motion to dismiss and is not a determination of the merits of the plaintiff’s case the plaintiff filed an amended complaint and in october 2003 the district court certified the action as a class action written discovery is underway and depositions are expected to occur sometime in 2004 we will continue to vigorously defend our position that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit   detroit slot machine litigation on july 18 2001 an individual mary kraft filed a complaint in the wayne county circuit court in detroit michigan against international game technology anchor gaming inc and the three operators of casinos in detroit michigan including a subsidiary of the company the plaintiff claims the bonus wheel feature of the wheel of fortune® and i dream of jeannie™ slot machines which are manufactured designed and programmed by international game technology andor anchor gaming inc are deceptive and misleading specifically plaintiff alleges that the bonus wheels on these games do not randomly land on a given dollar amount but are programmed to provide a predetermined frequency of payouts the complaint alleges violations of the michigan consumer protection act common law fraud and unjust enrichment and asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages disgorgement of profits injunctive and other equitable relief and costs and attorney’s fees the plaintiff seeks to certify a class of any individual in michigan who has played either of these games since june of 1999 the machines and their programs were approved for use by the michigan gaming control board the administrative agency responsible for policing the detroit casinos we along with the other casino operators filed a motion for summary disposition arguing that the plaintiff’s complaint fails to state a claim as a matter of law additionally we along with the other casino operators filed motions for summary disposition arguing that the plaintiff’s common law claims are preempted by the michigan act that the court has no jurisdiction to decide this matter and that all the allegations in the complaint regarding the alleged deceptive nature of the machines are directed to the manufacturers of the machines and are not the casinos’ responsibility in april 2002 the wayne county circuit court granted the motion for summary disposition the plaintiff appealed and after a full briefing of the case oral argument was held in november 2003 the michigan court of appeals has not yet issued a decision on the appeal   lac vieux litigation in january 2002 the 6 th circuit court of appeals ruled in the case of lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians v michigan gaming control board et al that a preference contained in the detroit casino selection process ordinance in detroit michigan violated the first amendment to the united states constitution the 6 th circuit court remanded the case to the federal district court to determine what relief was appropriate the company’s operating subsidiary had not been granted a preference by the city of detroit and was not originally a party to the lac vieux litigation in april 2002 such subsidiary intervened in the lac vieux litigation in order to protect its interest 29 in july 2002 the district court denied the lac vieux tribe’s request for a new casino development selection process in the city of detroit finding that the magnitude of such relief was not warranted and that the harm to the casino licensees and the city would be manifestly worse than any benefit the tribe might receive the district court declared that our subsidiary did not receive a preference and in fact was injured by the preference the federal district court determined that the only relief that it could equitably grant to the tribe was declaring the ordinance unconstitutional our subsidiary had previously petitioned the court for a ruling that its selection was valid in that it did not receive any preferences in the selection process in light of the ruling that no further relief would be granted to the tribe the court denied this motion on the ground of mootness the tribe appealed the district court’s ruling and the tribe requested that the district court enjoin the city from approving new development agreements with the three casino developers until resolution of the appeal by the 6 th circuit court the district court denied the request for the injunction and the appeal is pending our subsidiary filed a cross appeal of the district court’s denial of the subsidiary’s motion in september 2002 the 6 th circuit court issued an injunction pending appeal prohibiting the city from issuing construction permits to the developers and prohibiting the developers from commencing construction pending further action of the 6 th circuit court the parties completed briefings of the case in august 2003 we argued among other things that the preference provisions of the ordinance found unconstitutional are severable from the valid provisions of the ordinance and that our subsidiary was not eligible for and did not seek or receive a preference in the selection process the 6 th circuit court has not set a schedule for argument of the appeal in december 2003 the tribe and the owners of the two other casinos filed a joint motion

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   our current operations our operations consist of 12 whollyowned casino resorts and 50 investments in two other casino resorts including  we operate in one segment the operation of casino resorts which includes offering gaming hotel dining entertainment retail and other resort amenities slightly over half of our net revenues are derived from gaming activities a lower percentage than many of our competitors as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests including nongaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality we generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our las vegas strip resorts in 2003 over 75 of our net revenues and operating income was generated by whollyowned las vegas strip resorts we believe that we own the premier casino resorts on the las vegas strip and a main focus of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain that competitive advantage our concentration on the las vegas strip exposes us to certain risks outside of our control such as competition from other las vegas strip resorts including a major new competitor expected to open in 2005 and the impact from potential expansion of gaming in california this concentration also exposes us to risks related to tourism and the general economy including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events   key performance indicators as a resortbased company our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the highend gaming segment which can cause variability in our results key performance indicators related to revenue are  most of our revenue is essentially cashbased through customers wagering with cash or paying for nongaming services with cash or credit cards our resorts like many in the industry generate significant operating cash flow our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period including the timing of major las vegas conventions the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our highend customers and the level of play during major holidays including new year and chinese new year 33   overall outlook we have invested heavily in our existing operations in 2002 and 2003 and expect to continue to do so in 2004 our las vegas strip resorts require ongoing capital investment to maintain their competitive advantages we believe the investments in additional nongaming amenities we made in 2003 and our planned spending in 2004 will further position our resorts to capitalize on the expected continued economic recovery borgata which opened in july 2003 will have a more meaningful impact on our operating results in 2004 given a full year of operations mgm grand detroit operates in an interim casino facility and we have plans to develop a permanent casino resort though our ability to do so is currently limited pending resolution of certain litigation we expect the permanent casino resort to cost approximately 575 million a significant amount of which may be invested in 2004 and 2005 we have made several strategic agreements to take advantage of currently proposed gaming law reforms in the united kingdom the timing of adoption of these reforms if they are adopted at all is uncertain however we believe that the gaming market in the uk would be profitable assuming a reasonable tax and regulatory structure and a market in which our style of resorts and our management expertise would provide us with a competitive advantage in january 2004 we announced the proposed acquisition of wembley plc if completed this acquisition would provide us with a gaming facility in rhode island allowing us to further diversify into the northeast united states a gaming market we consider to be underserved wembley also owns several greyhound tracks in the united kingdom which could provide sites for additional casino development subject to the same risks and uncertainties as our other potential investments in the united kingdom we also own two premium casino development sites in existing markets one on the las vegas strip between bellagio and monte carlo and one at renaissance pointe in atlantic city adjacent to borgata the timing or extent of any development on these sites is uncertain   summary financial results the following table summarizes our results of operations  income from continuing operations decreased in 2003 due to lower operating income and higher interest expense resulting from lower capitalized interest and to a lesser extent increased borrowings our longterm debt increased approximately 6 primarily in the fourth quarter in order to fund capital investments and share repurchases in 2002 income from continuing operations increased as a result of the significant onetime expenses incurred in 2001 along with stable payroll expenses as a result of restructuring activity in late 2001 and a significantly lower provision for doubtful accounts also contributing to the increase in 2002 was significantly lower interest expense as variable interest rates decreased in 2002 and we reduced longterm debt by approximately 4 in 2002 results on a per share basis were positively impacted by a lower weighted average number of shares outstanding particularly in 2003 this is the result of share repurchases throughout 2002 and 2003 34   operating results the following table includes key information about our operating results  on a consolidated basis the most important factors and trends contributing to our operating performance over the last three years have been  as a result of the above trends our net revenues increased 3 in 2003 including a higher percentage increase in the second half of the year while increasing only 2 in 2002 new yorknew york experienced a 23 increase in net revenues due to the addition of zumanity  the newest show from cirque du soleil which opened in august 2003 and other amenities including a new irish pub nine fine irishmen which opened in july 2003 bellagio’s revenues were flat despite the negative effects of sars and the iraq war in early 2003 and having 17 of its standard rooms out of service in the fourth quarter bellagio’s revpar increased 7 for the year but on a base of fewer rooms due to an ongoing project to remodel all of bellagio’s standard rooms bellagio’s other indicators were also strong including a 5 increase in slot revenues similarly net revenues increased 3 at mgm grand las vegas with a higher rate of increase in the second half of 2003 due to increased nongaming spending and the addition of several new food and beverage outlets our operating income in 2003 decreased 6 due primarily to higher payroll and benefits expenses which constitutes slightly over half of our casino and hotel operations and general and administrative expenses total payroll and benefits was up 6 largely due to a 19 increase in health insurance costs along with 3 higher salaries and wages our contract with the culinary union covering approximately 13000 of our las vegas employees became effective june 1 2002 the contract calls for increases in wages and health and welfare contributions of 45 per year over the five year term of the contract the increase in payroll and benefits was partially offset by higher income from unconsolidated affiliates after borgata opened in july 2003 35 operating income at bellagio decreased 22 in 2003 due to the additional impact of the standard room remodel project new yorknew york’s operating income increased as a result of the contribution of zumanity and other new amenities mgm grand las vegas experienced a 5 decline in operating income in 2003 however excluding restructuring charges related to restaurant leases preopening and startup expenses related to new amenities and property transactions related to the construction of a new theatre this resort’s operating income would have increased 6 mgm grand las vegas’ 2004 results will benefit from the theatre which will house a show by cirque du soleil opening in mid2004 beau rivage’s operating income increased significantly over 2002 due to the positive impact of a remodeled and expanded buffet as well as several other new restaurants opened during 2003 and the conversion of a floor of standard rooms into suites also beau rivage recorded a charge of 8 million in 2002 for property damage related to tropical storm isidore while no such costs were incurred in 2003 corporate expense increased in 2003 due primarily to increased development activities and increased property taxes on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city new jersey in 2002 our operating income increased 24 a large factor in the increase was the significant onetime expenses incurred in 2001 in relation to the september 11 2001 attacks including restructuring charges and asset impairment charges excluding the impact of these charges and preopening and startup expenses operating income increased 13 largely due to stable payroll expenses as a result of restructuring activity in late 2001 and a significantly lower provision for doubtful accounts   operating results – detailed revenue information the following table presents detail of our net revenues  table games revenues decreased 2 in 2002 even with a slightly higher hold percentage resulting from the impacts of the september 11 attacks on our foreign highend customers and the impacts of the united states economy on our national customers table games revenues decreased 3 in 2003 as a slightly lower hold percentage and the impact of the iraq war and sars outbreak in early 2003 were not fully offset by strong volume levels over the latter half of 2003 slot revenues increased substantially in both 2002 and 2003 improvements were the result of enhanced marketing programs the impact of our players club rewards program which was implemented in our major resorts over 2002 and 2003 and the implementation of cashless gaming technology in 2003 a majority of slot machines at our major resorts now offer ticketin ticketout technology through international game technology’s ezpay™ system slot win percentages were consistent among all three periods noncasino revenue increased in 2003 primarily due to increased occupancy at our resorts which also drives the level of spending at food and beverage entertainment and retail outlets in addition we were able to increase the pricing for our rooms and other nongaming amenities our hotel results began to improve notably in the latter half of 2003 particularly at our las vegas strip resorts for the year ended december 31 2003 revpar at our las vegas strip resorts was 126 compared to 119 in 2002 an increase of 6 in 2002 other revenues included proceeds of 11 million for the termination of our management agreement covering four casinos in the republic of south africa 36   operating results – details of certain charges preopening and startup expenses consisted of the following  preopening and startup expenses related to borgata represent our share of the operating results of borgata prior to its july 2003 opening we expect preopening expenses to decrease in 2004 since there will be no preopening expenses related to borgata restructuring costs credit consisted of the following  in 2003 our primary restructuring activities included closing two marketing offices and terminating the related leases terminating a lease agreement with a restaurant tenant at mgm grand las vegas and closing the siegfried  roy show which resulted in a charge for employee severance costs in december 2002 we recorded a restructuring credit of 10 million related to a lease contract termination accrual originally recorded in june 2000 as we determined that payment under this obligation was not probable we recorded 3 million of restructuring charges in december 2002 related to contract termination costs for a restaurant lease and the efx show at mgm grand las vegas during the third and fourth quarters of 2001 management responded to a decline in business volumes caused by the september 11 attacks by implementing cost containment strategies which included a significant reduction in payroll and a refocusing of several of our marketing programs approximately 6700 employees on a fulltime equivalent basis were laid off or terminated resulting in a 22 million charge against earnings primarily related to the accrual of severance pay extended health care coverage and other related costs in connection with these personnel reductions as a result of improving business levels and our success at rehiring a substantial number of previously laid off or terminated employees management determined in the second quarter of 2002 that a portion of the remaining accrual was no longer necessary this resulted in a restructuring credit of 10 million in 2002 property transactions net consisted of the following  37 in 2003 we sold 315 acres of land in north las vegas nevada near shadow creek for approximately 55 million resulting in the 37 million gain reflected above prior to 2003 we classified gains and losses on routine assets sales or disposals as a nonoperating item at some resorts and as an operating item at other resorts we believe the preferable presentation of these items is as an element of operating income prior period statements have not been reclassified as such transactions were not material in the prior periods until 2003 demolition costs were typically capitalized as part of new construction we began expensing demolition costs on major construction projects as incurred on january 1 2003 and are accounting for this change in policy prospectively demolition costs were not material in prior periods demolition costs in 2003 relate to preparation for the bellagio standard room remodel bellagio expansion and new theatre at mgm grand las vegas impairments of assets to be disposed of in 2003 consisted primarily of assets related to the former efx show and restaurants closed during 2003 at mgm grand las vegas in 2002 tropical storm isidore caused property damage at beau rivage totaling 8 million including cleanup costs the amount of the writedown for damaged assets was determined based on the net book value of the assets and engineering estimates in connection with the revised development agreement in detroit we wrote off 5 million which was the net book value of previously incurred development costs associated with the riverfront permanent casino site 9 million offset by previously accrued obligations no longer required under the revised development agreement 4 million the 2001 writedown of the atlantic city boardwalk land resulted from a reassessment of the fair value of the land subsequent to the september 11 attacks the revised carrying value was based on comparable sales data adjusted for the impact of legislation authorizing largescale gaming in the state of new york which we believe had a negative impact on real estate values on the atlantic city boardwalk the remaining 2001 charge of 15 million relates to several assets abandoned during the quarter in response to the september 11 attacks primarily inprogress construction projects which we terminated after the attacks   nonoperating results the following table summarizes information related to interest on our longterm debt  interest cost decreased in 2002 from 2001 due to lower debt balances in 2002 and lower market interest rates which affect the rate we pay on our credit facilities interest capitalized declined from 79 million in 2001 to 62 million in 2002 due to the lower debt balances and interest rates described above and due to our october 2002 decision to suspend development of our whollyowned atlantic city development project capitalized interest decreased in 2003 due to the suspension of development in atlantic city in late 2002 and the mid2003 cessation of interest capitalization on the company’s investment in borgata which opened on july 3 2003 the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes  38 the effective income tax rate in 2003 was lower than in 2002 due to the reversal of certain tax reserves as a result of completion of irs audits for certain prior tax years and expiration of the irs statutes of limitations on other years excluding the reversal our effective income tax rate was 367 in both periods the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2002 was the result of higher income before taxes the items causing a difference between the federal statutory rate and our effective income tax rate primarily nondeductible expenses and state and foreign income taxes have not varied significantly between years in 2003 taxes paid increased from prior years primarily due to payments made to settle irs audits of prior years excluding these payments our taxes paid have generally been significantly lower than our income tax provision this is primarily due to accelerated tax depreciation and the utilization of tax credits primarily for alternative minimum tax paid in prior years we utilized the last of these credits in 2003 and we expect that our cash paid for taxes will increase accordingly in 2004 liquidity and capital resources   cash flows – summary our cash flows consisted of the following    cash flows – operating activities trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income excluding noncash charges since our business is primarily cashbased cash flow from operations in 2003 decreased from 2002 resulting from the decrease in operating income and higher cash paid for taxes in 2002 cash flow from operations increased but not to the same extent as operating income primarily because operating income in 2001 included significant noncash charges at december 31 2003 and 2002 we held cash and cash equivalents of 178 million and 211 million we require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts beyond our cash on hand we utilize a companywide cash management system to minimize the amount of cash held in banks funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central bank accounts and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our bank credit facilities 39   cash flows – investing activities 2003 capital expenditures were significantly higher than 2002 due largely to major projects at our existing resorts these projects included  expenditures on these four projects totaled approximately 275 million including capitalized interest costs related to implementing new slot technology including igt’s ezpay ™ system players club and other slot technology totaled approximately 42 million remaining expenditures were for general property improvements which amounts were consistent with prior year expenditures capital expenditures in 2002 were not significantly different than 2001 2002 expenditures included general property improvements at our resorts such as room remodel projects at the mirage and golden nuggetlas vegas new restaurant and nightclub development at several of our resorts and various other remodeling projects other capital expenditures included costs for new slot technology as well as preconstruction activities including capitalized interest in atlantic city a large portion of the 2001 capital expenditures related to general property improvements at our resorts such as the ongoing room refurbishment program at the mirage and restaurant and entertainment enhancements at mgm grand las vegas and new yorknew york other capital expenditures included the construction of the primm center at the primm valley resorts the completion of the mirage events center the acquisition of the building housing mgm grand detroit the acquisition of a new corporate aircraft and costs including capitalized interest associated with ongoing development projects investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily represent required contributions to borgata through december 31 2003 we had made 133 million of our required 136 million in cash contributions in 2002 we also contributed 44 million to monte carlo in connection with the joint venture’s retirement of the final 87 million of its outstanding debt   cash flows – financing activities in 2003 we issued 600 million of 6 senior notes due 2009 and repaid a net 285 million on our bank credit facilities the net proceeds of these financing activities were used to supplement operating cash flows fund capital expenditures and share repurchases in 2002 and 2001 we utilized our operating cash flow to reduce outstanding indebtedness by 270 million and 420 million while still funding significant capital expenditures and share repurchases our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase programs approved by our board of directors and publicly announced our share repurchase activity was as follows  at december 31 2003 we had 8 million shares available for repurchase under the november 2003 authorization 40   principal debt arrangements our longterm debt consists of publicly held senior and subordinated notes and bank credit facilities we pay fixed rates of interest ranging from 6 to 975 on the senior and subordinated notes we pay variable interest based on libor on the bank credit facilities we amended our bank credit facilities in november 2003 and our current senior credit facility is a 25 billion fiveyear facility with a syndicate of banks led by bank of america na our senior credit facility consists of a 15 billion revolving credit facility due november 2008 and a 10 billion term loan that will be paid down 20 over the final three years of the loan with the remainder due november 2008 our previous bank credit facilities consisted of a 20 billion credit facility maturing in may 2005 and a 525 million revolving credit facility due april 2 2004 as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 885 million of available liquidity under our bank credit facilities and our next maturity of public debt is 500 million due in february 2005 we can raise additional capital through our shelf registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission in 2000 which originally allowed us to issue up to a total of 275 billion of debt and equity securities from time to time in public offerings at december 31 2003 the shelf registration statement has 190 million in remaining capacity for the issuance of future debt or equity securities any future public offering of securities under the shelf registration statement will only be made by means of a prospectus supplement   other factors affecting liquidity in january 2004 we completed the sale of the golden nugget subsidiaries resulting in net cash proceeds to us of 213 million the proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility in february 2004 we entered into an agreement to sell our subsidiaries that own and operate mgm grand australia for a195 approximately 150 million subject to certain working capital adjustments we expect this transaction to be completed by the third quarter of 2004 subject to customary sales conditions and regulatory approvals in september 2003 standard  poor’s rating service lowered its rating on us including our corporate credit rating to one level below investment grade to ‘bb’ from ‘bbb’ in january 2002 moody’s investment services lowered its rating on our senior notes to one level below investment grade bal as a result of the moody’s downgrade substantially all of our assets other than assets of our foreign subsidiaries and certain assets in use at mgm grand detroit are pledged as collateral for our senior notes excluding subordinated notes and our bank credit facilities we do not believe the downgrades have had or will have a significant effect on our liquidity or our ability to secure shortterm or longterm financing subsequent to the downgrades we successfully amended our bank credit facilities and issued the 600 million senior notes both on pricing and other terms which were favorable and consistent with similar arrangements before the downgrades   future developments   detroit michigan mgm grand detroit llc in which we hold a controlling interest has operated an interim casino facility in detroit michigan since july 1999 in august 2002 the detroit city council approved revised development agreements with us and two other developers the revised development agreement released us and the city from certain of the obligations under the original agreement and significantly changed other provisions of the original agreement we are currently in the process of obtaining land and developing plans for the permanent facility and currently expect the project to cost approximately 575 million including land capitalized interest and preopening expenses but excluding approximately 115 million of payments to the city under the revised development agreement the design budget and schedule of the permanent facility are not finalized and the ultimate timing cost and scope of the facility are subject to risks attendant to largescale projects the ability to construct the permanent casino facility is currently subject to resolution of the lac vieux litigation pending resolution of this litigation the 6th circuit court of appeals has issued an injunction prohibiting the city and the developers from commencing construction pending further action of the 6th circuit court therefore we do not know when we will be able to commence construction of or complete the permanent facility 41   atlantic city new jersey we own approximately 149 acres on renaissance pointe in atlantic city new jersey we obtained the land at renaissance pointe through an agreement between mirage and the city of atlantic city in addition borgata occupies 29 acres at renaissance pointe including 27 acres it owns and two acres we lease to borgata of the remaining land approximately 95 acres are suitable for development and a portion of these acres consists of common roads landscaping and master plan improvements which we designed and developed as required by our agreement with boyd in october 2002 we announced the temporary suspension of our development activities on our whollyowned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city we must apply for and receive numerous governmental permits and satisfy other conditions before construction of a new resort on the renaissance pointe site could begin no assurance can be given that we will develop a casino resort in new jersey or its ultimate schedule size configuration or cost if we do develop a casino resort   las vegas nevada we own an approximately 50acre site for future development with over 1200 feet of frontage on the las vegas strip between bellagio and monte carlo part of which is occupied by our boardwalk the design timing and cost of any future development on the site will depend on several factors including the market’s ability to absorb new development on the las vegas strip competition from gaming outside of nevada and the ultimate size and scope of the project among other factors in 2002 we entered into an agreement with turnberry associates to develop luxury condominium towers at mgm grand las vegas we will initially contribute land and up to 3 million to the project for a 50 investment turnberry associates will contribute 9 million and up to an additional 3 million in cash and will manage the development and sales process the venture will obtain construction financing for the remainder of the expected 175 million to 200 million cost of the first tower once sufficient presales have occurred to obtain financing we will have the opportunity to rent the condominiums to third parties on behalf of owners who elect to have us do so depending on market acceptance of the initial tower we and turnberry associates may develop on similar terms up to an additional five condominium towers   united kingdom in anticipation of reforms to gambling legislation currently being considered by the british government we have

olympia to complement the existing olympia facilities we made a deposit of £2 million 3 million based on exchange rates at december 31 2003 which is refundable if proposed gaming law reforms are not implemented by december 2005 otherwise the deposit will be applied to the first year’s rent on a lease between the new company and earls court and olympia we would make a nominal equity investment and

nyra agreed to pay a fine and the indictment will be dismissed with prejudice upon nyra implementing certain reforms and otherwise complying with the terms of the agreement our participation is subject to a definitive agreement regulatory approvals and certain legislative changes by the state of new york   off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates which currently consist of our investments in monte carlo and borgata we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the benefits of owning a fullscale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment we have not guaranteed financing obtained by the ventures nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort at december 31 2003 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 52 million of which 50 million support the bonds issued by the economic development corporation of the city of detroit these bonds are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets this obligation was undertaken to secure our right to develop a permanent casino in detroit   commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december 31 2003   43 other significant operating uses of cash in 2004 include interest and tax payments our cash payments for interest ranged from 266 million to 318 million over the past three years and we would expect similar levels of cash payments for interest in 2004 as discussed earlier our cash paid for income taxes in 2004 will likely increase over 2003 other significant investing uses of cash flow in 2004 include uncommitted capital expenditures expected to be approximately 300 million exclusive of any spending on a permanent casino in detroit and the proposed wembley acquisition valued at 490 million on the date we made the offer we plan to fund our contractual obligations and other estimated spending through a combination of operating cash flow proceeds from known or expected sales of businesses and available borrowings under our senior credit facility we have generated over 700 million in operating cash flow in each of the past three years which included deductions for interest payments tax payments and certain contractually committed payments reflected in the above table including operating leases employment agreements and entertainment agreements we expect to generate a similar level of operating cash flow in 2004 assuming operating cash flow is used to fund the remaining contractual commitments of approximately 500 million to 600 million we would have at least 100 million of operating cash flow available for other planned expenditures other sources of cash include the net proceeds of 213 million received in january 2004 upon closing the sale of the golden nugget subsidiaries the net proceeds of 150 million from the sale of mgm grand australia if the sale closes as expected by the third quarter of 2004 and the 885 million of available borrowings under our senior credit facility critical accounting policies and estimates management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and generally to a lesser extent cash flows senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates   allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio mgm grand las vegas and the mirage our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well with the exception of mgm grand australia where northern territory legislation prohibits marker play we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices personal contacts the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states at december 31 2003 and 2002 approximately 53 and 57 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states a significant portion of our casino accounts receivable is owed by casino customers from the far east at december 31 2003 and 2002 approximately 30 and 28 respectively of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east we maintain an allowance or reserve for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts the provision for doubtful accounts an operating expense increases the allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts at resorts where marker play is not significant the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances at resorts where marker play is significant we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount based on the age of the account the customer’s financial condition collection history and any other known information we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 44 the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries because individual customer account balances can be significant the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables  the allowance percentage increased in 2001 as a result of the impact of the september 11 attacks on our customers’ traveling patterns and the global economy as well as the impacts of declines in the united states stock markets through 2000 and 2001 during 2002 the united states stock markets continued to decline but we experienced better than anticipated receivable collections on certain customer accounts during 2002 which resulted in a reversal of previously recorded bad debt provision in the third quarter of 2002 in the fourth quarter of 2003 we recorded an additional reversal of bad debt provision as we again experienced better than expected collections the current strength in the united states economy and recent united states stock market gains have also caused us to positively adjust our outlook on collectibility of domestic accounts receivable the above economic and collection trends are reflected in the improved quality of our receivables statistics in the above table our reserve percentage at december 31 2003 is lower than it has been since the events of september 11 2001 though still higher than the periods preceding september 11 2001 at december 31 2003 a 100 basispoint change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by 2 million or 001 per share   fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies property and equipment are stated at cost maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets we account for construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” when we construct assets we capitalize direct costs of the project including fees paid to architects and contractors property taxes and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary mgm mirage design group we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment when constructing or purchasing assets we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired which also may be a matter of judgment our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets engineering studies and our estimate of the usage of the asset whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset we account for the change prospectively in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 34 “capitalization of interest cost” “sfas 34” interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weightedaverage cost of our outstanding borrowings since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project capitalization of interest starts when construction activities as defined in sfas 34 begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 45 whether we capitalize interest on a project depends in part on management’s actions in january 2001 we announced that our nearterm development focus would be on the atlantic city market as a result we suspended the capitalization of interest on our las vegas strip project until the development process for that project is further advanced interest capitalized on this project was 3 million in 2001 in october 2002 we announced the suspension of development activities on our whollyowned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city in connection with that announcement we stopped capitalizing interest associated with the project interest capitalized on this project for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2002 was 60 million and 41 million respectively   impairment of longlived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” for assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales solicited offers or a discounted cash flow model for assets to be held and used we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the asset if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value no impairment is indicated if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset typically measured using a discounted cash flow model if an asset is still under development future cash flows include remaining construction costs all recognized impairment losses whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses there are several estimates assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of longlived assets first management must determine the usage of the asset to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist this means that some assets must be grouped and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates on a quarterly basis we review our major longlived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets when appropriate we discount future cash flows using our weightedaverage cost of capital developed using a standard capital asset pricing model whenever an impairment loss is recorded or a test for impairment is made we discuss the facts and circumstances with the audit committee see “results of operations” for discussion of writedowns and impairments recorded in 2001 2002 and 2003 in october 2002 we announced the temporary suspension of our development activities on our whollyowned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city in connection therewith we reviewed the land for potential impairment and determined no impairment was indicated in december 2002 in connection with our agreement with turnberry associates whereby we are required to contribute land to the venture we reviewed the land for potential impairment and determined no impairment was indicated in june 2003 we entered into an agreement to sell the golden nugget subsidiaries the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated in february 2004 we entered into an agreement to sell mgm grand australia the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value therefore no impairment was indicated other than the above items we are not aware of events or circumstances that would cause us to review any material longlived assets for impairment   income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we account for income taxes according to statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” sfas 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets net of applicable reserves related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not otherwise a valuation allowance is applied 46 at december 31 2003 we had 90 million of deferred tax assets and 18 billion of deferred tax liabilities except for certain new jersey state net operating losses and certain other new jersey state deferred tax assets we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income the valuation allowance at december 31 2003 related to the new jersey deferred tax assets was 10 million our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities to determine necessary reserves we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities partially based on past experiences our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period in which the examination issues are settled in december 2002 we settled the irs audit of the company’s 1995 and 1996 tax returns which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position during 2003 we filed amended returns for tax years subsequent to 1996 to reflect the impact of the irs audits of the 1993 through 1996 tax years on those subsequent years in the fourth quarter of 2003 the statutes of limitations expired for the 1997 through 1999 tax years resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of 13 million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes the tax returns for years after 1999 are subject to possible future examination a portion of our tax reserves was assumed in the mirage acquisition the irs audit of the tax returns of mirage through the merger date was settled in august 2003 resulting in a payment to the irs of 45 million including interest these matters had been previously reserved for so the settlement had no impact on our income tax provision or our results of operations any future adjustments to the acquired mirage tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill accounting principles adopted in 2003   classification of gains and losses as extraordinary items in april 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 145 “rescission of fasb statements 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement 13 and technical corrections as of april 2002” “sfas 145” the key provision of sfas 145 that affects us rescinds the existing rule that all gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items instead such gains and losses must be analyzed to determine if they meet the criteria for extraordinary item classification based on the event being both unusual and infrequent we adopted sfas 145 beginning january 1 2003 prior period losses were analyzed to determine if they met the criteria to be classified as extraordinary items our prior period losses were reclassified as an element of income from continuing operations   costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “sfas 146” sfas 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan as previously required under eitf issue 943 examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs associated with a restructuring discontinued operation plant closing or other exit or disposal activity sfas 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 we adopted sfas 146 beginning january 1 2003 the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position the time between our commitment to an exit or disposal plan and when costs are actually incurred is typically short 47   guarantee obligations in november 2002 the fasb issued its interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” “fin 45” fin 45 requires that future guarantee obligations be recognized as liabilities at inception of the guarantee contract it also increases the disclosures required for current and future guarantee obligations we have included the disclosures required by fin 45 in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements we adopted the initial recognition provisions of fin 45 beginning january 1 2003 the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position   stockbased compensation in december 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” “sfas 148” sfas 148 increases the disclosure requirements for companies which do not voluntarily adopt the fair value based accounting for employee stock compensation prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” on a retroactive basis sfas 148 also requires companies to present the pro forma disclosures in interim financial statements we have included the annual disclosures required by sfas 148 in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and began presenting the required interim disclosures in 2003 recently issued accounting standards there are no accounting standards issued before december 31 2003 but effective after december 31 2003 which are expected to have a material impact on our financial reporting market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our longterm debt we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our longterm fixed rate borrowings and shortterm borrowings under our bank credit facilities and commercial paper program in the third quarter of 2003 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges which effectively convert 400 million of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt under the terms of these agreements we make payments based on specified spreads over sixmonth libor and receive payments equal to the interest payments due on the fixed rate debt the interest rate swap agreements qualify for the “shortcut method” allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 which allows an assumption of no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship as such there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments the following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of december 31 2003   as of december 31 2003 after giving effect to the interest rate swaps discussed above longterm fixed rate borrowings represented approximately 64 of our total borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint change in libor our annual interest cost would change by approximately 20 million 48

the motion picture and television industry 

  

motion pictures—general the motion picture industry consists of two principal activities production and distribution production involves the development financing and production of featurelength motion pictures distribution involves the promotion and exploitation of motion pictures throughout the world in a variety of media including theatrical exhibition home entertainment television and other ancillary markets the us motion picture industry can be divided into major studios and independent companies with the major studios dominating the industry in the number of theatrical releases in addition to us including mgm studios mgm pictures ua films and orion the major studios as defined by the motion picture association of america are the walt disney company including buena vista touchstone and miramax films paramount pictures corporation sony pictures entertainment inc including columbia pictures twentieth century fox film corp universal studios inc and warner bros including turner new line cinema and castle rock entertainment the major studios are typically large diversified corporations that have strong relationships with creative talent exhibitors and others involved in the entertainment industry and have global film production and distribution capabilities 

  

historically the major studios have produced and distributed the majority of high grossing theatrical motion pictures released annually in the united states over the past twelve years the number of featurelength motion pictures released by the major studios has increased from 158 in 1990 399 percent of the total to 284 in 2002 444 percent of the total in addition most of the studios have created or accumulated substantial and valuable motion picture libraries that generate significant revenues these revenues can provide the major studios with a stable source of earnings that partially offsets the variations in the financial performance of their current motion picture releases and other aspects of their motion picture operations 

  

the independent companies generally have more limited production and distribution capabilities than do the major studios while certain independent companies may produce as many films as a major studio in any year independent motion pictures typically have lower negative costs and are not as widely released as motion pictures produced and distributed by the major studios additionally the independent companies may have limited or no internal distribution capability and may rely on the major studios for distribution and financing 

  

motion picture production the production of a motion picture begins with the screenplay adaptation of a popular novel or other literary work acquired by the producer of the motion picture or the development of an original screenplay based upon a story line or scenario conceived or acquired by the producer in the development phase the producer may seek production financing and tentative commitments from a director the principal cast members and other creative personnel a proposed production schedule and budget are prepared at the end of this phase the decision is made whether or not to “greenlight” or approve for production the motion picture 

  

after greenlighting preproduction of the motion picture begins in this phase the producer engages creative personnel to the extent not previously committed finalizes the filming schedule and production budget obtains insurance or self insures and secures completion guaranties if necessary moreover the producer establishes filming locations secures any necessary studio facilities and stages and prepares for the start of actual filming 

  

  

principal photography or the actual filming of the screenplay generally extends from seven to 16 weeks depending upon such factors as budget location weather and complications inherent in the screenplay following completion of principal photography the motion picture enters what is typically referred to as postproduction in this phase the motion picture is edited opticals dialogue music and any special effects are added and voice effects and music soundtracks and pictures are synchronized this results in the production of the negative from which release prints of the motion picture are made major studios and independent film companies hire editors composers and special effects technicians on the basis of their suitability for a particular picture 

  

the production and marketing of theatrical motion pictures requires substantial capital the costs of producing and marketing motion pictures have increased substantially in recent years these costs may continue to increase in the future at rates greater than normal inflation thereby increasing the costs to us of our motion pictures production costs and marketing costs are generally rising at a faster rate than increases in either domestic admissions to movie theaters or admission ticket prices leaving us and all producers of motion pictures more dependent on other media such as home entertainment and television and foreign markets 

  

motion picture distribution the distribution of a motion picture involves the licensing of the picture for distribution or exploitation in various markets both domestically and internationally pursuant to a release pattern these markets include theatrical exhibition nontheatrical exhibition which includes airlines hotels and armed forces facilities home video including rental and sellthrough presentation on television including payperview pay network syndication and basic cable and marketing of the other rights in the picture and underlying literary property which may include publishing merchandising and soundtracks the domestic and international markets generally follow the same release pattern with the starting date of the release in the international market varying from being concurrent with the domestic theatrical release to being as long as nine months afterwards a motion picture typically is distributed by a major studio or one or more distributors that acquire rights from a studio or other producer in one or more markets or media or a combination of the foregoing 

  

both major studios and independent film companies often acquire pictures for distribution through a customary industry arrangement known as a “negative pickup” under which the studio or independent film company agrees before commencement of or during production to acquire from a production company all rights to a film upon completion of production and also acquire completed films as well as all associated obligations 

  

television production the production of television series programming involves the development of a format based on a creative concept or literary property into a television script the hiring of talent the filming or taping of the program and the technical and postproduction work necessary to produce a finished program television producers may originate projects internally or acquire them from others if a concept is deemed suitable for development the studio or other producer or network typically commissions and pays for a script once a script is ordered one or more license agreements are negotiated with the potential broadcasters of such program a pilot episode usually is ordered or commissioned prior to the determination of whether a series will be produced 

  

television production can generally be divided into two distinct markets network production consisting of a production for the broadcast networks ie abc cbs nbc fox upn and wb and madeforcable networks ie pay and basic cable networks and b firstrun syndication production the economics of the two types of television production are different in broadcast network and madeforcable network production a network generally orders a minimum number of initial episodes approximately six to 13 episodes if produced for a broadcast network and approximately 13 to 22 episodes if produced for a cable network of each new series for a license fee equal to a percentage of the program’s cost the balance of the production cost for such shows which is customarily lower for madeforcable productions than for productions made for broadcast networks can only be recouped through international sales syndication and second run domestic basic cable sales if a series is successful and generally remains unrecouped for at least four years in the firstrun syndication 

  

production business a producer seeking to launch a new series commits to produce a minimum number of episodes if the producer can “clear” the series by selling to individual television stations in sufficient markets throughout the country generally comprising at least 75 percent of us television households once produced the episodes are immediately available for licensing to international broadcasters as well and can subsequently be licensed to a domestic basic cable network this approach generally involves a lower production cost risk and earlier return on investment than the network production business however firstrun syndicated programming generally reduces the potential total return on investment as compared to successful network production see “—production—television production” 

  

television distribution the us television market is served by network affiliated stations independent stations and cable systems although the number of independent stations has decreased as many formerly independent stations have become affiliated with new networks in recent years during “prime time” hours network affiliates primarily broadcast programming produced for the network in nonprime time network affiliates telecast network programming offnetwork programming firstrun programming programming produced for distribution on a syndicated basis and programming produced by the local stations themselves independent television stations and cable networks during both prime and nonprime time produce their own programs and telecast offnetwork programs or firstrun programs acquired from independent producers or syndicators syndicators generally are companies that sell to independent television stations and network affiliates programming produced or acquired by the syndicator for distribution

maintain film and television production while improving our risk profile we intend to conduct our production business in a financially disciplined manner by 

  

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

we intend to produce or coproduce and distribute seven to ten motion pictures annually through mgm pictures across a variety of genres through ua films we also intend to distribute annually an additional ten to 15 specialty motion pictures that will have substantially lower average costs and will be produced mainly by third parties 

  

we plan to develop produce and distribute television programs focusing in part on low financial risk formats such as preclearing a television series for distribution prior to committing to development expenditures as well as joint ventures coproductions and other partnering arrangements for certain of our series 

  

increase distribution revenues we have taken steps to obtain greater flexibility in distributing our own product to enable us to realize additional revenue opportunities while reducing the costs associated with distribution in 1999 we terminated our agreement with warner home video so that on february 1 2000 we regained full control over the home video exploitation of our films on october 31 2000 we completed our withdrawal from united international pictures uip with respect to the international theatrical distribution of our films we executed the transition of our international home video and theatricalnontheatrical distribution from warner home video and uip to fox to gain more control over our international distribution in those media and to maximize our revenue opportunities 

  

we plan to increase distribution revenues by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

capitalize on a well recognized brand name we believe that the mgm name and lion logo are among the most recognized in the world we intend to capitalize on the value inherent in our name and logo through the distribution of branded programming and the development of consumer products 

  

we believe that mgm should consider either growing into or becoming part of a larger vertically integrated organization through business combinations or other strategic alternatives in order to maximize the value of mgm’s assets to that end mgm has been regularly evaluating business combination opportunities and other strategic alternatives as opportunities arise and intends to continue to do so as of the date hereof no agreements regarding a transaction of such nature have been reached and there can be no assurance that mgm will decide to enter into any such transaction in addition business combinations and other strategic alternatives involve numerous risks including diversion of management’s attention away from our operating activities and the possibility that we would need to incur substantial additional debt we cannot assure you that we will not encounter unanticipated problems or liabilities with respect to any business combinations that may be completed by mgm nor can we assure you that the anticipated benefits of any such transactions will be achieved 

  

  

film and television library 

  

we currently own or hold certain distribution rights to approximately 4000 theatrically released motion pictures our library also contains the largest collection of feature films produced since 1948 in 1948 certain major studios negotiated consent decrees requiring that the studios separate their exhibition businesses from their production and distribution businesses and mandating the divestiture of certain theater holdings this is generally believed to have triggered greater competition among the studios and an increased emphasis on the potential for commercial success in the development and production stages resulting in a greater focus on the content and quality of the motion pictures produced and distributed by the studios we believe that films produced and developed after 1948 generally are more valuable than pre1948 films a number of which are black and white 

  

in addition to being the largest modern motion picture library in the world our library is also one of the most critically acclaimed libraries in the motion picture industry representing one of the largest collections of academy awardwinning films the motion pictures in our library have won over 200 academy awards fourteen motion pictures in our library have won the academy award for best picture annie hall the apartment the best years of our lives dances with wolves hamlet in the heat of the night marty midnight cowboy platoon rain man rocky the silence of the lambs tom jones and west side story 

  

our library also includes over 10200 episodes from television series previously broadcast on primetime network television cable or in firstrun syndication including episodes of the addams family american gladiators bat masterson cagney  lacey fame green acres highway patrol in the heat of the night mr ed the patty duke show pink panther sea hunt and thirtysomething the television programs in our library have won among others 108 emmy awards and 17 golden globe awards 

  

our library includes titles from a wide range of genres including dramas comedies actionadventure movies westerns and suspense thrillers we believe that our library’s diversity quality and extensive size provides us with substantial competitive advantages we seek to continue to build upon these advantages by producing and acquiring new motion pictures across a variety of genres and budget ranges to update and enhance our library see “—production—motion picture production” 

  

we will continue to implement the strategy of developing new projects from existing library assets our library represents a readilyavailable “market tested” source of development ideas for example in 1999 we had success with the remake of the thomas crown affair and in 1995 we had success with the birdcage  a remake of la cage aux folles  furthermore we have successfully expanded the valuable film franchises within our library most notably the james bond franchise with the commercial success of goldeneye in 1995 tomorrow never dies in 1997 the world is not enough in 1999 and die another day in 2002 additionally we have successfully developed television series based on library motion pictures such as poltergeist the legacy based on poltergeist stargate sg1 based on stargate and all dogs go to heaven based on the movie of the same name we also have produced a remake of twelve angry men and inherit the wind as madefortelevision movies for showtime networks and carrie as a madefortelevision movie for nbc 

  

we together with danjaq llc are the sole owners of all of the james bond motion pictures in addition to the recently released james bond picture die another day  19 james bond motion pictures in our library were produced and are distributed pursuant to a series of agreements with danjaq the james bond motion pictures are produced by danjaq and we have the right to approve all key elements of the pictures such as the selection of the director and the leading actors the copyright in each of the motion pictures is owned jointly by mgm and danjaq generally we have the right to distribute each of the pictures in all media worldwide in perpetuity or for a term of 15 years where our distribution rights are not perpetual the rights revert to joint control by mgm and danjaq after expiration of the distribution term the 15year distribution term for the living daylights expired in 2002 and we are in the process of negotiating a renewal of the distribution term with danjaq danjaq controls certain merchandising rights with respect to the pictures and we are entitled to receive a portion of the revenues from danjaq’s merchandising licenses additionally we control all the marketing rights and the music from the 

  

living daylights 1987 and all subsequent pictures all other rights relating to the pictures are controlled jointly by mgm and danjaq the agreements contain certain restrictions on the sale or licensing by mgm of any of our rights in the pictures 

  

in 1998 we acquired the rights to never say never again  produced by warner bros and taliafilms and in 1999 we acquired the distribution rights to casino royale  produced by columbia and famous artists productions a subsidiary of mgm accordingly our library now contains every james bond motion picture ever made and we are the only studio to hold such rights 

  

we seek aggressively to market and distribute titles in our film library in existing pay and free television home video and other markets worldwide we believe that the size of our library allows us to minimize the over exploitation of any title and therefore better preserve the ongoing value of our library by actively managing the rotation of titles through such markets as of december 31 2002 approximately 83 percent of the theatrical motion picture titles and approximately 95 percent of the television title episodes in our library have been exploited 

  

we also seek aggressively to market and distribute our titles through developing technology see “—distribution—home video distribution” we believe that the development and growth of direct broadcast satellite and other new distribution systems may generate significant incremental profits for the industry as the number of channels requiring content grows 

  

we have differing types of rights to the various titles in our library in some cases we own the title outright with the right to exploit the title in all media and territories for an unlimited time in other cases the title may be owned by a third party and we may have obtained the right to distribute the title in certain media and territories for a limited term even if we own a title we may have granted rights to exploit the title in certain media and territories to others as of december 31 2002 we owned outright or had been granted rights in perpetuity to approximately 65 percent of the titles in our library our rights in the other library titles are limited in time and pursuant to the terms of the existing arrangements the rights granted to us expire with respect to approximately three percent of the library over the next two years  ie through the end of 2004 with respect to another approximately 24 percent over the seven years thereafter from 2005 to 2012 and with respect to another approximately eight percent thereafter from 2012 on we have generally been able to renew such rights on acceptable terms however we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so in the future in accordance with industry practice for purposes of calculating the size of the library we include any title that we have the right to distribute in any territory in any media for any term 

  

certain longterm prepaid licenses were entered into before 1993 by a prior management as of december 31 2002 the titles included in these licenses represent a crosssection of the titles in the library including approximately 33 percent of all pre1990 mgm and ua titles which remain under license in one or more of the us france and spain and approximately 37 percent of the orion and polygram titles which remain under license to television in one or more of france spain germany and the united kingdom see “—distribution—television distribution” we expect to benefit as certain rights to the library that have been previously licensed to others revert to us over time see “—distribution” 

  

because we have historically derived approximately 35 to 40 percent of our revenues from nonus sources our business is subject to risks inherent in international trade many of which are beyond our control these risks include changes in laws and policies affecting trade investment and taxes including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and to withholding taxes differing degrees of protection for intellectual property financial instability and increased market concentration of buyers in foreign television markets including in european pay television markets the instability of foreign economies and governments fluctuating foreign exchange rates and war and acts of terrorism see “—regulation” “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

  

  

production 

  

motion picture production 

  

we currently develop and produce theatrical motion picture projects through two separate production entities mgm pictures and ua films mgm pictures concentrates on developing and producing mainstream major studio budget level films ua films concentrates on developing producing and acquiring specialized films with a net cost of less than 100 million both production units are supported by centralized marketing sales legal physical production and distribution functions 

  

mgm pictures plans to distribute approximately seven to ten motion pictures annually across a variety of genres and budget ranges mgm pictures employs a development staff of creative executives who refine concepts and scripts so that projects are developed to the point that production decisions can be made mgm pictures has entered into production alliances with a select group of producers many of them genrespecific these producers will develop and produce motion pictures exclusively or semiexclusively for mgm pictures and will use their relationships and creative abilities to provide another source of product for mgm pictures the seven to ten pictures distributed by mgm pictures are anticipated to be a combination of internally developed pictures pictures developed andor produced by the allied producers pictures which are coproduced or cofinanced with other major studios or independent partners and pictures acquired through negative pickups or other distribution arrangements mgm pictures’ strategy is to both increase creative diversity and mitigate financial risk in connection with motion picture production we expect to enhance creative diversity by employing the production alliance strategy discussed above and by entering into selective production agreements with successful established producers 

  

we also intend to seek to spread the financial risk inherent in motion picture production as well as increase the breadth of our release slate by entering into coproduction andor cofinancing arrangements as an example of this strategy in july 1999 we entered into an agreement with miramax films pursuant to which mgm and miramax would jointly produce finance and distribute motion pictures the agreement terminated in july 2002 but we retain a profit participation in the motion picture cold mountain  

  

we have also entered into a cofinancing deal for the upcoming dramatic motion picture it runs in the family in which we retained domestic distribution rights and a cofinancing deal for the upcoming martial arts motion picture bulletproof monk in which we retained domestic distribution rights distribution rights to certain foreign territories and worldwide ancillary rights 

  

we have established ua films as a new yorkbased artistfriendly haven for quality independent films which will release approximately ten to 15 motion pictures each year these motion pictures will be produced or coproduced by ua films or acquired through negative pickups or other distribution arrangements and will include some motion pictures in a variety of genres generally involving producers directors writers or other talent who typically work outside of the studio system as well as lower budget films from established filmmakers our investment in such pictures is expected to be significantly less than our investment for pictures produced through mgm pictures we believe that this strategy of releasing specialty motion pictures will add greater diversity to our release slate and enhance the library both through the addition of new film product and the building of relationships with upandcoming producers and directors writers and other talent in march 2000 we entered into an agreement with filmmaker francis ford coppola’s production company american zoetrope for the financing and distribution in the us and canada of up to ten lowerbudget motion pictures to be produced by zoetrope for ua films over a threeyear period under the agreement we have a “firstlook” on such projects developed by zoetrope this agreement was scheduled to expire on march 3 2003 but has been extended for six months until september 3 2003 

  

compared to other major studios we believe we have entered into and intend to pursue fewer traditional producer or talent “overhead” arrangements in which a studio pays a portion of the overhead of creative talent ie producer director or actor for the right to receive a “first look” at that party’s projects we generally 

  

believe that our capital resources are better allocated to acquire literary properties or the services of talent for a specific project in addition our current business plan also calls for our annual release slates to be comprised of proportionately fewer large budget “event” motion pictures than the current release slates of the other major studios 

  

we do not own any studio facilities or stages but lease facilities and sound stages on an “as needed” basis in connection with the production of specific motion picture and television projects we have not experienced any difficulties in leasing appropriate facilities and sound stages when needed 

  

motion picture production and distribution is highly speculative and inherently risky there can be no assurance of the economic success of any motion picture since the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a motion picture which do not necessarily bear a direct correlation to the production or distribution costs incurred depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public which cannot be predicted the commercial success of a motion picture also depends upon the acceptance of competing films released into the marketplace at or near the same time the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty further the theatrical success of a motion picture is generally a key factor in generating revenues from other distribution channels there is a substantial risk that some or all of our motion pictures will not be commercially successful resulting in costs not being recouped or anticipated profits not being realized see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

the following table details our tentative 2003 domestic theatrical release schedule 

  

release schedule 

  

   

   

   

we may revise the release date of a motion picture as the production schedule changes or in such a manner as we believe is likely to maximize revenues additionally there can be no assurance that any of the motion pictures scheduled for release will be completed that completion will occur in accordance with the anticipated schedule or budget or that the motion pictures will necessarily involve all of the creative talent listed above see the discussion above in “—motion picture production” 

  

television production 

  

we have in the past engaged in the development and production of episodic television series miniseries and movies for distribution on domestic and international television networks local independent and network affiliated television stations pay television networks basic cable networks and home video since the reestablishment of our television series production operations in 1994 we have obtained commitments for approximately 1411 hours of television programming of which approximately six percent remained to be aired as of december 31 2002 

  

  

our strategy has been to focus on the development and production of series for cable television and the firstrun syndication market which involves a lower production investment risk and movies and miniseries for both network and offnetwork broadcasters as part of our strategy in 1994 we entered into a programming arrangement with showtime whereby we provided television series and movies for premiere on showtime showtime agreed to license from us exclusive us pay television rights to the following television series a 132 hours six seasons of the outer limits winner of the cable ace award for best dramatic series in 1995 and 1996 all of which have aired b 66 episodes three seasons of poltergeist the legacy all of which have aired and c 110 episodes five seasons of stargate sg1 all of which have aired we have no further commitments from showtime with respect to these series following their initial exhibition cycle on showtime we exploit these programs further in other markets in this respect we entered into a license agreement with scifi channel for the exclusive domestic basic cable exhibition rights of the outer limits poltergeist the legacy and stargate sg1 additionally 22 new episodes of poltergeist were produced for usasci fi all of which have aired 22 new episodes of the outer limits were produced for usasci fi all of which have aired and 44 new episodes of stargate sg1 were produced for usasci fi of which 11 episodes have aired as of december 31 2002 22 episodes will be aired in 2003 and 11 episodes will be aired in 2004 

  

the programming agreement with showtime also includes a commitment by showtime to license eight madefortelevision movies from us none of which remain to be produced as of december 31 2002 one of these movies dirty pictures  won the golden globe award for “best miniseries or motion picture made for television” in 2001 giving showtime its first ever victory in that category in addition showtime has committed to licensing three new onehour series the first of which is jeremiah  a onehour action series which is currently in production twenty episodes of jeremiah have aired as of december 31 2002 showtime has renewed jeremiah for its second season of which 15 episodes will air in 2003 the second series will be dead like me  all 15 episodes of dead like me will be aired in 2003 the remaining series commitment remains to be produced 

  

in firstrun syndication we have launched a new series for the 20022003 broadcast season called she spies in an arrangement with nbc for station clearances on nbc owned and operated stations we are currently producing 20 episodes of the series of which seven episodes remain to be aired as of december 31 2002 

  

as the risks involved in the firstrun syndication business have increased significantly in recent years with the advent of mass vertical integration the resulting consolidation in the marketplace and the recent downturn in the economy and advertising market we are evaluating production of series for network television and continuing to focus on cable television although network television production typically requires greater deficit financing while offering the potential for greater financial return we intend to pursue joint ventures coproductions and other partnering arrangements for some of our future series in order to minimize our financial risk 

  

our rich film library provides us with a vast resource for developing television production and potential licensing opportunities much of our past success has resulted from transforming such library product into successful television franchises such as in the heat of the night stargate sg1 and the outer limits  currently we are developing the following projects among others legally blonde  a half hour series adaptation of our recent hit feature film for abc barbershop  a halfhour series adaptation of our recent hit feature film fame  a onehour series adaptation of our feature film for abc the thomas crown affairs  a onehour adaptation of our popular feature film for nbc and carrie  a onehour series for nbc based on our recently aired television movie in addition we are currently licensing the animated cartoon rights in the animated series stargate infinity  this enables us to share in the creative process while minimizing the financial risks stargate infinity will have a total of 26 episodes produced for fox kids on saturday mornings of which 13 episodes remain to be aired as of december 31 2002 

  

since our ability to recover production costs and realize profits on our television programs depends on various factors including but not limited to the programs’ acceptance by the public fluctuations in prevailing 

  

advertising rates and the ability to distribute the programs subsequent to their firstrun license there can be no assurance that we can recover the production costs or realize profits on any television series thus there is a substantial risk that some or all of our television projects will not be commercially successful resulting in costs not being recouped or anticipated profits not being realized see “—distribution” and “—competition” there is also financial exposure to us after the programming is licensed to the extent that advertising revenues andor license fees we receive are not sufficient to cover production costs moreover we may have certain financial obligations to the producer of a series if we cancel production prior to commencement of production for any broadcast season for which the series was licensed 

  

distribution 

  

theatrical distribution 

  

general the initial step in the release of a motion picture is the booking of engagements with theatrical exhibitors the exhibitors retain a portion of admissions paid at the box office which generally includes a fixed amount per week as well as a percentage of the gross receipts that escalates over time a studio’s or other producer’s or third party distributor’s share is generally approximately 50 percent of gross box office receipts although that percentage has generally decreased in recent years and varies depending upon factors such as market competition and the overall performance of the film 

  

we intend to release a slate of films appealing to a wide variety of audiences by strategically timing the release of our motion pictures throughout the year we seek to avoid some of the risks posed when a motion picture is inappropriately released during the most crowded and competitive box office seasons we believe that this strategy is unlikely to have a negative impact on our ability to generate home video rentals 

  

all motion pictures that we release theatrically in the us and canada whether produced by mgm pictures ua films or third parties are marketed and distributed by mgm distribution co 

  

in june 1999 we entered into an agreement with fox pursuant to which fox provides distribution services for our films in the international theatrical market this distribution services arrangement took effect on november 1 2000 although fox is servicing international theatrical distribution activities on our behalf we have reserved broad powers to direct and control the handling and release of our films we believe that this arrangement with fox reduces the amount of fixed overhead related to the distribution of our theatrical product in the international marketplace 

  

coproduction and distribution agreements in addition to producing motion pictures independently we enter into coproduction agreements split rights deals and similar arrangements under which we retain certain distribution rights with respect to a picture and share the cost of production with a partner that obtains other rights while such agreements limit our risk relating to a motion picture’s performance as they reduce our production costs such agreements also limit profitability we also acquire rights to distribute films through negative pickup arrangements under which we acquire a completed motion picture or certain rights therein from a third party under coproduction agreements split rights deals or negative pickup arrangements we may be committed to spend specified amounts for prints and advertising additionally we occasionally enter into “rentasystem” arrangements under which we provide distribution services to an independent film company for a percentage distribution fee under rentasystem arrangements the independent film company generally is responsible for all print and advertising costs these types of arrangements may be entered into before during or after production of a particular motion picture 

  

digital distribution on march 27 2002 a whollyowned subsidiary mgm digital development inc acquired a oneseventh interest in ndc llc a partnership created with the six other major studios to a develop andor ratify standards for digital motion picture equipment and for digital cinema technology to be used in the delivery of high quality intheatre digital cinema and b update and deploy a limited amount of new 

  

digital motion picture equipment in theatres we have contributed 10 million for our equity interest in the joint venture the agreement has an initial term expiring on march 27 2004 

  

theatrical marketing our theatrical marketing department consists of five functional groups research media planning advertising promotion and publicity the objective of the marketing department is to maximize each motion picture’s commercial potential by designing and implementing a marketing campaign tailored to appeal to the picture’s most receptive audience the marketing process begins with research before a motion picture is completed the research department determines through audience screenings and focus groups a motion picture’s appeal to its most likely target audience the marketing group begins to develop marketing materials well in advance of a motion picture’s scheduled theatrical release the marketing campaign generally begins six months before release with the circulation of teaser trailers posters and exhibitor advertising materials the campaign becomes more aggressive two to three months before release as fulllength trailers are released in theaters and additional materials are sent to exhibitors finally a national media campaign is launched four to five weeks before opening day this media campaign generally involves advertising a picture’s release on national television including network prime time and syndication markets national cable and radio and in magazines newspapers and specific target markets in addition public appearances such as television talk shows are arranged for a picture’s stars in order to promote the film the entire process is managed by our inhouse staff although outside agencies are frequently retained to provide certain creative services 

  

home video distribution 

  

our marketing and distribution strategy in the home video market domestically and internationally is to a market our motion picture and television titles in cohesive consumer and retailer promotions b create branded product lines c adapt to a maturing vhs market and a growing dvd market and d release new motion pictures into the home entertainment market at the time of the year that we believe will achieve the best results 

  

in addition to organizing our vhs and dvd product into branded collections we have launched an integrated sales and marketing branding initiative designed to create awareness for mgm catalog product and to drive store traffic to dedicated displays in key customer outlets under the “mgm means great movies” umbrella message the general advertising retailerspecific advertising and all instore signage for the mgm dedicated sections are combined to create awareness and demand for mgm catalog titles and to help consumers find them in stores 

  

additionally in connection with new films which we release into the market we often release related library films or groups of library films in order to increase sales of both the library films and new releases an example is the release of the james bond library titles in connection with the november 2002 theatrical release of die another day  we intend to continue this strategy of packaging groups of films or film franchises and releasing them in connection with the releases of our most highly visible new films furthermore we have released over 600 mgm dvd titles and now have a critical mass of properties in the marketplace from which we are able to create effective promotions that target the growing dvd consumer base 

  

mgm home entertainment manages the marketing and distribution of our current feature motion pictures and library product in the home video and other home entertainment markets 

  

in june 1999 we entered into an agreement with fox pursuant to which fox provides distribution services for our films in the international home video market this distribution arrangement became effective on february 1 2000 although fox is servicing international home video distribution activities on our behalf we have reserved broad powers to direct and control the handling of our home video product in 2003 we plan to expand our sales and marketing operations in western europe adding france and germany to operations already in place in the uk we also plan to add to our north american sales marketing and distribution operations with the addition of canada to our existing us distribution 

  

  

from 2001 to 2002 we increased our annual worldwide home video gross revenue from feature films from 5845 million to 7591 million we believe that this increase is in part a result of effective and efficient sales marketing and distribution of new release and library product and the growth of the dvd market 

  

in 2002 we continued to focus on developing strong retail relationships and programs that have increased our instore presence this presence has in turn increased our exposure to the endconsumer at retail and has had a positive impact on sales furthermore our retailers have recognized our successful sales and distribution effort in 2002 we were awarded the vendor of the year from hastings we were recognized as studio of the year by ingram and we won a key vendor service award from walmart for performance 

  

we have entered into revenue sharing agreements for our new releases and certain library titles pursuant to which we lease titles to rental establishments and receive a percentage of the consumer rental revenues generated from such titles although we can provide no assurance we believe that such arrangements may increase our revenues from the home video rental market by allowing us to participate in increased revenues from successful titles even though these revenues will be received over a longer period 

  

we intend to continue capitalizing on growing distribution formats such as dvd the dvd console installed base in the united states grew from over one million households at the beginning of 1999 to a base of approximately 400 million households by the end of 2002 we believe that this rapid growth combined with the strong desire among new dvd owners to create new film collections will continue to be a source of incremental revenue for us 

  

our dvd sales have increased from 3881 million in 2001 to 5795 million in 2002 an increase of approximately 49 percent the increase in dvd sales was partially offset by a drop in videocassette format sales resulting in an approximate 30 percent increase in worldwide home video sales we intend to continue expansion and exploitation of our dvd library product into 2003 

  

we also intend to capitalize on emerging distribution technologies such as videoondemand a technology that gives consumers the ability to order and control the playback of a feature film or other property as an example in 2001 we entered into a videoondemand joint venture now named movielink with four other major studios to distribute our properties in 2002 movielink launched a videoondemand service to deliver properties over the internet 

  

the development andor emergence of such distribution technologies platforms and formats however is dependent on the development and rollout of technology as well as other external factors and may create new risks to our ability to protect our intellectual property see “—competition” 

  

television distribution 

  

general we generally license our current theatrical motion pictures for pay television through output agreements pursuant to which films not yet produced are prelicensed for a specified fee paid on delivery we believe that output agreements with international distributors with recognized expertise are beneficial 

  

we intend to enter into relatively shortterm licenses of our library motion pictures for pay and free television with title selections designed for the relevant marketplace we have created a proprietary database for use by our sales force which contains detailed information on each of our films including dates of availability media controlled by us sales history genre format length stars soundtrack etc the sales force can utilize this information in order to fulfill customer demand for strategically designed offerings of motion pictures based on one or more criteria we believe that this system provides our sales force with an advantage in a competitive marketplace that requires large amounts of diverse content 

  

  

domestic pay television we have a theatrical motion picture output agreement with showtime requiring our future theatrical motion pictures to air on showtime’s pay television network we have extended the output term of the agreement with showtime to cover pictures theatrically released in the us commencing january 1 2000 and continuing until the earlier of december 31 2008 or the delivery of 270 pictures under the agreement the license fees for each picture are generally determined according to a formula based on us theatrical rentals of such picture 

  

in september 2001 we concluded a tenyear licensing agreement with starz encore group that includes over 1100 of our library films the deal generates a great deal of revenue and cash flow from the library titles and because the movies will shift in and out of starz encore windows we will also be able to sell them to other buyers throughout the course of the license term 

  

domestic free television we distribute our feature motion pictures to us and canadian networks local television stations and basic cable networks in the us and canada we also generate revenue by granting syndication licenses on a barter basis barter syndication allows the television stations to license our product in exchange for a portion of the local commercial airtime we in turn sell commercial airtime to advertisers on a national basis while the television stations retain a portion of the commercial airtime for local advertisers we have used outside barter companies to sell television spots to advertisers in the past but we commenced our own barter sales business in 1996 

  

in february 2002 we transitioned our barter sales operations to mgmnbc media sales llc a new media sales company formed by mgm domestic television distribution inc and nbc enterprises inc to distribute offnetwork feature film and television series and firstrun syndication programming from each company in the television barter sales markets the joint venture recognizes income from distribution fees earned on each company’s barter sales and incurs overhead costs to operate the joint venture which are shared between the companies each company is entitled to its share of the net profits or losses of mgmnbc media sales llc based on a contractual formula as specified in the agreement 

  

in connection with the acquisition of mgmua by pathe in november 1990 mgmpathe licensed the domestic free television rights to a substantial portion of its library the ua library and the post1986 mgmua titles in theatrical release at the time constituting approximately 850 titles and selected television programs to turner for a period of ten years beginning from the availability of each such product in that market the license excludes motion pictures released theatrically beginning in 1987 with respect to most of the motion pictures and television programming covered by the turner license the domestic free television rights revert to us between 2002 and 2005 we expect to receive relatively little revenue from the licensing of the product covered by the agreement with turner in the domestic free television market until such product reverts to us we believe that due to the significant increases in licensing fees for domestic television since 1990 the expiration of the turner license and our subsequent ability to freely license the library in this market together with our ability to utilize these titles on mgm branded cable and satellite channels will generate incremental revenue for us see “—film and television library” 

  

in june 2001 we entered into an agreement with the united paramount network upn to supply one film per week to the network which film is broadcast in its saturday daytime slot we sell the network advertising within the films in a revenue sharing arrangement with upn in april 2002 upn exercised its first option to renew the agreement for an additional year through september 5 2003 

  

in april 2002 mgm worldwide television distribution entered into an agreement with the viacom owned television networks the new tnn the national network cbs and upn for them to license from us the exclusive us television rights to 15 classic titles from the james bond franchise the agreement represents the first time that the three viacom networks the new tnn cbs and upn have acquired programming in one crossplatform agreement 

  

  

domestic cable television investment on april 2 2001 we entered into an agreement with cablevision systems corporation rainbow media holdings inc and four of rainbow’s subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the agreement we made an investment aggregating 8250 million in two general partnerships owned by rainbow as a result we acquired a 20 percent interest in each of these partnerships effective in april 2001 the partnerships own and operate the cable television channels american movie classics the independent film channel and we women’s entertainment formerly known as romance classics and until recently bravo in december 2002 we sold our 20 percent interest in bravo to a subsidiary of the national broadcasting company inc for 2500 million in cash see “—recent developments” in addition we have entered into licensing agreements with rainbow media licensing theatrical and television motion pictures to them 

  

network television in 2002 we launched she spies into syndication with nbc the show ran on the nbc network during the summer and in syndication in the fall it is currently cleared in over 98 percent of the us 

  

international pay and free television we currently distribute our motion pictures and television product through pay television licenses in over 90 territories we have output agreements with licensees in major territories including germany france the united kingdom italy japan latin america and brazil financial instability and increased concentration of buyers in foreign television markets including in european pay television markets may adversely affect our ability to renew output agreements on favorable terms in 2002 we received 650 million in revenue from international pay television distribution accounting for four percent of our total revenue for the year in october 2002 we entered into a new output agreement with premiere the leading paytelevision provider in germany and austria the new agreement replaces our prior agreement with kirchgruppe which filed for bankruptcy protection in germany the new agreement contains lower license fees but also provides for the launch of an mgmbranded channel in germany see “—branded cable and satellite channels” 

  

we currently distribute our motion pictures and television product through free television licenses in over 100 territories in 2002 we received 1752 million in revenues under these agreements accounting for 11 percent of our total revenues for the year these license arrangements typically provide licensees with the right to exhibit the licensed motion pictures on television for a specific number of airings over a period of three to seven years 

  

however subsequent to the acquisition of mgmua by pathe in november 1990 mgmpathe entered into longterm licenses of pay and free television rights for theatrical and television movies and in some cases television series in its library with united communications france and forta spain a similar agreement had been entered into in 1984 with degeto film germany substantially all of the license fees under these longterm licenses have already been paid to us and therefore we do not expect to receive significant revenue from these licenses in future periods with respect to most of the motion pictures licensed to united communications the rights granted currently revert to us through 2003 the james bond features were excluded from such license with respect to most of the motion pictures licensed to forta the vast majority of free television rights have reverted to us the distribution rights to the motion pictures and television series licensed under the original degeto agreement were scheduled to return to us incrementally through 2010 however effective january 2000 we amended the degeto agreement to reclaim nonexclusive pay television rights in germany to the approximately 425 titles subject to the license in exchange we agreed to extend degeto’s now nonexclusive license periods on a majority of the licensed titles by approximately 18 months beyond the original end dates for those titles this agreement with degeto now provides us with an opportunity to generate incremental revenue in germany’s pay television market see “—film and television library” 

  

additionally orion entered into certain longterm licenses covering a significant number of its library motion pictures in the international free and pay television markets orion had already received substantially all of the license fees under these licenses prior to our acquisition of orion and therefore we do not expect significant revenue from these licenses in future periods orion also licensed titles to capitol film and 

  

tv international germany compagnie luxembourgeoise de telediffusion france film finance group inc principal network limited italy mitsubishi corporation japan and televisio de catalunya sa spain the distribution rights granted to capitol film and tv international originally reverted to orion in 2025 in 2001 we negotiated the early return of 52 titles under license to capitol film  tv international for germanspeaking europe which gives us the opportunity to receive additional incremental license fees for the titles the majority of distribution rights granted to compagnie luxembourgeoise de telediffusion revert to orion between 2009 and 2013 the distribution rights granted to film finance group inc and principal network limited revert to orion through 2013 the distribution rights granted to televisio de catalunya sa currently are reverting to orion with such reversion being complete in 2010 we believe that due to the importance of france spain japan and italy and the significant increases in licensing fees for television in these markets since 1990 the expiration of these licenses and our subsequent ability to freely license our library in these markets could create substantial incremental revenue 

  

the mgmua and orion licenses discussed above in “—domestic free television” and “—international pay and free television” cover a crosssection of the motion pictures in our library although we exploit the remaining titles in the library in these markets they do not generate significant revenues 

  

in march 2001 we entered into an innovative multiyear alliance with nbc enterprises  syndication which was extended in january 2003 under which we will provide distribution services for certain nbc studios programming across all territories outside of north america we handle the sales and distribution of all of nbc studios’ current and future series and movies for television including the primetime series crossing jordan and will  grace and the new series boomtown american dreams  hidden hills and mr sterling  also included in the pact are a library component madefortelevision movies miniseries soap operas and specials

branded cable and satellite channels we believe that pursuing our strategy of providing strategically pooled branded mgm programming through the licensing of television channels to cable networks and television broadcasters as well as through the development of new channels of distribution that deliver our programming will provide opportunities in the international marketplace as foreign countries continue to develop cable and satellite television infrastructures we cannot assure you that we will have the financing that may be necessary for such acquisitions or investments that we will consummate such transactions or that we will be able to realize any anticipated benefits from any such transactions 

  

we own equity interests in channels reaching the following markets

trademarks and consumer products 

  

we own a portfolio of over 2200 trademark registrations around the world for such venerable trademarks as metrogoldwynmayer mgm the mgm lion logo united artists ua orion cannon and variations thereof we also own or control trademarks and characters associated with motion pictures and television series we produced andor distributed such as the pink panther and rocky in 2002 we realized over 392 million in revenue from the licensing of these trademarks and characters including interactive media products 

  

the mgm name and the mgm lion logo are among the most recognized trademarks in the world and have for over 75 years designated the source of the highest quality entertainmentrelated goods and services we believe these trademarks represent assets of which the value has been substantially unrealized in the past we plan to pursue a focused branded strategy that will capitalize on our name and logo and to seek licensing opportunities for such name and logo as well as our other trademarks in a wide range of product categories and distribution channels 

  

  

in february 1980 our predecessorininterest granted to a predecessorininterest of mgm mirage an exclusive openended royaltyfree license to use the trademark mgm as well as certain stylized lion depictions in its resort hotel andor gaming businesses and other businesses not related to filmed entertainment this license was amended in 1998 in june 2000 the license was further amended to allow mgm mirage to use the trademark mgm in combination with the trademark mirage to the same extent that it was permitted theretofore with regard to the mgm grand trademarks in consideration of this further grant of rights mgm mirage has agreed to pay an annual license fee of 10 million mgm mirage paid us 10 million in advance in june 2000 10 million in july 2001 and 10 million in july 2002 subsequent annual payments are due on each anniversary date thereafter

in july 2001 we entered into an agreement with mgm grand hotel llc for the licensing of the mgm lion logo on slot machines for one year with two oneyear options to renew this agreement terminated on december 31 2002 

  

competition 

  

motion picture production and distribution are highly competitive businesses we face competition from companies within the entertainment business as well as alternative forms of leisure entertainment we compete with the other major studios numerous independent motion picture and television production companies television networks and pay television systems for the acquisition of literary properties the services of performing artists directors producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing numerous organizations with which we compete in the motion picture industry have significantly greater financial and other resources than mgm while the independent production companies may have less overhead than mgm most of the other major studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations including television networks and cable channels which can provide both means of distributing their products and stable sources of earnings that offset the fluctuations in the financial performance of their motion picture and television operations see “—distribution—television distribution” 

  

in addition our motion pictures compete for audience acceptance and exhibition outlets with motion pictures produced and distributed by other companies as a result the success of any of our motion pictures is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular picture but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing motion pictures released into the marketplace at or near the same time the number of films released by our competitors particularly the other major film studios in any given period may create an oversupply of product in the market thereby potentially reducing our share of gross box office admissions and making it more difficult for our films to succeed 

  

competition is also intense within the television industry there are numerous suppliers of television programming including the networks the television production divisions of the major studios and independent producers all of which compete actively for the limited number of available broadcast hours our programming competes with firstrun programming network reruns and programs produced by local television stations competition is also intense in supplying motion pictures and other programming for the pay television and home video markets numerous organizations with which we compete in the television industry have significantly greater financial and other resources than mgm 

  

the entertainment industry in general and the motion picture and television industry in particular are continuing to undergo significant changes primarily due to technological developments for example as motion pictures begin to be distributed using emerging technologies such as the internet and online services the ability to protect intellectual property rights in motion pictures will be threatened by advances in technology that enable 

  

digital piracy this is because digital formats currently do not contain mechanisms for tracking the source or ownership of digital content as a result users may be able to download and distribute unauthorized or “pirated” copies of copyrighted motion pictures over the internet in addition there could be increased proliferation of devices capable of making unauthorized copies of motion pictures as long as pirated content is available to download digitally many consumers may choose to digitally download such pirated motion pictures rather than paying for legitimate motion pictures digital piracy of our films may adversely impact the gross receipts received from the exploitation of such films due to this rapid growth of technology and with it piracy as well as shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors will have on the potential revenue and profitability of featurelength motion pictures and television programming 

  

employees and labor matters 

  

as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 1150 fulltime and parttime regular employees in our worldwide operations of that total approximately 100 were primarily engaged in production and development approximately 450 were primarily engaged in sales marketing and distribution and approximately 600 were primarily engaged in management and administration approximately 200 of our employees are currently covered by employment contracts we also hire additional employees on a picturebypicture basis in connection with the production of our motion pictures and television programming the salaries of these additional employees as well as portions of the salaries of certain fulltime employees who provide direct production services are typically allocated to the capitalized cost of the related motion pictures or television programming we believe that our employee and labor relations are good 

  

approximately 20 of our current employees and many of the employees or independent contractors that we hire on a projectbyproject basis are represented under industrywide collective bargaining agreements with various unions including the writers guild of america the directors guild of america the screen actors guild and the international alliance of theatrical stage employees the motion picture and television programs produced by mgm studios and the other major us studios generally employ actors writers directors and technicians who are respectively members of the screen actors guild writers guild of america directors guild of america and the international alliance of theatrical stage employees pursuant to industrywide collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreement with writers guild of america was successfully renegotiated and became effective beginning may 2 2001 for a term of three years negotiations regarding the collective bargaining agreement with screen actors guild were successfully completed on july 3 2001 and the agreement was ratified effective as of july 1 2001 for a term of three years the directors guild of america collective bargaining agreement was successfully renegotiated and has been ratified with a term of three years from july 1 2002 negotiations with the international alliance of theatrical stage employees were successfully completed on november 16 2002 and ratification of a successor collective bargaining agreement with an effective date of august 1 2003 and a term of three years is expected many productions also employ members of a number of other unions including without limitation international brotherhood of electrical workers and the international brotherhood of teamsters a strike by one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of motion pictures or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities such a halt or delay depending on the length of time involved could cause delay or interruption in our release of new motion pictures and television programs and thereby could adversely affect our cash flow and revenues our revenues from motion pictures and television programs in our library should not be affected and may partially offset the effects of a strike to the extent if any that television exhibitors buy more library product to compensate for interruption in their firstrun programming 

  

regulation 

  

in 1994 the us was unable to reach agreement with its major international trading partners to include audiovisual works such as television programs and motion pictures under the terms of the world trade organization the failure to include audiovisual works under gatt allows many countries including members 

  

of the european union which currently consists of austria belgium denmark germany greece finland france ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal spain sweden and the united kingdom to continue enforcing quotas that restrict the amount of us produced television programming which may be aired on television in such countries the european union council of ministers has adopted a directive requiring all member states of the european union to enact laws specifying that broadcasters must reserve where practicable a majority of their transmission time exclusive of news sports game shows and advertising for european works the directive must be implemented by appropriate legislation in each member country under the directive member states remain free to require broadcasters under their jurisdiction to comply with stricter rules for example france requires that original french programming constitute a required portion of all programming aired on french television these quotas apply only to television programming several countries including france italy and korea also have quotas on the theatrical exhibition of motion pictures we cannot assure you that additional or more restrictive theatrical or television quotas will not be enacted or that countries with existing quotas will not more strictly enforce such quotas additional or more restrictive quotas or more stringent enforcement of existing quotas could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to exploit fully our motion pictures internationally 

  

distribution rights to motion pictures are granted legal protection under the copyright laws of the us and most foreign countries which laws provide substantial civil and criminal sanctions for unauthorized duplication and exhibition of motion pictures we seek to take appropriate and reasonable measures to secure protect and maintain or obtain agreements to secure protect and maintain copyright protection for all of our motion pictures or television programming under the laws of applicable jurisdictions motion picture piracy is an international as well as a domestic problem motion picture piracy is extensive in many parts of the world including south america asia including korea china and taiwan the countries of the former soviet union and other former eastern bloc countries in addition to the mpaa the motion picture association the american film marketing association and the american film export association monitor the progress and efforts made by various countries to limit or prevent piracy in the past these various trade associations have enacted voluntary embargoes of motion picture exports to certain countries in order to pressure the governments of those countries to become more aggressive in preventing motion picture piracy in addition the us government has publicly considered trade sanctions against specific countries which do not take steps to prevent copyright infringement of us produced motion pictures there can be no assurance that voluntary industry embargoes or us government trade sanctions will be enacted if enacted such actions could impact the amount of revenue that we realize from the international exploitation of our motion pictures depending upon the countries subject to such action and the duration and effectiveness of such action if not enacted or if other measures are not taken the motion picture industry including mgm may continue to lose an indeterminate amount of revenues as a result of motion picture piracy 

  

the code and ratings administration of the mpaa assigns ratings indicating agegroup recommendations for theatrical distribution of motion pictures we have followed and will continue to follow the practice of submitting our pictures for such ratings as a substantial number of our films are rated “r” under rules which are the theatrical exhibitors’ responsibility to enforce children under 17 may attend the applicable motion picture only if accompanied by an adult 

  

united states television stations and networks as well as foreign governments impose content restrictions on motion pictures that may restrict in whole or in part exhibition on television or in a particular territory there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not limit or alter our ability to exhibit certain motion pictures in such media or markets 

  

on december 8 2000 the federal court of canada in ottawa ontario issued an order directed to eighteen distributors purporting to include one of our subsidiaries and twentythree exhibitors requesting them to produce certain information relating to theatrical distribution and exhibition the court issued the order upon application of the commissioner of competition in connection with the commissioner’s civil investigation into allegations that certain exhibitors and distributors have entered into arrangements or have conducted the 

  

distribution and exhibition of motion pictures in an anticompetitive manner we complied with the order by letter dated december 13 2002 the competition bureau informed us of the commissioner’s intention to discontinue the inquiry without further action see “item 3 legal proceedings”

sources of revenue 

  

the principal sources of motion picture industry revenue are the domestic and international distribution of motion pictures including theatrical exhibition home entertainment and television payperview pay network syndication and basic cable over the last decade the relative contributions of these components of revenues have changed dramatically although revenues from domestic theatrical distribution have increased growth in total motion picture industry revenues has resulted predominantly from increased revenues derived from the distribution of motion pictures internationally as well as from other media and distribution channels 

  

our feature films are exploited through a series of sequential domestic and international distribution channels typically beginning with theatrical exhibition thereafter feature films are first made available for home video generally six months after theatrical release for pay television one year after theatrical release and for syndication approximately three to five years after theatrical release our television programming is produced for initial broadcast on either pay syndicated or network television in the united states followed by international territories and in some cases worldwide video markets 

  

we distribute our motion picture and television productions in foreign countries and in recent years have derived approximately 40 percent of our revenues from foreign sources approximately 25 percent of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies in addition we incur certain operating and production costs in foreign currencies as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows we in certain instances enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of our firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows these contracts generally mature within one year we do not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative purposes realized gains and losses on contracts that hedge anticipated future cash flows were not material in any of the periods presented herein we had no significant foreign currency exchange contracts relating to foreign currency denominated revenues outstanding at december 31 2002 see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

  

cost structure 

  

general in the motion picture industry the largest component of the cost of producing a motion picture generally is the negative cost which includes the “abovetheline” and “belowtheline” costs of producing the film abovetheline costs are costs related to the acquisition of picture rights and the costs associated with the producer the director the writer and the principal cast belowtheline costs are the remaining costs involved in producing the picture such as film studio rental principal photography sound and editing 

  

distribution expenses consist primarily of the costs of advertising and preparing release prints the costs of advertising associated with a major domestic theatrical motion picture release are significant and typically involve national and target market media campaigns as well as public appearances of a film’s stars these advertising costs are separate from the advertising costs associated with other domestic distribution channels and the international market 

  

the major studios generally fund production costs from cash flow generated by motion picture and related distribution activities or bank and other financing methods over the past decade expenses in the motion picture industry have increased rapidly as a result of increased production costs and distribution expenses see “item 1 business—the motion picture and television industry motion picture production” additionally each of the major studios must fund substantial overhead costs consisting primarily of salaries and related costs of the production distribution and administrative staffs as well as facilities costs and other recurring overhead 

  

collective bargaining agreements  the motion picture and television programs produced by mgm studios and the other major studios in the united states generally employ actors writers and directors who are members of the screen actors guild writers guild of america and directors guild of america pursuant to 

  

industrywide collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreement with writers guild of america was successfully renegotiated and became effective beginning may 2 2001 for a term of three years negotiations regarding the collective bargaining agreement with screen actors guild were successfully completed on july 3 2001 and the agreement was ratified effective as of july 1 2001 for a term of three years the directors guild of america collective bargaining agreement was successfully renegotiated and has been ratified with a term of three years from july 1 2002 many productions also employ members of a number of other unions including without limitation the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees and the teamsters negotiations with the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees were successfully completed on november 16 2002 and ratification of a successor collective bargaining agreement with an effective date of august 1 2003 and a term of three years is expected a strike by one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of motion pictures or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities such a halt or delay depending on the length of time involved could cause delay or interruption in our release of new motion pictures and television programs and thereby could adversely affect our cash flow and revenues our revenues from motion pictures and television programs in our library should not be affected and may partially offset the effects of a strike to the extent if any that television exhibitors buy more library product to compensate for interruption in their firstrun programming 

  

accounting for motion picture and television costs  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and industry practice see “—industry accounting practices” we amortize the costs of production including capitalized interest and overhead as well as participations and talent residuals for feature films and television programming using the individualfilmforecast method under which such costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that revenue earned in the current period for such title bears to management’s estimate of the total revenues to be realized from all media and markets for such title effective january 1 2001 all exploitation costs including advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred theatrical print costs are amortized over the periods of theatrical release of the respective territories 

  

management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its total revenue estimates on a titlebytitle basis which may result in a change in the rate of amortization andor a writedown of the film or television asset to estimated fair value these revisions can result in significant quartertoquarter and yeartoyear fluctuations in film writedowns and amortization a typical film or television program recognizes a substantial portion of its ultimate revenues within the first two years of release by then a film has been exploited in the domestic and international theatrical markets and the domestic and international home video markets as well as the domestic and international pay television and payperview markets and a television program has been exploited on network television or in firstrun syndication a similar portion of the film’s or television program’s capitalized costs should be expected to be amortized accordingly assuming the film or television program is profitable 

  

the commercial potential of individual motion pictures and television programming varies dramatically and is not directly correlated with production or acquisition costs therefore it is difficult to predict or project a trend of our income or loss however the likelihood that we report losses particularly in the year of a motion picture’s release is increased by the industry’s method of accounting which requires the immediate recognition of the entire loss through increased amortization in instances where it is estimated the ultimate revenues of a motion picture or television program will not recover our capitalized costs on the other hand the profit of a profitable motion picture or television program must be deferred and recognized over the entire revenue stream generated by that motion picture or television program this method of accounting may also result in significant fluctuations in reported income or loss particularly on a quarterly basis depending on our release schedule the timing of advertising campaigns and the relative performance of individual motion pictures or television programs 

  

equity investments  we are accounting for our remaining investment in the cable channels in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” in accordance with apb opinion no 18 management continually reviews its equity investments to determine if any impairment has occurred if in management’s judgment an investment has 

  

sustained an otherthantemporary decline in its value the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings such determination is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances including the financial condition of the investee subscriber demand and growth demand for advertising time and space the intent and ability to retain the investment and general economic conditions in the areas in which the investee operates as of december 31 2002 management has determined that there have been no impairments for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 1 to consolidated financial statements 

  

industry accounting practices  beginning january 1 2001 we adopted new accounting rules see “ — new accounti ng pron ouncements ” below which require among other changes that exploitation costs including advertising and marketing costs be expensed as incurred theatrical print costs are amortized over the periods of theatrical release of the respective territories under accounting rules in effect for periods prior to january 1 2001 such costs were capitalized as a part of film costs and amortized over the life of the film using the individualfilmforecast method the current practice dramatically increases the likelihood of reporting losses upon a film’s theatrical release but will provide for increased returns when a film is released in the ancillary markets of home video and television when we incur a much lower proportion of advertising costs additional provisions under the new accounting rules include changes in revenue recognition and accounting for development costs and overhead and reduced amortization periods for film costs 

  

new accounting pronouncements  in june 2000 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 139 “rescission of fasb no 53 and amendments to fasb statements no 63 89 and 121” which effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2000 rescinds statement of financial accounting standards no 53 “financial reporting by producers and distributors of motion picture films” the companies that were previously subject to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 53 are following the guidance in american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 002 “accounting by producers or distributors of films” issued in june 2000 statement of position 002 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for all producers and distributors that own or hold the rights to distribute or exploit films statement of position 002 provides that the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles caused by its adoption should be included in the determination of net income in conformity with accounting principles board opinion no 20 “accounting changes” we adopted the statement of position on january 1 2001 and recorded a onetime noncash cumulative effect charge to earnings of 3823 million primarily to reduce the carrying value of our film and television costs the new rules also require that advertising costs be expensed as incurred as opposed to the old rules which generally allowed advertising costs to be capitalized as part of film costs and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method due to the significant advertising costs incurred in the early stages of a film’s release we anticipate that the new rules will significantly impact our results of operations for the foreseeable future 

  

in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 137 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of financial accounting standards board no 133” and by statement of financial accounting standards no 138 “accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of financial accounting standards board statement no 133” which is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000 this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 133 beginning january 1 2001 and recorded a onetime noncash cumulative effect adjustment in stockholders’ equity and other comprehensive income of 05 million the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 133 did not materially impact our results of operations

in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets this statement supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations—reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion this statement also amends accounting research board no 51 “consolidated financial statements” to eliminate the exception to consolidation for subsidiaries for which control is likely to be temporary we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 144 beginning january 1 2002 the impact of such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

in june 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” this statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan statement of financial accounting standards no 146 nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” and will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 we will implement statement of financial accounting standards no 146 on january 1 2003 the impact of such adoption is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

in december 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure—an amendment of statement of financial accounting standard no 123” this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standard no 123

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our reported operating results for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 due to the adoption of the new accounting rules on january 1 2001 see “—new accounting pronouncements” above the operating results in 2002 and 2001 are not comparable to the operating results in 2000 

  

   

as discussed above on january 1 2001 we adopted statement of position 002 which established new accounting and reporting standards for all producers and distributors that own or hold the rights to distribute or exploit films see “ — industry accounting practices ” as a result of the adoption of the new accounting rules as of january 1 2001 we recorded a onetime noncash cumulative effect charge to the consolidated statement of operations of 3823 million primarily to reduce the carrying value of our film and television inventory 

  

  

unconsolidated companies include our investment in the rainbow media group cable channels and our investment in an ondemand movie service joint venture see “—recent developments” above as well as various interests in international cable channels the majority of which are accounted for under the equity method consolidated and unconsolidated companies’ revenues operating income loss and ebitda are as follows 

  

   

while management considers ebitda to be an important measure of comparative operating performance it should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute for or superior to operating income net earnings cash flow and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ebitda does not reflect cash available to fund cash requirements and the items excluded from ebitda such as depreciation and nonfilm amortization are significant components in assessing our financial performance other significant uses of cash flows are required before cash will be available to us including debt service taxes and cash expenditures for various longterm assets our calculation of ebitda may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited for purposes of our calculation unconsolidated ebitda includes unconsolidated operating income loss and the addback of depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets of 147 million 192 million and 06 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

revenues feature film revenues increased by 1990 million or 16 percent to 14169 million in the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 

  

worldwide theatrical revenues increased by 293 million or 13 percent to 2613 million in 2002 in 2002 we benefited from the successful performances of die another day  barbershop and crocodile hunter  as well as the limited releases of bowling for columbine nicholas nickleby evelyn and igby goes down  among others earlier in the year we also released rollerball hart’s war deuce’s wild and windtalkers which were

year ended december 31 2001 compared to year ended december 31 2000 

  

revenues feature film revenues increased by 1597 million or 15 percent to 12180 million in the year ended december 31 2001 compared to the year ended december 31 2000 

  

worldwide theatrical revenues increased by 890 million or 62 percent to 2320 million in 2001 principally due to the successful releases of hannibal legally blonde heartbreakers jeepers creepers and bandits  in 2000 significant worldwide theatrical revenues were generated by the world is not enough which 

  

was initially released in november 1999 and by the domestic theatrical releases of return to me and autumn in new york  overall in 2001 we released 11 new feature films domestically and eight new films internationally in 2000 we released eight new feature films domestically and five new films internationally

worldwide pay television revenues from feature films increased by 107 million or seven percent to 1715 million in 2001 principally due to the delivery of six new films autumn in new york  return to me  antitrust  three strikes  supernova and things you can tell just by looking at her  as well as a significant new license of library product to domestic pay television correspondingly in 2000 we delivered the world is not enough  the thomas crown affair  stigmata  the mod squad the rage carrie 2 and tea with mussolini among others to domestic pay television network television revenues decreased by 416 million or 95 percent to 23 million in 2001 principally due to the lack of new films delivered to network television as compared to the delivery in 2000 of tomorrow never dies as well as a new licensing arrangement for the james bond movie series worldwide syndicated television revenues from feature films increased by 554 million or 35 percent to 2127 million in 2001 principally due to the licensing of ronin at first sight species 2 the mod squad and the rage carrie 2 in domestic markets and sales in international markets for the world is not enough tomorrow never dies ronin and the man in the iron mask among others 

  

other feature film revenues decreased by 02 million or one percent to 150 million in 2001 

  

operating results operating income and ebitda from feature films decreased by 986 million or 49 percent to 1018 in 2001 the decrease in operating income and ebitda from feature films reflected the implementation of the new accounting rules upon the adoption of statement of position 002 on january 1 2001 which resulted in 1059 million of additional theatrical advertising and print costs expensed in 2001 as well as the disappointing performances of what’s the worst that could happen bandits and josie and the pussycats  partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in earnings were significant operating profits generated from the successful theatrical and home video releases of hannibal and legally blonde the rerelease on home video of silence of the lambs the successful domestic theatrical release of jeepers creepers and increased film library sales from various home video promotions as well as lower third party distribution expenses 

  

operating results for feature films were also positively impacted in 2001 due to the significant increase in dvd sales and new television licensing agreements the growth in the dvd and television markets had a favorable impact on our film amortization rates in 2001 which was partially offset by advertising costs incurred for unreleased film product at december 31 2001 which are required to be expensed under the new accounting rules the aggregate effect of these items resulted in a net favorable impact on our operating income in 2001 of approximately 91 million 

  

operating results in 2000 benefited from prior accounting rules in which theatrical advertising and print costs were capitalized and amortized under the income forecast method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 53 operating results in 2000 also included profits earned from the worldwide theatrical receipts generated by the world is not enough and the home video release of the world is not enough the thomas crown affair and stigmata

anticipated needs our current strategy and business plan call for substantial ongoing investments in the production of new feature films and television programs furthermore we may wish to continue to make investments in new distribution channels to further exploit our motion picture and television library we plan to continue to evaluate the level of such investments in the context of the capital available to us and changing market conditions currently we would require additional sources of financing if we decided to make any additional significant investments in new distribution channels 

  

we believe that the amounts available under the revolving facility and cash flow from operations will be adequate for us to conduct our operations in accordance with our business plan for at least the next 12 months this belief is based in part on the assumption that our future releases will perform as planned any significant decline in the performance of our films could adversely impact our cash flows and require us to obtain additional sources of funds in addition to the foregoing sources of liquidity we are currently considering various film financing alternatives 

  

if necessary in order to manage our cash needs we may also delay or alter production or release schedules or seek to reduce our aggregate investment in new film and television production costs there can be no assurance that any such steps would be adequate or timely or that acceptable arrangements could be reached with third parties if necessary in addition although these steps would improve our shortterm cash flow and in the case of partnering reduce our exposure should a motion picture perform below expectations such steps could adversely affect longterm cash flow and results of operations in subsequent periods 

  

we intend to continue to consider either growing into or becoming part of a larger vertically integrated organization in connection with our pursuit of these options we may consider various strategic alternatives such as business combinations with companies with strengths complementary to those of ours other acquisitions and joint ventures as opportunities arise the nature size and structure of any such transaction could require us to seek additional financing
