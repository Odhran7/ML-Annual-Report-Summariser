competition 

we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are as follows 

• superior research content  we believe that we create the broadest highestquality and most relevant research coverage across all major functional roles in an enterprise our independent operating model and research analysis generates 

unbiased insight that we believe is timely thoughtprovoking and comprehensive and that is known for its high quality independence and objectivity 

• our leading brand name  we have provided critical trusted insight under the gartner name for more than 40 years 

• our global footprint and established customer base  we have a global presence with clients in approximately 100 countries and territories on six continents a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the united states 

• insight that creates connections  our global community of experts analysts and peers help provide the deep relationships that help clients stay ahead of the curve 

• experienced management team  our management team is comprised of research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at gartner 

• substantial operating leverage in our business model  we can distribute our intellectual property and expertise across multiple platforms including research and advisory subscription and membership programs conferences and consulting engagements to derive incremental revenue and profitability 

• vast network of research experts and consultants  as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 2200 research experts and 760 experienced consultants located around the world our research experts are located in more than 30 countries and territories enabling us to cover vast aspects of business and technology on a global basis 

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly with consulting firms and other data and information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services while we believe the breadth and depth of our research positions us well versus our competition increased competition could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures 

intellectual property 

our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies software reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights we have policies related to confidentiality ownership and the use and protection of gartner’s intellectual property we also enter into agreements with our employees and third parties as appropriate that protect our intellectual property and we enforce these agreements if necessary we recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify create and protect it additionally we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by our end users 

human capital management 

we believe our people are our most valuable asset enabling our long track record of global growth from attracting diverse talent through our recruitment process to cultivating that talent with learning and development opportunities and rewards for strong performers to supporting overall wellness with meaningful benefits and engagement we strive to put our people first at december 31 2021 we had approximately 16600 employees globally and the overwhelming majority of our employees were full time 

gartner is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all applicants and employees without regard to any legally protected status this commitment is formalized in our global and us equal employment opportunity policies we continually renew this commitment by seeking to optimize our recruitment and professional development processes create networking and educational opportunities celebrate heritage and history encourage community service and outreach and create safe spaces for all employees our human capital management strategies are developed by executive management and overseen by the compensation committee of our board of directors 

diversity equity and inclusion 

we foster an environment of professional development to help our employees reach their full potential through a culture of continuous improvement this includes embracing diversity and actively removing barriers to support inclusion engagement and growth at gartner our diversity equity and inclusion “dei” executive council composed of our ceo chief human resources officer cfo general counsel head of diversity equity and inclusion and other selected leaders drives diversity equity and inclusion as an imperative at all levels of the organization in addition the dei center of excellence which reports directly to our chief human resources officer codifies our strategy and establishes goals against key metrics to drive greater transparency and accountability our teams of employees are composed of individuals from different geographies cultures religions ethnicities races genders sexual orientations abilities and generations working together to solve problems as of december 31 2021 approximately 46 of our employees worldwide and 36 of our board of directors identified as female in addition 18 of our board of directors and approximately 22 of employees in the us identified as racially or ethnically diverse on a worldwide basis our employees were represented by more than 85 selfidentified nationalities working in 38 different countries and territories 

we focus on the role of unconscious bias and endeavor to build tools that help make various business processes more inclusive and accommodate a more diverse perspective we emphasize the importance of inclusion to leaders and managers and the value of fostering a sense of belonging within their teams we also continue to invest in learning opportunities to develop dei at gartner for example our popular embracing diversity  being inclusive module has enrolled more than 5600 associates since its inception 

the company supports a number of employeedriven employee resource groups “ergs” that bring employees together to foster a diverse inclusive and supportive workplace gartner currently has six formal ergs supporting underrepresented racial ethnic and multicultural backgrounds women the lgbtq community veterans and employees with disabilities participation in ergs is voluntary and open to all employees in 2021 over 4300 gartner associates were members of at least one erg 

health safety and compensation 

we seek to invest in meaningful innovative and inclusive compensation and benefit programs that support physical financial and emotional wellbeing of our employees in addition to salaries these programs which vary by countryregion include annual bonuses stock awards an employee stock purchase plan 401k matching healthcare and insurance benefits tax savings programs such as health and dependent care flexible spending accounts health savings account and pretax commuter benefits generous paid time off paid parental leave life and disability insurance business travel accident insurance charity matching employee assistance programs tuition assistance and onsite services such as health centers and fitness centers among others we believe that our equity grants facilitate retention as well as encourage performance of key personnel 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we implemented significant changes to protect the health and safety of our employees clients and the communities in which we operate this included the temporary closure of our offices in the united states united kingdom india and several other impacted locations around the world as well as the cancellation of certain inperson conferences we have now reopened a majority of our offices including our corporate headquarters and are planning to reopen the remaining offices in early 2022 with safety guidelines to protect employee health in 2021 we announced a hybrid virtualfirst working arrangement which provides additional flexibility to employees enabling most of them to continue working remotely a substantial portion of the time we also provide a number of free mental and behavioral health resources including access to the employee assistance program for employees and their dependents 

talent development retention and training 

gartner aims to foster a culture of lifelong learning getting feedback and evolving in addition to helping employees unlock their full potential through mechanisms like continuous feedback and performance appraisals we have dedicated programs designed to develop effective leaders we also offer rotational programs and an online learning experience platform for employees called gartneryou in 2021 gartneryou offered close to 45000 learning resources with more than 321000 completions globally since our sales and research  advisory teams make up of approximately 50 of total employees worldwide we also have formal dedicated programs to help train and onboard new hires as well as more experienced managers and leaders within sales and research  advisory in 2021 gartner transformed how we onboard new sales hires so they more quickly develop the core competencies tied to sales success rooted in learning and development best practices the reimagined program operates in a scalable model that provides new sales hires in their first year with access to as many as 500 wellpaced justintime learning assets more than 1200 sales associates went through this program in 2021 through these programs we believe our teams develop rolespecific knowledge and skills increase productivity and improve performance 

we also strive to develop an inclusive and engaging environment that makes gartner a vibrant exciting place to work we believe the greatest catalyst to engagement comes from leadership — particularly their efforts to set direction allocate 

resources and build individual and organizational capability we embed our associate survey efforts within our business units so that the insight we glean can help leaders understand the opportunities for effecting organizational growth businessunitspecific survey results are used for a number of leaderspecific interventions from individualized coaching to teambased skillbuilding to businessunitwide initiatives targeting key areas of engagement although like many companies we experienced an uptick in associate turnover in 2021 the average employee tenure decreased only slightly from 52 years in 2020 to 51 years in 2021 moreover average employee tenure increased year over year for our sales team 

our communities 

our associates have a long history of individual and team volunteering in addition to providing the flexibility for associates to spend time volunteering we facilitate and support on and offsite volunteer projects for teams and encourage nonprofit board

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions and trends the following sections address significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky we urge you to consider carefully the factors described below and the risks that they present for our operations as well as the risks addressed in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k when the factors events and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this form 10k materialize there could be a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and therefore have a potential negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment in addition to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in item 7 of this form 10k and in the risk factors below additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below risks in this section are grouped in the 

following categories 1 risks related to the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 2 strategic and operational risks 3 macroeconomic and industry risks 4 legal and regulatory risks and 5 risks related to our common stock many risks affect more than one category and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories 

risks related to the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance specifically our conferences segment as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of our customers and the duration and extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to affect our operations financial performance results of operations achievement of strategic objectives andor stock price remains uncertain the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our operations financial performance and demand for our products and services it has also adversely affected the operations and financial performance of many of our clients additionally the covid19 pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in a substantial curtailment of business activities including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of products and services both regionally and globally weakened economic conditions significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets finally new variants of covid19 continue to emerge including the delta variant and more recently the omicron variant which has caused and may continue to cause significant uncertainty the future impact of the delta and omicron variants or other variants that may emerge cannot be predicted at this time and may be affected by numerous factors including vaccination rates and availability in the us and globally the effectiveness of current vaccines against the variants and responses by various governments such as lockdowns and other restrictive measures 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected our operations and financial performance to a number of risks that may have or may continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition including but not limited to those discussed below 

• we have had to temporarily close gartner offices including our corporate headquarters in the united states united kingdom india and several other impacted locations around the world and implemented significant travel restrictions though many of our employees continue to work remotely these changes impact the normal operation of our business although we have reopened most offices and have plans to reopen substantially all remaining offices in early 2022 health and safety permitting reopening is subject to many factors outside of our control as a result we cannot predict for certain when or how we will begin to lift the actions put in place as part of our business continuity plans including work from home protocols and travel restrictions 

• we cancelled inperson conferences scheduled for 2020 beginning in late februaryearly march 2020 with the remainder being cancelled after the world health organization’s declaration of the covid19 pandemic later in march 2020 we began holding virtual conferences during the second half of 2020 we held 39 virtual conferences during 2021 and expect to continue to deliver conferences virtually during 2022 these virtual conferences have resulted in significantly less revenue and gross contribution than inperson conferences but we believe they aid in client retention and engagement future inperson conferences will be held only if we determine the relevant impacts of covid19 have sufficiently receded in the jurisdictions where our conferences are to be held additionally our conferences business strategy may evolve over time for additional information about how covid19 affects our conferences business see the risk factor titled “ the profitability and success of our conferences and other meetings are subject to external factors beyond our control ” 

• our management is focused on mitigating the effects of covid19 on our business which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and may delay other valueadded services 

additionally we face challenges from evolving factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control remain uncertain and to which we may not effectively respond for example our operations span numerous locations around the world and many local governments and countries have imposed or may impose various restrictions on our employees partners and customers’ physical movement to limit the spread of covid19 these restrictions are constantly changing and we cannot predict how long and to what extent they will continue we also face increased operational hurdles as we make efforts to promote employee health and safety including limiting travel limiting access to offices and implementing a hybrid virtualfirst work policy meaning that most of our employees will have the option to work remotely at least some of the time for the foreseeable future in addition complying with various customer or government vaccine masking andor testing requirements may result in increased competition for skilled talent adversely impact our ability to deliver services to our customers and adversely impact our operational results or financial performance 

moreover covid19 may adversely impact our subscriptionbased business model which accounts for a significant portion of our revenue by causing clients to decrease new and renewals of subscriptionbased services and to request to cancel or renegotiate current subscriptionbased services the effect of covid19 on our subscriptionbased model may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods 

further the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and financial performance depend on future developments that cannot currently be accurately predicted such as 

• the severity and transmission rate of the virus and variants 

• the extent and effectiveness of containment actions 

• the timing of the development and distribution of effective vaccines globally andor treatments and their acceptance by the general public 

• the health and wellbeing of our workforce 

• the extent and duration of the effect on client spending and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and vendors 

• the impact on our liquidity 

• increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets 

• the effect of the pandemic on the creditworthiness of our customers 

• global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and 

• the pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides 

the occurrence or continuation of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial performance 

the impact of covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k any of which could have a material effect on us this situation is changing rapidly and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted 

strategic and operational risks 

we may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends on our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information and advice that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our published data opinions or viewpoints prove to be wrong lack independence or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation will suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could materially adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our clients develop enhance and improve our existing products as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

technology is rapidly evolving and if we do not continue to develop new product and service offerings in response to these changes our business could suffer disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the environment in which we our clients and 

our competitors operate we will need to continue to respond to these changes by enhancing our product and service offerings to maintain our competitive position however we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhancing our products on a timely basis and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our clients our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new or enhanced existing offerings that address the changing needs of this constantly evolving marketplace failure to develop products that meet the needs of our clients in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition some of our content is exposed to internet search engines which help generate website traffic search engines often update their proprietary algorithms which could affect the placement of links to our websites some search engines also provide substantive content in search results which if expanded to the areas in which we operate could reduce the need to enter our websites if a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects our placement in search results or makes it less likely for our target audience to enter our websites our business results of operations and financial condition would be harmed 

our research business depends on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services will lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted approximately 79 and 81 of total revenues from our ongoing operations for 2021 and 2020 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often timeconsuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription contracts are typically for twelve months or longer our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

• delivering highquality and timely analysis and advice to our clients 

• understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients and 

• providing products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition 

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 86 and 83 at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

the profitability and success of our conferences and other meetings are subject to external factors beyond our control our conferences business constituted approximately 5 and 3 of total revenues from our ongoing operations in 2021 and 2020 respectively as a result of the covid19 pandemic we cancelled inperson conferences scheduled for 2020 beginning in late februaryearly march 2020 with the remainder being cancelled after the world health organization’s declaration of the covid19 pandemic later in march 2020 we began holding virtual conferences during the second half of 2020 we held 39 virtual conferences during 2021 and expect to continue to deliver conferences virtually during 2022 these virtual conferences are expected to result in significantly less revenue and gross contribution but we believe aid in client retention and engagement 

we expect our conferences revenues will continue to be negatively impacted until inperson conferences can be held moreover our clients that typically attend these conferences may have pandemicrelated travel restrictions in place that could affect attendance once these conferences resume at this time we also cannot predict the extent to which local governments may restrict inperson gatherings and what additional measures will be required to hold inperson conferences safely such as providing masks social distancing and increased sanitation these safety requirements would likely cause us to incur additional costs and may limit the number of participants at our inperson conferences in addition perceived or actual spread of coronavirus at one of our conferences could cause reputational damage the safety of our associates and clients remains our top priority so future inperson conferences will be held only if we determine the relevant impacts of covid19 have sufficiently receded in the jurisdictions where our conferences are to be held 

we also face risks related to insurance coverage for our cancelled conferences our event cancellation insurance provides up to 170 million in coverage for 2020 with the right to reinstate that amount one time if those limits are utilized the insurer has contested our right to reinstate limits and to include in reinstated limits conferences cancelled due to covid19 gartner also has event cancellation insurance for 2021 covering events that were planned for 2021 but cancelled of up to 150 million with 

the right to reinstate up to that amount one time if the initial limits are inadequate the insurer has contested all coverage for events cancelled in 2021 due to covid19 we are in litigation with the insurer on these issues in 2021 we received 1669 million of proceeds related to 2020 insurance claims and recorded a gain of 1523 million our insurance coverage for 2022 and likely beyond however excludes cancellation due to communicable diseases our event cancellation insurer is seeking additional information for cancelled evanta meetings to determine whether gartner may be entitled to an additional 31 million in coverage for evanta meetings cancelled in 2020 gartner is seeking to reinstate and recover up to an additional 20 million for cancelled 2020 evanta meetings and to reinstate and recover up to an additional 150 million in losses from cancelled 2020 destination conferences gartner is also seeking 150 million in initial limits for events cancelled in 2021 and to reinstate those limits up to an additional 150 million it is unclear when we will receive the proceeds from our insurance claims related to the conferences cancelled which could affect our financial results 

the market for desirable dates and locations for our activities has historically been highly competitive once we decide to resume inperson conferences if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences the profitability for these conferences will suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our conferences are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these activities can be affected by circumstances outside of our control in addition to the covid19 pandemic such as the occurrence of or concerns related to labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks war weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the conference or meeting we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major activities 

our consulting business depends on nonrecurring engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted approximately 9 of total revenues from our ongoing operations in both 2021 and 2020 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring in addition revenue from our contract optimization business can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not predictable our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

• delivering consistent highquality consulting services to our clients 

• tailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients and 

• our ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagements 

a material decline in our ability to replace consulting engagements will have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services and our future growth plans our success is based on attracting and retaining talented employees and we depend heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive maintaining our brand and reputation is important to our ability to recruit and retain employees we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals we face risks related to global labor shortages and competitive markets have increased attrition throughout our sector moreover vaccine mandates may result in increased employee attrition if implemented additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that enables our employees to thrive we may also be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws and changes to policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent could inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development and other efforts 

an inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel could materially adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as our future business and operating results or stock price in addition effective succession planning is important to our longterm success and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

additionally as a result of the covid19 pandemic the vast majority of our employees transitioned to working from home in early 2022 we began to operate under a hybrid virtualfirst working environment meaning that most of our employees have the option to work remotely at least some of the time for the foreseeable future the hybrid working environment may impair our ability to maintain our culture of collaboration and continuous improvement and may cause disruptions among our employees including lost productivity communication challenges and potentially employee dissatisfaction and attrition if our attempts to safely reopen our offices and operate under a hybrid working environment are not successful our business could be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states conducting business in certain foreign jurisdictions may require accepting compromised protections or yielding of rights to technology data or intellectual property rights in order to access those markets accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized or undesired thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

our employees are subject to restrictive covenant agreements which include restrictions on employees’ ability to compete and solicit customers and employees and assignment of invention agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the period expires relating to their particular restrictions former employees may compete against us if a former employee violates the provisions of the restrictive covenant agreement we seek to enforce the restrictions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our conferences concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to damage our reputation and deter current and prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our conferences in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including conference attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects while we believe our overall data privacy procedures are adequate the theft or loss of such data or concerns about our practices even if unfounded with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data protection related matters could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our operating results any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users’ personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our conferences as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to our business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in our computer systems and networks and in those of our thirdparty vendors individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers the cybersecurity risks we face range from cyber attacks common to most industries such as the development and deployment of malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions to more advanced threats that target us because of our prominence in the global research and advisory field 

like many multinational corporations we and some third parties upon which we rely have experienced cyber attacks on our computer systems and networks in the past and may experience them in the future likely with more frequency and sophistication and involving a broader range of devices and modes of attack all of which will increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business operations products services or customers we have implemented various security controls to both meet our security obligations while also defending against constantly evolving security threats our security controls help to secure our information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers are vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyber attacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events as a result of the covid19 pandemic most of our employees are working remotely which magnifies the 

importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures additionally the security compliance landscape continues to evolve requiring us to stay apprised of changes in cybersecurity laws regulations and security requirements required by our clients such as the european union general data protection regulation gdpr the california consumer privacy act ccpa the brazilian general data protection law lgpd the chinese cybersecurity data security and personal information protection laws and other new and proposed data protection laws international organization for standardization iso and national institute of standards and technology nist recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber attacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers 

a cyber attack widespread internet failure or internet access limitations or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions additionally any material breaches of cybersecurity or other technologyrelated catastrophe or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard our customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 

any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have invested substantial amounts and expect to continue investing as necessary in access to data centers and equipment and in moving more of our workload into cloud services upgrading our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and delivering our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company increase revenue or fully realize anticipated synergies the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

we face risks related to leased office space we assumed a significant amount of leased office space in particular in arlington virginia in connection with the acquisition of ceb inc in 2017 in arlington we have consolidated all our businesses into a single building and have sublet substantially all of the excess space in our other properties through our real estate consolidations and other related activities we have tried to secure quality subtenants with appropriate sublease terms however if subtenants default on their sublease obligations with us or otherwise terminate their subleases with us we may experience a loss of planned sublease rental income which could result in a material charge against our operating results additionally the longterm impact of covid19 on leased office space availability and rental costs of leased office space is not yet known 

to accommodate our growth going forward we have moved to a global hoteling option to better manage our footprint and operating expenses and will secure new space when the opportunities and need arise if the new spaces are not completed on schedule or if the landlord defaults on its commitments and obligations pursuant to the new leases we may incur additional expenses in addition unanticipated difficulties in initiating operations in a new space including construction delays it system interruptions or other infrastructure support problems could result in a delay in moving into the new space resulting in a loss of employee and operational productivity and a loss of revenue andor additional expenses which could also have an adverse material impact on our operating results 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and some may be terminated early we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the united states government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2021 and 2020 approximately 790 million and 689 million respectively of our outstanding revenue contracts were attributable to government entities our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms certain of these contracts may be terminated at any time by the government entity without cause or penalty “termination for convenience” in addition contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures and compliance requirements as well as intense competition failure to adequately abide by these procedures and compliance requirements could result in an inability to contract with governments or their agencies termination of existing contracts or even suspension and disbarment from doing future business with a government or agency moreover while terminations by governments for lack of funding have not been significant historically should appropriations for the various governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of revenues 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our “gartner” brand in particular our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and top talent and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may also discover that our brand though recognized is not perceived to be relevant by new market segments we have targeted we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote maintain and protect the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 

our outstanding debt obligations could negatively impact our financial condition and future operating results as of december 31 2021 the company had outstanding debt of 288 million under its 2020 term loan and revolving credit facility the “2020 credit agreement” 800 million of senior notes due 2028 the “2028 notes” 600 million of senior notes due 2029 the “2029 notes” and 800 million of senior notes due 2030 the “2030 notes” additional information regarding the 2020 credit agreement the 2028 notes the 2029 notes and the 2030 notes is included in note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the debt service requirements of these borrowings could impair our future financial condition and operating results in addition the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2020 credit agreement as well as the covenants related to the senior notes could limit our future financial flexibility a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding which could materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders and noteholders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those currently in place the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

in addition variablerate borrowings under our 2020 credit agreement typically use libor as a benchmark based on market participant judgments for establishing the rate of interest libor is the subject of recent national and international regulatory scrutiny which is expected to result in changes that cause libor to disappear entirely after june 2023 for rates applicable to the 2020 credit agreement and our existing derivatives contracts and as of december 2021 for any new debt and derivatives contracts that we may enter into the changes may also cause libor to perform differently than in the past the alternative reference rates committee arrc which was convened by the federal reserve board and the new york fed has identified the secured oversight financing rate sofr as the recommended riskfree alternative rate for usd libor the future consequences of these libor developments on our variablerate borrowings including the possible transition to rates based on observable transactions such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr cannot be predicted at this time but could include an increase in the cost of our variablerate indebtedness and volatility in our earnings 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional 

indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

natural disasters pandemics terrorist acts war actions by governments and other geopolitical activities could disrupt our operations we operate in numerous us and international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe the occurrence of or concerns related to a major weather event earthquake flood drought volcanic activity disease or pandemic or other natural disaster could significantly disrupt our operations in addition acts of civil unrest failure of critical infrastructure terrorism armed conflict war and abrupt political change as well as responses by various governments and the international community to such acts can have a negative effect on our business such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt or shut down the internet or other critical clientfacing and business processes impede the travel of our personnel and clients dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel and in general harm our ability to conduct normal business operations any of which can negatively impact our financial condition and operating results such events could also impact the timing and budget decisions of our clients which could materially adversely affect our business 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

we are subject to risks from operating globally we have clients in approximately 100 countries and territories and a substantial amount of our revenue is earned outside of the united states our operating results are subject to all of the risks typically inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous and complex foreign laws and regulations currency restrictions and fluctuations the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights including against economic espionage in international jurisdictions further we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

additionally tariffs trade barriers and restrictions and other acts by governments to protect domestic markets or to retaliate against the trade tariffs and restrictions of other nations could negatively affect our business operations in addition the withdrawal of nations from existing common markets or trading blocs such as the exit of the united kingdom uk from the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit could be disruptive and negatively impact our business and the business of our clients we continue to monitor brexit and its potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition in connection with brexit in december 2020 the eu and the united kingdom reached an agreement on a new trade arrangement that became effective on january 1 2021 depending on the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement there could be near or longterm negative impacts on our uk business due to regulatory costs and challenges for us and our clients who have significant operations in the united kingdom the impact of any of these effects of brexit among others could materially harm our business and financial results 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the united states and abroad in its recent report global economics prospects january 2022  the world bank reported that following a collapse in 2020 caused by the covid19 pandemic global economic growth is estimated to have surged to 55 in 2021 notwithstanding this annual increase according to the report resurgences of the covid19 pandemic and widespread supply bottlenecks weighed appreciably on global activity in the second half of 2021 reflecting these bottlenecks as well as the recovery in global demand and rising food and energy prices the world bank notes that global consumer price inflation and its nearterm expectations have increased more than previously anticipated the report also notes that labor markets in advanced economies have tightened supporting a rebound in wage inflation against this backdrop the world bank predicted the global economy is set to experience its sharpest slowdown after an initial rebound from a global recession since at least the 1970s global growth is projected to decelerate from 55 percent in 2021 to 41 percent in 2022 reflecting continued covid19 flareups diminished policy support and lingering supply disruptions per the world bank global growth is envisioned to slow further in 2023 to 32 percent as pentup demand is depleted and supportive macroeconomic policies continue to be unwound a downturn in growth could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services in general in certain geographic regions in particular countries or industry sectors in addition us federal state and local government spending limits may reduce demand for our products and services from those governmental agencies as well as organizations that receive funding from those agencies and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services such difficulties could negatively impact our ability to maintain or improve the various business measurements we utilize which are defined in this annual report such as contract value and consulting backlog growth client retention wallet retention consulting utilization rates and the number of attendees and exhibitors at our conferences and other meetings failure to 

achieve acceptable levels of these measurements or improve them will negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition and we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so will result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we will not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates from our international operations a significant portion of our revenues are typically derived from sales outside of the united states revenues earned outside the united states are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

our business could be negatively impacted by climate change  while we seek to mitigate the business risks associated with climate change for our operations there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business whether for our offices clients vendors or other stakeholders is a priority we have large offices in connecticut florida india australia and other locations that are vulnerable to climate change effects changing market dynamics global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the us and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business the business of our vendors and the business clients and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

our failure to comply with complex us and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition our business and operations may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy it is our policy to comply and to require our local partners distributors agents and those with whom we do business to comply with all applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act regulations established by the office of foreign assets control ofac and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will comply with the company’s policies that mandate compliance with these laws any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of these laws even if inadvertent could be costly and disrupt our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows as well as on our reputation for example during the second half of 2018 we cooperated fully with a south african government commission established to review a wide range of issues related to the country’s revenue service including the procurement and fulfillment of consulting agreements we entered into with the revenue service through a sales agent from late 2014 through early 2017 we fully cooperated with the commission and in parallel we commenced an internal investigation regarding this matter we voluntarily disclosed the matter to the sec and department of justice doj in november 2018 and are cooperating fully with their review including executing tolling agreements at this time we do not believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material effect on our financial results however an unexpected adverse resolution of these matters could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

in addition continuously evolving data protection laws and regulations such as the european union general data protection regulation gdpr and the decision in the schrems ii case the california consumer privacy act ccpa the brazilian general data protection law lgpd the chinese cybersecurity data security and personal information laws and other new and proposed data protection laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges we have implemented gdpr ccpa 

and lgpd compliance programs in the meantime gartner will continue to maintain and rely upon our comprehensive global data protection compliance program which includes administrative technical and physical controls to safeguard our associates’ and clients’ personal data the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states the eu and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

we face risks related to litigation we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits of any claim and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim claims can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us that we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation  we are a global company and a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the united states and taxed at rates other than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many countries tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions where we do business during 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released final reports on various action items associated with its initiative to prevent base erosion and profit shifting beps in 2020 the oecd further proposed a twopillar approach to global taxation beps 20 focusing on global profit allocation and a global minimum tax rate and in december of 2021 both the oecd and the eu released model rules and draft directives with respect to global minimum tax the future enactment by various governments of these and other proposals could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows we will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such legislative changes in future financial statements as appropriate 

in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by various tax authorities recent and future actions on the part of the oecd and various governments have increased scrutiny of our tax filings although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 1201 million of accumulated undistributed earnings in our nonus subsidiaries our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2021 31 of our cash and cash equivalents was held overseas with a substantial portion representing accumulated undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings is required if the company intends to reinvest such earnings overseas indefinitely the company intends to continue to reinvest its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings except in instances where the repatriation of those earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result we have not recognized income tax expense on the amounts deemed permanently reinvested 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations accordingly we have a corporate compliance program that includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however failure of any employee to comply with any of these laws regulations or our policies could result in a range of liabilities for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

risks related to our common stock 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock ii advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings and iii the antitakeover provisions of delaware law these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we believe that the potential liability if any in excess of amounts already accrued from all proceedings claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations when resolved in a future period

covid19 impact 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we temporarily closed gartner offices around the world and implemented significant travel restrictions although we have reopened most offices and have plans to reopen substantially all remaining offices in early 2022 health and safety permitting reopening is subject to many factors outside of our control the vast majority of our employees transitioned to working from home in early 2022 we began to operate under a hybrid virtualfirst working environment meaning that most of our employees will have the option to work remotely at least some of the time for the foreseeable future as a result in the fourth quarter of 2021 we evaluated our real estate footprint globally and determined that certain of our leased locations are no longer necessary for our operations this evaluation resulted in the impairment of rightofuse assets and other longlived assets net of a reduction in lease liabilities of 495 million related to certain office locations we no longer intend to use we expect to continue to evaluate our real estate footprint globally if we determine there is any additional excess property there is no assurance that we will be able to sublease any such excess properties or that we will not incur costs in connection with such exit activities which may be material as of the date of this filing we do not believe our work from home protocol has affected our internal controls over financial reporting 

of the three business segments in which we operate research and consulting have returned to growth levels that were in line with our growth prior to the pandemic however conferences continues to be negatively impacted we cancelled inperson conferences scheduled for 2020 beginning in late februaryearly march 2020 with the remainder being cancelled after the world health organization’s declaration of the covid19 pandemic later in march 2020 we began holding virtual conferences during the second half of 2020 we held 39 virtual conferences during the year ended december 31 2021 and expect to continue to deliver conferences virtually during 2022 these virtual conferences have resulted in significantly less revenue and gross contribution than inperson conferences but we believe they aid in client retention and engagement we are operationally planning to relaunch inperson destination conferences when conditions permit 

for cancelled conferences our event cancellation insurance enables us to receive an amount up to expected revenues plus incurred expenses minus saved expense our event cancellation insurance provides up to 170 million in coverage for 2020 with the right to reinstate that amount one time if those limits are utilized the insurer has contested our right to reinstate limits gartner also has event cancellation insurance for 2021 covering events that were planned for 2021 but cancelled of up to 150 million with the right to reinstate up to that amount one time if the initial limits are inadequate the insurer has contested all coverage for events planned for 2021 but cancelled due to covid19 we are in litigation with the insurer on these issues in 2021 we received 1669 million of proceeds related to 2020 insurance claims and recorded a gain of 1523 million the timing of receiving the remaining proceeds from 2020 and 2021 insurance claims is uncertain so we will not record any insurance claims in excess of expenses incurred related to the remaining claims until the receipt of the insurance proceeds is deemed to be realizable our insurance coverage for 2022 and likely beyond excludes cancellation due to communicable diseases 

in response to the pandemic’s impacts to our business we implemented cost avoidance initiatives in the first half of 2020 including significant limitations on hiring and thirdparty spending reductions to discretionary spending and elimination of nonessential travel and reprioritization of capital expenditures we began to restore certain investments in the business during the second half of 2020 and accelerated these investments in 2021 we expect these investments to increase in future periods which may have a negative impact on operating margins

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such they may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition — our revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

• research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs are recognized when the leads are provided to vendors 

• conferences revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related conference or meeting 

• consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee or time and materials engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized as we work to satisfy our performance obligations revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization engagements are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment 

the majority of our research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time research contracts are generally noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the amount of a subscription contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

note 1 — business and significant accounting policies and note 9 — revenue and related matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding our revenues 

accounting for income taxes — the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where the company operates this process involves estimating our current tax expense or benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this assessment we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized the company uses estimates in determining the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions significant judgment is required in evaluating tax law and measuring the benefits likely to be realized uncertain tax positions are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about their ultimate realization becomes available 

accounting for stockbased compensation — the company accounts for stockbased compensation awards in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 and no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period note 10 — stockbased compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding stockbased compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards requires the use of certain subjective assumptions including the expected life of a stockbased compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate periodic stockbased compensation expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stockbased compensation awards and the related periodic expense represent management’s best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if circumstances change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stockbased compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

a change in any of the terms or conditions of stockbased compensation awards is accounted for as a modification of the award incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess if any of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified measured based on the fair value of the awards at the modification date for vested awards we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs for unvested awards we recognize any incremental compensation expense at the modification date or ratably over the requisite remaining service period as appropriate if the fair value of the modified award is lower than the fair value of the original award immediately before modification the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award

in response to the covid19 pandemic we cancelled all inperson conferences from march 2020 through december 2021 and pivoted to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver to our clients we held 39 virtual conferences during the year ended december 31 2021 during 2020 we successfully held 5 inperson conferences prior to the covid19 pandemic and 15 virtual conferences during the second half of the year we expect to continue to deliver conferences virtually during 2022 but are operationally planning to relaunch inperson destination conferences when conditions permit conferences revenues increased by 943 million during 2021 compared to 2020 or 78 on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 was due to the virtual conferences held during the period as well as the use of ticket entitlements which we extended from 2020 due to the pandemic the segment gross contribution margin was 62 and 48 in 2021 and 2020 respectively the higher gross contribution margin during 2021 was primarily due to increased revenues 

consulting

consulting revenues increased 11 during 2021 compared to 2020 on a reported basis and 9 excluding the foreign currency impact the increase in revenues on a reported basis was due to a 13 increase in laborbased consulting and a 4 increase in contract optimization contract optimization revenue may vary significantly and as such 2021 revenues may not be indicative of future results the segment gross contribution margin was 38 and 31 in 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in gross contribution margin during 2021 was primarily due to the increase in revenue

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the company’s outstanding debt obligations at december 31 2021 we had 7565 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 10 billion of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility under our 2020 credit agreement we believe that the company has adequate liquidity and access to capital markets to meet its currently anticipated needs for both the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 

we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model in our research segment which is our largest business segment and historically has constituted a significant portion of our total revenues the majority of our research customer contracts are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow cash flow generation has also benefited from our ongoing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase sales 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world with 31 held overseas at december 31 2021 the company intends to reinvest substantially all of its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings except in instances where repatriation would result in minimal additional tax as a result of the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we believe that the income tax impact if such earnings were repatriated would be minimal 

the table below summarizes the changes in the company’s cash balances for the years indicated in thousands 





operating 

cash provided by operating activities was 13125 million and 9033 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to higher pretax income in the 2021 period in part due to a 1523 million gain on event cancellation insurance claims and an increase in deferred revenues resulting from increased bookings in research partially offset by higher income tax payments and deferred commissions 

investing 

cash used in investing activities was 805 million and 839 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the cash used in 2021 was for capital expenditures and the acquisition of pulse qa inc the slight decrease from 2020 to 2021 was the result of reduced capital spending in response to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by the 2021 acquisition of pulse qa inc

the table below summarizes the company’s future contractual cash commitments as of december 31 2021 in thousands 





1 principal repayments of the company’s debt obligations were classified in the above table based on the contractual repayment dates interest payments were based on the effective interest rates as of december 31 2021 including the effects of the company’s interest rate swap contracts commitment fees were based on unused balances and commitment rates as of december 31 2021 note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides information regarding the company’s debt obligations and interest rate swap contracts

recently issued accounting standards 

the fasb has issued accounting standards that had not yet become effective as of december 31 2021 and may impact the company’s consolidated financial statements or its disclosures in future periods note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides information regarding those accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

as of december 31 2021 the company had 25 billion in total debt principal outstanding note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the company’s outstanding debt obligations 

approximately 03 billion of the company’s total debt outstanding as of december 31 2021 was based on a floating base rate of interest which potentially exposes the company to increases in interest rates however we reduce our overall exposure to interest rate increases through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base interest rates on all of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rates 

foreign currency risk 

  

a significant portion of our revenues are typically derived from sales outside of the united states among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar as the values of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risk 

translation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars because the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 we had 7565 million of cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2021 could have increased or decreased by approximately 450 million the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings because movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar 

  

transaction risk arises when we enter into a transaction that is denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency a gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december 31 2021 had an immaterial net unrealized loss 

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents fees receivable interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks fees receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

competition 

we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are as follows 

• superior research content  we believe that we create the broadest highestquality and most relevant research coverage across all major functional roles in an enterprise our independent operating model and research analysis generates 

unbiased insight that we believe is timely thoughtprovoking and comprehensive and that is known for its high quality independence and objectivity 

• our leading brand name  we have provided critical trusted insight under the gartner name for more than 40 years 

• our global footprint and established customer base  we have a global presence with clients in more than 100 countries on six continents a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the united states 

• experienced management team  our management team is comprised of research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at gartner 

• substantial operating leverage in our business model  we can distribute our intellectual property and expertise across multiple platforms including research and advisory subscription and membership programs conferences and consulting engagements to derive incremental revenue and profitability 

• vast network of research experts and consultants  as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 2150 research experts and 730 experienced consultants located around the world our research experts are located in more than 30 countries enabling us to cover vast aspects of business and technology on a global basis 

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly with consulting firms and other data and information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services while we believe the breadth and depth of our research positions us well versus our competition increased competition could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures 

intellectual property 

our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies software reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights we have policies related to confidentiality ownership and the use and protection of gartner’s intellectual property we also enter into agreements with our employees and third parties as appropriate that protect our intellectual property and we enforce these agreements if necessary we recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify create and protect it additionally we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by our end users 

human capital management 

we believe our people are our most valuable asset enabling our long track record of global growth from attracting diverse talent through our recruitment process to cultivating that talent with learning and development opportunities and rewards for strong performers to supporting overall wellness with meaningful benefits and engagement we strive to put our people first at december 31 2020 we had approximately 15600 employees in over 90 offices globally and the overwhelming majority of our employees were full time 

gartner is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all applicants and employees without regard to any legally protected status this commitment is formalized in our global and us equal employment opportunity policies we continually renew this commitment by seeking to optimize our recruitment and professional development processes create networking and educational opportunities celebrate heritage and history encourage community service and outreach and create safe spaces for all employees 

diversity equity and inclusion 

we foster an environment of professional development to help our employees reach their full potential this includes embracing diversity and actively removing barriers to support inclusion engagement and growth at gartner our executive diversity equity and inclusion dei council composed of our ceo chief human resources officer cfo general counsel head of diversity equity and inclusion head of dei research within our gartner hr research practice and other selected 

leaders drives diversity equity and inclusion as an imperative at all levels of the organization in addition the newly formed dei center of excellence which reports directly to our chief human resources officer is working to codify our strategy and to establish goals against key metrics to drive greater transparency and accountability our teams of employees are composed of individuals from different geographies cultures religions ethnicities races genders sexual orientations abilities and generations working together to solve problems as of december 31 2020 approximately 44 of our employees and 30 of our board of directors identified as female and our employees were represented by more than 80 selfidentified nationalities working in 38 different countries around the world 

we also focus on the role of unconscious bias and endeavor to build tools that help make various business processes more inclusive and accommodate a more diverse perspective we emphasize the importance of inclusion to leaders and managers and how to foster a sense of belonging within their teams in 2020 we introduced a new leadership forum called the leadership exchange leadex for all vice presidents and above the forum provides sessions for leaders to share experiences ask questions and gain perspective on effectively leading people within the context of current events and the rapidly changing environment 

the company supports a number of employeedriven employee resource groups ergs that bring employees together to foster a diverse inclusive and supportive workplace gartner currently has formal ergs supporting underrepresented racial ethnic and multicultural backgrounds women the lgbtq community and veterans participation in ergs is voluntary and open to all employees in 2020 our ergs had more than 4900 associate memberships and the groups delivered 100 programs 

health safety and compensation 

we seek to invest in meaningful innovative and inclusive compensation and benefit programs that support physical financial and emotional wellbeing of our employees in addition to salaries these programs which vary by countryregion include annual bonuses stock awards an employee stock purchase plan 401k matching healthcare and insurance benefits tax savings programs such as health and dependent care flexible spending accounts health savings account and pretax commuter benefits generous paid time off paid parental leave life and disability insurance business travel accident insurance charity matching employee assistance programs tuition assistance and onsite services such as health centers and fitness centers among others we believe that our equity grants facilitate retention as well as encourage performance of key personnel 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we implemented significant changes to protect the health and safety of our employees clients and the communities in which we operate this includes the temporary closure of our offices including our corporate headquarters in the united states united kingdom india and several other impacted locations around the world as well as the cancellation of inperson conferences in general even where offices have reopened our employees have the option to work remotely and we have implemented additional safety guidelines to protect them we also provide a number of free mental and behavioral health resources including access to the employee assistance program for employees and their dependents

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions and trends the following sections address significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky we urge you to consider carefully the factors described below and the risks that they present for our operations as well as the risks addressed in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k when the factors events and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this form 10k materialize there could be a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment in addition to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in item 7 of this form 10k and in the risk factors below additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below 

risks related to the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic is having a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of our customers and the duration and extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to affect our operations financial performance results of operations achievement of strategic objectives andor stock price remains uncertain the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our operations financial performance and demand for our products and services it has also adversely affected the operations and financial performance of many of our clients additionally the covid19 pandemic has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in a substantial curtailment of business activities including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of products and services both regionally and globally weakened economic conditions significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected our operations and financial performance to a number of risks that may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition including but not limited to those discussed below 

• costsaving measures by our clients have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect their ability or willingness to attend our conferences purchase our products or engage our consultants such measures also lengthened payment terms in some of our contracts and negatively impacted retention rates such measures could also reduce the duration of some of our subscription contracts and delay purchasing decisions of potential clients 

• we have temporarily closed gartner offices including our corporate headquarters in the united states united kingdom india and several other impacted locations around the world and implemented significant travel restrictions though many 

of our employees continue to work remotely these changes impact the normal operation of our business although we have plans to reopen most offices in the fall of 2021 reopening is subject to many factors outside of our control as a result we cannot predict for certain when or how we will begin to lift the actions put in place as part of our business continuity plans including work from home protocols and travel restrictions 

• we have cancelled or postponed all inperson conferences through at least august 2021 pivoting to virtual conferences we held 15 virtual conferences during the second half of 2020 and plan on holding approximately 20 virtual conferences from february 2021 through august 2021 these virtual conferences are expected to result in significantly less revenue and gross contribution but we believe aid in client retention and engagement for additional information about how covid19 affects our conferences business see the risk factor titled “ the profitability and success of our conferences and other meetings are subject to external factors beyond our control ” 

• our management is focused on mitigating the effects of covid19 on our business which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and may delay other valueadded services 

additionally we face challenges from evolving factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control remain uncertain and to which we may not effectively respond for example our operations span numerous locations around the world and many local governments and countries have imposed or may impose various restrictions on our employees partners and customers’ physical movement to limit the spread of covid19 these restrictions are constantly changing and we cannot predict how long and to what extent they will continue moreover covid19 has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our subscriptionbased business model which accounts for a significant portion of our revenue by causing clients to decrease new and renewals of subscriptionbased services and to request to cancel or renegotiate current subscriptionbased services the effect of covid19 on our subscriptionbased model may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods 

further the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and financial performance depend on future developments that cannot currently be accurately predicted such as 

• the severity and transmission rate of the virus 

• the extent and effectiveness of containment actions 

• the timing of the development and distribution of effective vaccines andor treatments and their acceptance by the general public 

• the health and wellbeing of our workforce 

• the extent and duration of the effect on client spending and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers partners and vendors 

• the impact on our liquidity 

• increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets 

• the effect of the pandemic on the creditworthiness of our customers 

• global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and 

• the pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides 

the occurrence or continuation of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial performance 

the impact of covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k any of which could have a material effect on us this situation is changing rapidly and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted 

strategic and operational risks 

we may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends on our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information and advice that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect 

on future business and operating results further if our published data opinions or viewpoints prove to be wrong lack independence or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation will suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could materially adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our clients develop enhance and improve our existing products as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

technology is rapidly evolving and if we do not continue to develop new product and service offerings in response to these changes our business could suffer disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the environment in which we our clients and our competitors operate we will need to continue to respond to these changes by enhancing our product and service offerings to maintain our competitive position however we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhancing our products on a timely basis and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our clients our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new or enhanced existing offerings that address the changing needs of this constantly evolving marketplace failure to develop products that meet the needs of our clients in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

our research business depends on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services will lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted approximately 81 and 73 of total revenues from our ongoing operations for 2020 and 2019 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often timeconsuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription contracts are typically for twelve months or longer our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

• delivering highquality and timely analysis and advice to our clients 

• understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients and 

• providing products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition 

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 83 and 82 at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

the profitability and success of our conferences and other meetings are subject to external factors beyond our control our conferences business constituted approximately 3 and 11 of total revenues from our ongoing operations in 2020 and 2019 respectively as a result of the covid19 pandemic we cancelled or postponed all inperson conferences in march 2020 through the end of the calendar year which had a material adverse effect on our 2020 conferences business we have also cancelled or postponed all inperson conferences through at least august 2021 we held 15 virtual conferences during the second half of 2020 and plan on holding approximately 20 virtual conferences through august 2021 these virtual conferences are expected to result in significantly less revenue and gross contribution but we believe aid in client retention and engagement 

we expect our conferences revenues will continue to be negatively impacted until inperson conferences can be held moreover our clients that typically attend these conferences may have pandemicrelated travel restrictions in place that could affect attendance once these conferences resume at this time we also cannot predict what additional measures will be required to hold inperson conferences safely such as providing masks social distancing and increased sanitation these safety requirements would likely cause us to incur additional costs and may limit the number of participants at our inperson conferences in addition perceived or actual spread of coronavirus at one of our conferences could cause reputational damage the safety of our associates and clients remain our top priority so future inperson conferences will be held only if we determine the relevant impacts of covid19 have sufficiently receded in the jurisdictions where our conferences are to be held 

we also face risks related to insurance coverage for our cancelled conferences our event cancellation insurance provides up to 170 million in coverage for 2020 with the right to reinstate that amount one time if those limits are utilized the insurer has contested our right to reinstate limits and to include in reinstated limits conferences cancelled due to covid19 we are in litigation with the insurer on these issues it is unclear when we will receive the proceeds from these insurance claims and if we will have difficulty obtaining future event cancellation insurance at favorable rates which could affect our financial results 

the market for desirable dates and locations for our activities has historically been highly competitive once we decide to resume inperson conferences if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences the profitability for these conferences will suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our conferences are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these activities can be affected by circumstances outside of our control in addition to the covid19 pandemic such as the occurrence of or concerns related to labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks war weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the conference or meeting we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major activities 

our consulting business depends on nonrecurring engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted approximately 9 of total revenues from our ongoing operations in both 2020 and 2019 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring in addition revenue from our contract optimization business can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not predictable our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

• delivering consistent highquality consulting services to our clients 

• tailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients and 

• our ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagements 

a material decline in our ability to replace consulting engagements will have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services and our future growth plans our success is based on attracting and retaining talented employees and we depend heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive maintaining our brand and reputation is important to our ability to recruit and retain employees we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that enables our employees to thrive we may also be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws and changes to policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent could inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development and other efforts an inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel could materially adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as our future business and operating results in addition effective succession planning is important to our longterm success and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

our employees are subject to restrictive covenant agreements which include restrictions on employees’ ability to compete and solicit customers and employees and assignment of invention agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the period expires relating to their particular restrictions former employees may compete against us if a former employee violates the provisions of the restrictive covenant agreement we seek to enforce the restrictions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our conferences concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to damage our reputation and deter current and prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our conferences in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including conference attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects while we believe our overall data privacy procedures are adequate the theft or loss of such data or concerns about our practices even if unfounded with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data protection related matters could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our operating results any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users’ personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our conferences as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to our business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in our computer systems and networks and in those of our thirdparty vendors individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers the cybersecurity risks we face range from cyber attacks common to most industries such as the development and deployment of malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions to more advanced threats that target us because of our prominence in the global research and advisory field 

like many multinational corporations we and some third parties upon which we rely have experienced cyber attacks on our computer systems and networks in the past and may experience them in the future likely with more frequency and sophistication and involving a broader range of devices and modes of attack all of which will increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business operations products services or customers we have implemented various security controls to both meet our security compliance obligations while also defending against constantly evolving security threats our security controls help to secure our information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers are vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyber attacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events as a result of the covid19 pandemic and shelterinplace orders most of our employees in affected areas are working remotely which magnifies the importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures additionally the security compliance landscape continues to evolve requiring us to stay apprised of changes in cybersecurity laws regulations and security requirements required by our clients such as the european union general data protection regulation gdpr the california consumer privacy act ccpa the brazilian general data protection law lgpd the chinese cybersecurity and draft data security laws international organization for standardization iso and national institute of standards and technology nist recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber attacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers 

a cyber attack widespread internet failure or internet access limitations or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions additionally any material breaches of cybersecurity or other technologyrelated catastrophe or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard our customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 

any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts for access to data centers and equipment and to move more of our workload into cloud services to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company increase revenue or fully realize anticipated synergies the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

we face risks related to leased office space we assumed a significant amount of leased office space in particular in arlington virginia in connection with the acquisition of ceb inc in 2017 in arlington we have consolidated all our businesses into a single building and have sublet substantially all of the excess space in our other properties through our real estate consolidations and other related activities we have tried to secure quality subtenants with appropriate sublease terms however if subtenants default on their sublease obligations with us or otherwise terminate their subleases with us we may experience a loss of planned sublease rental income which could result in a material charge against our operating results additionally the longterm impact of covid19 on leased office space availability and rental costs of leased office space is not yet known 

to accommodate our growth going forward we have moved to a global hoteling option to better manage our footprint and operating expenses and will secure new space when the opportunities and need arise if the new spaces are not completed on schedule or if the landlord defaults on its commitments and obligations pursuant to the new leases we may incur additional expenses in addition unanticipated difficulties in initiating operations in a new space including construction delays it system interruptions or other infrastructure support problems could result in a delay in moving into the new space resulting in a loss of employee and operational productivity and a loss of revenue andor additional expenses which could also have an adverse material impact on our operating results 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and some may be terminated early we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the united states government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2020 and 2019 approximately 689 million and 639 million respectively of our outstanding revenue contracts were attributable to government entities our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms certain of these contracts may be terminated at any time by the government entity without cause or penalty “termination for convenience” in addition contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures and compliance requirements as well as intense competition while terminations by governments 

have not been significant historically should appropriations for the various governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of revenues 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our “gartner” brand in particular our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and top talent and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may also discover that our brand though recognized is not perceived to be relevant by new market segments we have targeted we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote maintain and protect the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 

our outstanding debt obligations could negatively impact our financial condition and future operating results as of december 31 2020 the company had outstanding debt of 400 million under its 2020 term loan and revolving credit facility the “2020 credit agreement” 800 million of senior notes due 2028 the “2028 notes” and 800 million of senior notes due 2030 the “2030 notes” additional information regarding the 2020 credit agreement the 2028 notes and the 2030 notes is included in note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the debt service requirements of these borrowings could impair our future financial condition and operating results in addition the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2020 credit agreement as well as the covenants related to the senior notes could limit our future financial flexibility a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding which could materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders and noteholders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those currently in place the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

in addition variablerate borrowings under our 2020 credit agreement typically use libor as a benchmark based on market participant judgments for establishing the rate of interest libor is the subject of recent national and international regulatory scrutiny which may result in changes that cause libor to disappear entirely after june 2023 for rates applicable to the 2020 credit agreement and our existing derivatives contracts and december 2021 for any new debt and derivatives contracts that we may enter into the changes may also cause libor to perform differently than in the past the alternative reference rates committee arrc which was convened by the federal reserve board and the new york fed has identified the secured oversight financing rate sofr as the recommended riskfree alternative rate for usd libor the future consequences of these libor developments on our variablerate borrowings including the possible transition to rates based on observable transactions such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr cannot be predicted at this time but could include an increase in the cost of our variablerate indebtedness and volatility in our earnings 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

natural disasters pandemics terrorist acts war actions by governments and other geopolitical activities could disrupt our operations we operate in numerous us and international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe the occurrence of or concerns related to a major weather event earthquake flood drought volcanic activity disease or pandemic or other natural disaster could significantly disrupt our operations in addition acts of civil unrest failure of critical infrastructure terrorism armed conflict war and abrupt political change as well as responses by various governments and the international community to such acts can have a negative effect on our business such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt or shut down the internet or other critical clientfacing and business processes impede the travel of our personnel and clients dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel and in general harm our ability to conduct normal business operations any of which can negatively impact our financial condition and operating results such events could also impact the timing and budget decisions of our clients which could materially adversely affect our business 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

we are subject to risks from operating globally we have clients in more than 100 countries and a substantial amount of our revenue is earned outside of the united states our operating results are subject to all of the risks typically inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous and complex foreign laws and regulations currency restrictions and fluctuations the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights including against economic espionage in international jurisdictions further we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

additionally tariffs trade barriers and restrictions and other acts by governments to protect domestic markets or to retaliate against the trade tariffs and restrictions of other nations could negatively affect our business operations in addition the withdrawal of nations from existing common markets or trading blocs such as the exit of the united kingdom uk from the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit could be disruptive and negatively impact our business and the business of our clients we continue to monitor brexit and its potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition in connection with brexit on december 24 2020 the eu and the united kingdom reached an agreement on a new trade arrangement that became effective on january 1 2021 once the new rules are formalized there could be near or longterm negative impacts on our uk business if this agreement and the new rules once formalized lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and eu then we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the united kingdom may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to the new trade agreements for example we may face additional administrative procedures when purchasing tangible goods and equipment from the eu additionally volatility in foreign currencies and other markets may also arise as the uk and eu work though the new trade arrangements the impact of any of these effects of brexit among others could materially harm our business and financial results 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the united states and abroad in its recent report global economics prospects january 2021  the world bank reported that following a collapse in 2020 caused by the covid19 pandemic global economic output is expected to expand 4 percent in 2021 but still remain more than 5 percent below prepandemic projections the report also indicated that global growth is projected to moderate to 38 percent in 2022 weighed down by the pandemic’s lasting damage to potential growth the report noted that the global recovery which has been dampened in the near term by a resurgence of covid19 cases is expected to strengthen over the forecast horizon as confidence consumption and trade gradually improve supported by ongoing vaccination a downturn in growth could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services in general in certain geographic regions in particular countries or industry sectors in addition us federal state and local government spending limits may reduce demand for our products and services from those governmental agencies as well as organizations that receive funding from those agencies and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services such difficulties could negatively impact our ability to maintain or improve the various business measurements we utilize which are defined in this annual report such as contract value and consulting backlog growth client retention wallet retention consulting utilization rates and the number of attendees and exhibitors at our conferences and other meetings failure to achieve acceptable levels of these measurements or improve them will negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition and we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so will result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we will not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis 

timely delivery of information customer service the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates from our international operations a significant portion of our revenues are typically derived from sales outside of the united states revenues earned outside the united states are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

legal and regulatory risks 

our failure to comply with complex us and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition our business and operations may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy it is our policy to comply and to require our local partners distributors agents and those with whom we do business to comply with all applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act regulations established by the office of foreign assets control ofac and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will comply with the company’s policies that mandate compliance with these laws any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of these laws even if inadvertent could be costly and disrupt our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows as well as on our reputation for example during the second half of 2018 we cooperated fully with a south african government commission established to review a wide range of issues related to the country’s revenue service including the procurement and fulfillment of consulting agreements we entered into with the revenue service through a sales agent from late 2014 through early 2017 we fully cooperated with the commission and in parallel we commenced an internal investigation regarding this matter we voluntarily disclosed the matter to the sec and department of justice doj in november 2018 and are cooperating fully with their review including executing tolling agreements at this time we do not believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material effect on our financial results however an unexpected adverse resolution of these matters could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

in addition continuously evolving data protection laws and regulations such as the european union general data protection regulation gdpr and the recent decision in the schrems ii case the california consumer privacy act ccpa the brazilian general data protection law lgpd and the chinese cybersecurity and draft data security laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges we have implemented gdpr ccpa and lgpd compliance programs in the meantime gartner will continue to maintain and rely upon our comprehensive global data protection compliance program which includes administrative technical and physical controls to safeguard our associates’ and clients’ personal data the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states the eu and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

we face risks related to litigation we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits of any claim and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim claims can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us that we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation  we are a global company and a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the united states and taxed at rates less than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many countries tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions where we do business during 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released final reports on various action items associated with its initiative to prevent base erosion and profit shifting beps in 2020 the oecd further proposed a twopillar approach to global taxation beps 20 focusing on global profit allocation and a global minimum tax rate while consensus has yet to be reached on 

beps 20 numerous countries have and continue to propose tax law changes intended to address beps the future enactment by various governments of these and other proposals could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows we will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such legislative changes in future financial statements as appropriate 

in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by various tax authorities recent and future actions on the part of the oecd and various governments have increased scrutiny of our tax filings although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 1195 million of accumulated undistributed earnings in our nonus subsidiaries our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2020 56 of our cash and cash equivalents was held overseas with a substantial portion representing accumulated undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings is required if the company intends to reinvest such earnings overseas indefinitely the company intends to continue to reinvest its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings except in instances where the repatriation of those earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result we have not recognized income tax expense on the amounts deemed permanently reinvested 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations accordingly we have a corporate compliance program that includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however failure of any employee to comply with any of these laws regulations or our policies could result in a range of liabilities for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

risks related to our common stock 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock ii advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings and iii the antitakeover provisions of delaware law these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

we expect to continue to invest in our business by adding headcount and as a result we may need additional office space in various locations should additional space be necessary we believe that it will be available on reasonable terms 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we believe that the potential liability if any in excess of amounts already accrued from all proceedings claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations when resolved in a future period

covid19 impact 

the coronavirus disease “covid19” pandemic has affected nearly every region in the world and has created significant uncertainties and disruption in the global economy gartner is closely monitoring the pandemicrelated developments and our highest priority is the health and safety of our associates clients vendors partners and other stakeholders we are working closely with our clients to provide best in class covid19 related research to assist them in achieving their mission critical priorities 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have temporarily closed gartner offices including our corporate headquarters in the united states united kingdom india and several other impacted locations around the world and implemented significant travel restrictions although we have plans to reopen most offices in the fall of 2021 reopening is subject to many factors outside of our control as a result we cannot predict for certain when or how we will begin to lift the actions put in place as part of our business continuity plans including work from home protocols and travel restrictions 

we have seen negative impacts to all of our segments with conferences being the most impacted on march 25 2020 we announced the cancellation of all inperson conferences through august 2020 on july 2 2020 we announced the cancellation of all inperson conferences for the remainder of 2020 we held 15 virtual conferences during the second half of 2020 and plan on holding approximately 20 virtual conferences from february 2021 through august 2021 these virtual conferences are expected to result in significantly less revenue and gross contribution but we believe aid in client retention and engagement the safety of our associates and clients remain our top priority so future inperson conferences will be held only if we determine the relevant impacts of covid19 have sufficiently receded in the jurisdictions where our conferences are to be held 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 16 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet related to cancelled conferences we expect to recover the majority of these and potential termination costs for future conferences through either force majeure clauses in our vendor contracts other arrangements with vendors or event cancellation insurance claims for cancelled conferences our event cancellation insurance enables us to receive an amount up to the lost contribution margin per conference plus incurred expenses our event cancellation insurance provides up to 170 million in coverage for 2020 with the right to reinstate that amount one time if those limits are utilized the insurer has contested our right to reinstate limits and to include in reinstated limits conferences cancelled due to covid19 we are in litigation with the insurer on these issues the timing of receiving the proceeds from these insurance claims is uncertain so we will not record any insurance claims in excess of expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds 

our research segment has continued to experience a slowdown as contract value cv growth was 45 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 106 70 and 53 in the first second and third quarters of 2020 respectively cv growth slowed late in the first quarter as the global virus response led to lower new business growth and lower retention rates however because our revenue and cv have been historically stable and predictable as a result of our subscriptionbased business model we only experienced a modest decrease in research revenue growth in 2020 compared to that in 2019 slower cv growth in 2020 however will lead to slower research revenue growth in 2021 nonetheless we believe that our emphasis on producing business and technology insight into every major business function in the enterprise will continue to drive client engagement and satisfaction with our research products 

our consulting segment was only moderately impacted by the covid19 pandemic as many engagements are being performed by associates working remotely labor based consulting weakened late in the first quarter due to the pandemic this weakness continued in the remainder of 2020 due to weaker demand which will likely continue into 2021 

in connection with the cancellation of the majority of 2020 conferences and the weaker demand in our consulting segment noted above in the second quarter of 2020 we implemented workforce reductions we incurred an aggregate of approximately 18 million in costs relating to these workforce reductions during the year ended december 31 2020 16 million has been paid during the year ended december 31 2020 and we expect the majority of the remaining charges to be paid out in the first half of 2021 

in response to the pandemic’s impacts to our business we implemented cost avoidance initiatives in the first half of 2020 including significant limitations on hiring and thirdparty spending reductions to discretionary spending and elimination of nonessential travel and reprioritization of capital expenditures we began to restore certain investments in the business during the second half of 2020 and will likely continue these investments in 2021 and future periods

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such they may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods 

our critical accounting policies are described below 

accounting for leases — on january 1 2019 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 842 leases “asc 842” we determine if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract we consider an arrangement a lease if the arrangement transfers the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration we have operating leases but do not have material financing leases lease rightofuse assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make payments arising from the lease agreement these assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the lease based upon the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term the lease term reflects the noncancelable period of the lease together with periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option changes in the lease term assumption could impact the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities recognized on the balance sheet as our leases typically do not contain a readily determinable implicit rate we determine the present value of the lease liability using our incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date based on the lease term 

note 1 — business and significant accounting policies and note 7 — leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding the company’s leases and the adoption of asc 842 

revenue recognition — on january 1 2018 we adopted asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers  

our revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

• research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs are recognized when the leads are provided to vendors 

• conferences revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related conference or meeting 

• consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and materials engagements revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized as we work to satisfy our performance obligations revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered andor services are provided revenues related to contract optimization engagements are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment 

the majority of our research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time research contracts are generally noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the amount of a subscription contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

note 1 — business and significant accounting policies and note 9 — revenue and related matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding our revenues 

goodwill and other intangible assets — when we acquire a business we determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition which may include a significant amount of intangible assets such as customer relationships software and content as well as goodwill when determining the fair values of the acquired intangible assets we consider among other factors analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business the fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using an income approach that relies on discounted cash flows this method starts with a forecast of the expected future net cash flows for the asset and then adjusts the forecast to present value by applying a discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams we consider this approach to be the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of an acquired intangible asset is its ability to generate future income in a typical acquisition we engage a thirdparty valuation expert to assist us with the fair value analyses for acquired intangible assets 

determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets requires us to exercise significant judgment we select reasonable estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors including but not limited to marketplace participants consumer awareness and brand history additionally there are significant judgments inherent in discounted cash flows such as estimating the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the selection of discount rates hypothetical royalty rates and contributory asset capital charges specifically the selected discount rates are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the underlying acquired intangible assets 

determining an acquired intangible asset’s useful life also requires significant judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors including but not limited to the expected use of the asset historical client retention rates consumer awareness and trade name history as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an assets useful life 

the company’s goodwill is evaluated in accordance with fasb asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are current operating results that do not align with our annual plan or historical performance changes in our strategic plans or the use of our assets restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 

when performing our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events or circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than the related carrying amount if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than the related carrying amount then no quantitative impairment test is performed however if the results of our qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount then we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test 

evaluating the recoverability of goodwill requires judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of our estimates are subject to uncertainty among the factors that we consider in our qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment actual and projected reporting unit financial performance forwardlooking business measurements and external market assessments to determine the fair values of our reporting units for a quantitative analysis we typically utilize detailed financial projections which include significant variables such as projected rates of revenue growth profitability and cash flows as well as assumptions regarding discount rates the company’s weighted average cost of capital and other data 

our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill was a qualitative analysis conducted during the quarter ended september 30 2020 that indicated no impairment subsequent to completing our 2020 annual impairment test no events or changes in circumstances were noted that required an interim goodwill impairment test note 1 — business and significant accounting policies and note 3 — goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding the company’s goodwill and amortizable intangible assets 

accounting for income taxes — the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where the company operates this process involves estimating our current tax expense or benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this assessment we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized the company uses estimates in determining the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions significant judgment is required in evaluating tax law and measuring the benefits likely to be realized uncertain tax positions are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about their ultimate realization becomes available 

accounting for stockbased compensation — the company accounts for stockbased compensation awards in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 and no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period note 10 — stockbased compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding stockbased compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards requires the use of certain subjective assumptions including the expected life of a stockbased compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate periodic stockbased compensation expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stockbased compensation awards and the related periodic expense represent management’s best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if circumstances change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stockbased compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

a change in any of the terms or conditions of stockbased compensation awards is accounted for as a modification of the award incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess if any of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified measured based on the fair value of the awards at the modification date for vested awards we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs for unvested awards we recognize any incremental compensation expense at the modification date or ratably over the requisite remaining service period as appropriate if the fair value of the modified award is lower than the fair value of the original award immediately before modification the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the company’s outstanding debt obligations at december 31 2020 we had 7126 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 10 billion of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility under our 2020 credit agreement we believe that the company has adequate liquidity to meet its currently anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months as a cautionary measure we elected to suspend our share repurchase activity in march 2020 we resumed share repurchase activity in december 2020 

we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model in our research segment which is our largest business segment and historically has constituted a significant portion of our total revenues the majority of our research customer contracts are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow cash flow generation has also benefited from our ongoing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase sales 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world with 56 held overseas at december 31 2020 the company intends to reinvest substantially all of its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings except in instances where repatriation would result in minimal additional tax as a result of the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we believe that the income tax impact if such earnings were repatriated would be minimal

operating 

cash provided by operating activities was 9033 million and 5654 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to i higher pretax income in 2020 ii improved collections iii an increase in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities due to increased accrued payroll fringe benefits and customer deposits and iv reduced income tax payments offset by higher interest payments due to timing 

investing

quarterly financial data 

  

the tables below present our quarterly operating results for the twoyear period ended december 31 2020

recently issued accounting standards 

the fasb has issued accounting standards that had not yet become effective as of december 31 2020 and may impact the company’s consolidated financial statements or its disclosures in future periods note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides information regarding those accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

as of december 31 2020 the company had 20 billion in total debt principal outstanding note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the company’s outstanding debt obligations 

approximately 04 billion of the company’s total debt outstanding as of december 31 2020 was based on a floating base rate of interest which potentially exposes the company to increases in interest rates however we reduce our overall exposure to interest rate increases through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base interest rates on all of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rates 

foreign currency risk 

  

a significant portion of our revenues are typically derived from sales outside of the united states among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar as the values of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risk 

translation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars because the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 we had 7126 million of cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2020 could have increased or decreased by approximately 54 million the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings because movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar 

  

transaction risk arises when we enter into a transaction that is denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency a gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december 31 2020 had an immaterial net unrealized loss 

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents fees receivable interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks fees receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions and trends the following sections address significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky we urge you to consider carefully the factors described below and the risks that they present for our operations as well as the risks addressed in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k when the factors events and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this form 10k materialize there could be a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the united states and abroad in its recent report global economics prospects january 2020 slow growth policy challenges  the world bank reported that global trade and investment are expected to recover modestly this year but advanced economies are expected to slow the report also indicated that even if growth in emerging and developing economies occurs as anticipated the per capita growth is still expected to be less than longterm averages among the concerns cited were increasing and accelerated global debt accumulation slowdown in productivity price controls in emerging markets and developing economies risk of reescalating trade tensions and downturns in major economies in the united states the world bank notes that growth has decelerated in part due to lessening investment and exports and it is expected that general uncertainty and the diminishing impact of 2017 tax cuts will have a negative effect on growth in the near term a downturn in growth could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services in general in certain geographic regions in particular countries or industry sectors such difficulties could negatively impact our ability to maintain or improve the various business measurements we utilize which are defined in this annual report such as contract value and consulting backlog growth client retention wallet retention consulting utilization rates and the number of attendees and exhibitors at our conferences and other meetings failure to achieve acceptable levels of these measurements or improve them will negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so will result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we will not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends on our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information and advice that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our published data opinions or viewpoints prove to be wrong lack independence or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation will suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could materially adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our clients develop enhance and improve our existing products as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

technology is rapidly evolving and if we do not continue to develop new product and service offerings in response to these changes our business could suffer disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the environment in which we our clients and our competitors operate we will need to continue to respond to these changes by enhancing our product and service offerings to maintain our competitive position however we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhancing our products on a timely basis and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our clients our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new or enhanced existing offerings that address the changing needs of this constantly evolving marketplace failure to develop products that meet the needs of our clients in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

our research business depends on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services will lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted approximately 73 and 72 of total revenues from our ongoing operations for 2019 and 2018  respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often timeconsuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription contracts are typically for twelve months or longer our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 82 and 83 at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

the profitability and success of our conferences and other meetings are subject to external factors beyond our control our conferences business constituted approximately 11 of total revenues from our ongoing operations in both 2019 and 2018  the market for desirable dates and locations for our activities is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences their profitability will suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our conferences are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these activities can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as the occurrence of or concerns related to labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks war weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the conference or meeting we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major activities 

our consulting business depends on nonrecurring engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted approximately 9 of total revenues from our ongoing operations in both 2019 and 2018  consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring in addition revenue from our contract optimization business can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not predictable our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

a material decline in our ability to replace consulting engagements will have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and some may be terminated early we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the united states government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2019 and 2018  approximately 639 million and 555 million  respectively of our outstanding revenue contracts were attributable to government entities our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms certain of these contracts may be terminated at any time by the government entity without cause or penalty “termination for convenience” in addition contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures and compliance requirements as well as intense competition while terminations by governments have not been significant historically should appropriations for the various governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of revenues 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services and our future growth plans our success is based on attracting and retaining talented employees and we depend heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive maintaining our brand and reputation is important to our ability to recruit and retain employees we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts we may also be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws and changes to policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent could inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development and other efforts an inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel could materially adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as our future business and operating results in addition effective succession planning is important to our longterm success and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our “gartner” brand in particular our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and top talent and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may also discover that our brand though recognized is not perceived to be relevant by new market segments we have targeted we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need 

to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote maintain and protect the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 

we are subject to risks from operating globally we have clients in more than 100 countries and a substantial amount of our revenue is earned outside of the united states our operating results are subject to all of the risks typically inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous and complex foreign laws and regulations currency restrictions and fluctuations the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights including against economic espionage in international jurisdictions further we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

tariffs trade barriers and restrictions and other acts by governments to protect domestic markets or to retaliate against the trade tariffs and restrictions of other nations could negatively affect our business operations in addition the withdrawal of nations from existing common markets or trading blocs such as the exit of the united kingdom from the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit could be disruptive and negatively impact our business and the business of our clients we continue to monitor brexit and its potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition but its specific effects on our operations depend in part on what agreements are negotiated between the united kingdom and the eu regarding postbrexit access to eu markets if brexit leads to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and eu then we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the united kingdom may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to the divergent regulatory frameworks for example if brexit requires us to change our legal entity structure in the united kingdom and the eu our contractual commitments in the united kingdom and the rest of the eu may be impacted additionally separation from the eu may negatively impact the united kingdom economy result in the imposition of tariffs on us or result in currency devaluations in the united kingdom the impact of any of these effects of brexit among others could materially harm our business and financial results 

our failure to comply with complex us and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition our business and operations may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy it is our policy to comply and to require our local partners distributors agents and those with whom we do business to comply with all applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will comply with the company’s policies that mandate compliance with these laws any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of these laws even if inadvertent could be costly and disrupt our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows as well as on our reputation for example during the second half of 2018 we cooperated fully with a south african government commission established to review a wide range of issues related to the country’s revenue service including the procurement and fulfillment of consulting agreements we entered into with the revenue service through a sales agent from late 2014 through early 2017 with respect to gartner the commission recommended that the revenue service explore lawful options to invalidate the agreements in whole or in part and attempt to recover certain payments it made to us we are in ongoing discussions with the revenue service regarding the matter in parallel with our cooperation in south africa we commenced an internal investigation regarding this matter and voluntarily disclosed to the sec and department of justice doj in november 2018 that the commission was reviewing our procurement of these agreements we are cooperating fully with the sec and doj inquiries into this matter at this time we do not believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material effect on our financial results however an unexpected adverse resolution of these matters could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates from our international operations a significant portion of our revenues are typically derived from sales outside of the united states revenues earned outside the united states are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

natural disasters pandemics terrorist acts war actions by governments and other geopolitical activities could disrupt our operations we operate in numerous us and international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe the occurrence of or concerns related to a major weather event earthquake flood drought volcanic activity disease or pandemic or other natural disaster could significantly disrupt our operations in addition acts of civil unrest failure of critical 

infrastructure terrorism armed conflict war and abrupt political change as well as responses by various governments and the international community to such acts can have a negative effect on our business such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt or shut down the internet or other critical clientfacing and business processes impede the travel of our personnel and clients dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel and in general harm our ability to conduct normal business operations any of which can negatively impact our financial condition and operating results such events could also impact the timing and budget decisions of our clients which could materially adversely affect our business 

privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our conferences concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to damage our reputation and deter current and prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our conferences in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including conference attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects while we believe our overall data privacy procedures are adequate the theft or loss of such data or concerns about our practices even if unfounded with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data protection related matters could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our operating results any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users’ personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our conferences as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business 

in addition continuously evolving data protection laws and regulations such as the european union general data protection regulation gdpr and the new california consumer privacy act ccpa effective january 2020 pose increasingly complex compliance challenges we have implemented gdpr and ccpa compliance programs in the meantime gartner will continue to maintain and rely upon our comprehensive global data protection compliance program which includes administrative technical and physical controls to safeguard our associates’ and clients personal data the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states the eu and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to our business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in our computer systems and networks and in those of our thirdparty vendors individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers the cybersecurity risks we face range from cyber attacks common to most industries such as the development and deployment of malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions to more advanced threats that target us because of our prominence in the a global research and advisory field 

like many multinational corporations we and some third parties upon which we rely have experienced cyber attacks on our computer systems and networks in the past and may experience them in the future likely with more frequency and sophistication and involving a broader range of devices and modes of attack all of which will increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business operations products services or customers we have implemented various security controls to both meet our security compliance obligations while also defending against constantly evolving security threats our security controls help to secure our information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers are vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyber attacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events additionally the security compliance landscape continues to evolve requiring us to stay apprised of changes in cybersecurity laws regulations and security requirements required by our clients such as gdpr ccpa international organization for standardization iso and national institute of standards and technology nist recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber attacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers 

a cyber attack widespread internet failure or internet access limitations or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions additionally any material breaches of cybersecurity or other technologyrelated catastrophe or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred 

could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard our customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 

any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts for access to data centers and equipment and to move more of our workload into cloud services to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results 

our outstanding debt obligations could negatively impact our financial condition and future operating results as of december 31 2019  the company had outstanding debt of 14 billion under its 2016 term loan and revolving credit facility as amended the 2016 credit agreement and 8000 million of senior notes due 2025 the senior notes additional information regarding the 2016 credit agreement and the senior notes is included in note 6  debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the debt service requirements of these borrowings could impair our future financial condition and operating results in addition the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2016 credit agreement as well as the covenants related to the senior notes could limit our future financial flexibility a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding which could materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders and noteholders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those currently in place the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

in addition variablerate borrowings under our 2016 credit agreement typically use libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest libor is the subject of recent national and international regulatory scrutiny which may result in changes that cause libor to disappear entirely after 2021 or to cause it to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these libor developments on our variablerate borrowings including the possible transition to other rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr cannot be predicted at this time but could include an increase in the cost of our variablerate indebtedness and volatility in our earnings 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

our employees are subject to restrictive covenant agreements which include restrictions on employees ability to compete and solicit customers and employees and assignment of invention agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the period expires relating to their particular restrictions former employees may compete against us if a former employee violates the provisions of hisher restrictive covenant agreement we seek to enforce the restrictions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company increase revenue or fully realize anticipated synergies the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

we face risks related to leased office space we assumed a significant amount of leased office space in particular in arlington virginia in connection with the acquisition of ceb inc in 2017 in arlington we have consolidated all our businesses into a single building and have sublet substantially all of the excess space in our other properties through our real estate consolidations and other related activities we have tried to secure quality subtenants with appropriate sublease terms however if subtenants default on their sublease obligations with us or otherwise terminate their subleases with us we may experience a loss of planned sublease rental income which could result in a material charge against our operating results 

we are also in the process of adding new leased spaces to support our continued growth if the new spaces are not completed on schedule or if the landlord defaults on its commitments and obligations pursuant to the new leases we may incur additional expenses in addition unanticipated difficulties in initiating operations in a new space including construction delays it system interruptions or other infrastructure support problems could result in a delay in moving into the new space resulting in a loss of employee and operational productivity and a loss of revenue andor additional expenses which could also have an adverse material impact on our operating results 

we face risks related to litigation we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits of any claim and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim claims can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us that we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation  we are a global company and a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the united states and taxed at rates less than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many countries tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions where we do business the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the act adopted broad us corporate income tax reform and introduced several highly complex provisions the us treasury department and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret and issue guidance on how provisions of the act will be applied and administered we will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of the act in future financial statements as appropriate 

during 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released final reports on various action items associated with its initiative to prevent base erosion and profit shifting beps numerous countries have and continue to propose tax law changes intended to address beps the future enactment by various governments of these and other proposals could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by various tax authorities recent and future actions on the part of the oecd and various governments have increased scrutiny of our tax filings although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions 

and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 1420 million of accumulated undistributed earnings in our nonus subsidiaries our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2019  92 of our cash and cash equivalents was held overseas with a substantial portion representing accumulated undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings is required if the company intends to reinvest such earnings overseas indefinitely the provisions of the act significantly changed the way earnings of nonus subsidiaries are taxed in the united states the act imposed a onetime transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred adopted a system of current taxation of foreign global intangible lowtaxed income and provided for a deduction on repatriation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries as a result of and subsequent to the enactment of the act the company has remitted previously undistributed earnings with minimal additional tax cost the company intends to continue to reinvest its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings except in instances where the repatriation of those earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result we have not recognized income tax expense on the amounts deemed permanently reinvested 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations accordingly we have a corporate compliance program that includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however failure of any employee fails to comply with any of these laws regulations or our policies could result in a range of liabilities for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

risks related to our common stock 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period andor the financial guidance we have given may not meet the expectations of investors which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of our conferences the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in our industry the impact of our acquisitions and general economic conditions an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have previously provided if this occurs the price of our common stock could decline 

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions geopolitical events changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control including any and all factors that move the securities markets generally these factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales or issuances of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock the issuance of additional shares of our common stock could also lower the market price of our common stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market we have a boardapproved share repurchase program and at december 31 2019  approximately 7155 million remained available for share purchases under this program no assurance can be given that we will continue these share repurchase activities in the future after the current program is completed or in the event that the price of our common stock reaches levels at which repurchases are not accretive 

future sales of our common stock from grants and awards could lower our stock price as of december 31 2019  the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under our equity incentive plans was approximately 26 million shares approximately 06 million of which have vested in addition at the present time approximately 45 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable and have been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act which are subject to certain limitations we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with our interests or the interests of other stockholders  to our knowledge as of the date hereof and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings five institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock ii advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings and iii the antitakeover provisions of delaware law these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such they may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods 

our critical accounting policies are described below 

accounting for leases — on january 1 2019 the company adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update no 201602 leases as amended asu no 201602 or the “new lease standard” which substantively modifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for lease arrangements prior to the issuance of asu no 201602 generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america under fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 840 leases provided that lease arrangements meeting certain criteria were not recorded on an entitys balance sheet asu no 201602 significantly changes the accounting for leases because a rightofuse model is now used whereby a lessee must record a rightofuse asset and a related lease liability on its balance sheet for most of its leases under asu no 201602 leases are classified as either operating or finance arrangements with such classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in an entitys income statement asu no 201602 also requires significantly expanded disclosures to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows related to leases 

the company adopted asu no 201602 using a modified retrospective approach we elected to use an optional transition method available under asu no 201602 to record the required cumulative effect adjustments to the opening balance sheet in the period of adoption rather than in the earliest comparative period presented as such the companys historical consolidated financial statements have not been restated certain permitted practical expedients were used by the company upon adoption of the new lease standard including i combining lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for purposes of the recognition and measurement requirements under asu no 201602 ii not reassessing a lease arrangement to determine if its classification should be changed under asu no 201602 and iii not reassessing initial direct costs for leases that were in existence on the date of adoption 

the adoption of asu no 201602 on january 1 2019 had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet because the rightofuse model significantly increased both our assets and liabilities from our lease arrangements all of which were operating leases that were not previously recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets the adoption of the new lease standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease liabilities aggregating 8513 million based on the present value of the company’s remaining minimum lease payments while the corresponding rightofuse assets totaled 6519 million additionally the company’s adoption of asu no 201602 resulted in a net increase of 6387 million in each of the company’s total assets and total liabilities however there was no effect on the company’s total stockholders’ equity the company’s consolidated statements of operations and its cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2019 were not materially impacted by the adoption of the new lease standard note 1 — business and significant accounting policies and note 7 — leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding the companys leases and the adoption of asu no 201602 

revenue recognition — for 2019 and 2018 revenue was recognized in accordance with the requirements of accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers as amended asu no 201409 prior to january 1 2018 the company recognized revenue in accordance with thenexisting generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition  collectively “prior gaap” under both asu no 201409 and prior gaap revenue can only be recognized when all of the required criteria for revenue recognition have been met although there were certain changes to the company’s revenue recognition policies and procedures with the adoption of asu no 201409 on january 1 2018 there were no material differences between the pattern and timing of revenue recognition under asu no 201409 and prior gaap 

our revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

 

 

 

the majority of our research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time research contracts are generally noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the amount of a subscription contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

note 1 — business and significant accounting policies and note 9 — revenue and related matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding our revenues and the adoption of asu no 201409 on january 1 2018 

uncollectible fees receivable — the company maintains an allowance for losses of uncollectible receivables that is classified in our consolidated balance sheets as an offset to the gross amount of fees receivable increases and decreases to the allowance are recognized in earnings 

the determination of the amount of the allowance is based on historical loss experience an assessment of current economic conditions the aging of outstanding receivables the financial health of specific clients and probable losses this evaluation is 

inherently judgmental and requires the use of estimates the allowance is periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause the allowance to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

the table below presents our gross fees receivable and the related allowance for losses as of the dates indicated in thousands 



goodwill and other intangible assets — when we acquire a business we determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition which may include a significant amount of intangible assets such as customer relationships software and content as well as goodwill when determining the fair values of the acquired intangible assets we consider among other factors analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business the fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using an income approach that relies on discounted cash flows this method starts with a forecast of the expected future net cash flows for the asset and then adjusts the forecast to present value by applying a discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams we consider this approach to be the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of an acquired intangible asset is its ability to generate future income in a typical acquisition we engage a thirdparty valuation expert to assist us with the fair value analyses for acquired intangible assets 

determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets requires us to exercise significant judgment we select reasonable estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors including but not limited to marketplace participants consumer awareness and brand history additionally there are significant judgments inherent in discounted cash flows such as estimating the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the selection of discount rates hypothetical royalty rates and contributory asset capital charges specifically the selected discount rates are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the underlying acquired intangible assets 

determining an acquired intangible assets useful life also requires significant judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors including but not limited to the expected use of the asset historical client retention rates consumer awareness and trade name history as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an assets useful life 

the companys goodwill is evaluated in accordance with fasb asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are current operating results that do not align with our annual plan or historical performance changes in our strategic plans or the use of our assets restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 

when performing our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events or circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than the related carrying amount if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than the related carrying amount then no quantitative impairment test is performed however if the results of our qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount then we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test 

evaluating the recoverability of goodwill requires judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of our estimates are subject to uncertainty among the factors that we consider in our qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment actual and projected reporting unit financial performance forwardlooking business measurements and external market assessments to determine the fair values of our reporting units for a quantitative analysis we typically utilize detailed financial projections which include significant variables such as projected rates of revenue growth profitability and cash flows as well as assumptions regarding discount rates the companys weighted average cost of capital and other data 

our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill was a qualitative analysis conducted during the quarter ended september 30 2019 that indicated no impairment subsequent to completing our 2019 annual impairment test no events or changes in circumstances were noted that required an interim goodwill impairment test note 1 — business and significant accounting policies and note 3 — goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding the companys goodwill and amortizable intangible assets 

accounting for income taxes — the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where the company operates this process involves estimating our current tax expense or benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this assessment we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized the company uses estimates in determining the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions significant judgment is required in evaluating tax law and measuring the benefits likely to be realized uncertain tax positions are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about their ultimate realization becomes available 

accounting for stockbased compensation — the company accounts for stockbased compensation awards in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 and no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period note 10 — stockbased compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding stockbased compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards requires the use of certain subjective assumptions including the expected life of a stockbased compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate periodic stockbased compensation expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stockbased compensation awards and the related periodic expense represent management’s best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if circumstances change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stockbased compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

restructuring and other accruals — we may record accruals for severance costs contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce future operating costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future payments under contractual arrangements the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent that actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year 

results of operations 

consolidated results 

the table below presents an analysis of selected line items and yearoveryear changes in our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated in thousands 



  

total revenues for 2019 were 42 billion  an increase of 2699 million  or 7 compared to 2018 on a reported basis and 9 excluding the foreign currency impact the tables below present i revenues by geographic region based on where the sale is fulfilled and ii revenues by segment for the years indicated in thousands 







 

refer to the section of this mda below entitled “segment results” for a discussion of revenues and results by segment 

cost of services and product development was 16 billion in 2019  an increase of 818 million compared to 2018  or 6 on a reported basis and 7 excluding the foreign currency impact the increase in cost of services and product development was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs resulting from increased headcount partially offset by a reduction in expense from certain businesses that were divested during 2018 cost of services and product development as a percent of revenues was 37 during both 2019 and 2018  

selling general and administrative “sga” expense was 21 billion in 2019  an increase of 2193 million compared to 2018  or 12 on a reported basis and 14 excluding the foreign currency impact the increase in sga expense was primarily due to i higher commissions from increased sales bookings ii more payroll and related benefits costs which were driven mostly by increased headcount and iii higher facilities and corporate costs these items were partially offset by a reduction in sga expense from certain businesses that were divested during 2018 and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses during 2019  the overall headcount growth included quotabearing sales associate increases in global technology sales and global business sales to 3267 and 869  respectively at december 31 2019  on a combined basis the total number of quotabearing sales associates increased by 6 when compared to december 31 2018  sga expense as a percent of revenues was 50 and 47 during 2019 and 2018  respectively sga expense increased at a faster pace than our revenue in 2019 as we grew sales capacity and the enabling infrastructure during the year to promote future revenue growth 

depreciation increased by 20 during 2019 compared to 2018  this increase was due to additional investments including new leasehold improvements as additional office space went into service and capitalized software 

amortization of intangibles decreased by 31 during 2019 compared to 2018 due to certain businesses that were divested during 2018  including the related intangible assets as well as certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in 2018 and 2019  

acquisition and integration charges declined by 977 million during 2019 compared to 2018  this decrease was the result of the company having completed two acquisitions in 2017 no acquisitions in 2018 and one minor acquisition in late 2019  

operating income was 3701 million and 2597 million during 2019 and 2018  respectively the increase in operating income reflects several factors including i reduced amortization of intangibles and acquisition and integration charges and ii higher segment contributions primarily in our research and conferences segments and to a lesser extent consulting which were partially offset by higher sga expense and depreciation 

interest expense net declined by 244 million during 2019 compared to 2018  this decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings during 2019 and nominally lower weighted average annual effective interest rates on the companys total outstanding debt 

gain from divested operations of 454 million in 2018 was due to sales of certain business units and other miscellaneous assets loss from divested operations of 21 million in 2019 was primarily due to adjustments of certain working capital balances related to the companys 2018 divestitures note 2 — acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the companys 2018 divestitures 

other income net for the years presented herein included the net impact of foreign currency gains and losses from our hedging activities as well as sales of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives during 2019  other income net also included a pretax gain of 91 million from the companys sale a minority equity investment 

the provision for income taxes was 424 million and 587 million during 2019 and 2018  respectively with an effective income tax rate of 154 in 2019 and 324 in 2018  the 2019 effective tax rate includes a significant benefit from the intercompany sale of certain intellectual property while no such benefit occurred in 2018  note 12 — income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the companys income taxes 

net income was 2333 million and 1225 million during 2019 and 2018  respectively additionally our diluted net income per share increased by 123 in 2019 compared to 2018  these yearoveryear changes reflect i increases in our 2019 operating income ii lower interest expense and iii a lower effective income tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018  partially offsetting these items was a loss from divested operations during 2019 compared to a corresponding gain during 2018  

segment results 

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income or loss excluding certain cost of services and product development expenses sga expenses depreciation amortization of intangibles and acquisition and integration charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percent of revenues 

2018 business divestitures 

during 2018 the company divested all of the noncore businesses that comprised its other segment and moved a small residual product from the other segment into the research business and as a result no operating activity has been recorded in the other segment in 2019 the other segment had 1056 million of revenue during 2018  while gross contribution was 651 million  note 2 — acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the companys 2018 divestitures 

reportable segments

the sections below present the results of the companys three reportable business segments 

research 







research revenues increased by 2688 million during 2019 compared to 2018  or 9 on a reported basis and 10 excluding the foreign currency impact the gross contribution margin was 70 in 2019 compared to 69 in 2018  the increase in revenues during 2019 was primarily due to the same factors driving the trend in our research contract value which are discussed below the improvement in margin was primarily due to strong fourth quarter results in 2019 wherein program costs and travel and entertainment expenses grew at a slower pace than the corresponding quarterly revenue 

total contract value increased to 34 billion at december 31 2019  or 12 compared to december 31 2018 on a foreign exchange neutral basis total contract value at december 31 2019 increased by doubledigits across more than half of the company’s client sizes and half of its industry segments when compared to december 31 2018  global technology sales gts contract value increased by 12 at december 31 2019 when compared to december 31 2018  the increase in gts contract value was primarily due to additional sales headcount and productivity improvements global business sales gbs contract value increased by 9 yearoveryear 8 on a foreign exchange neutral basis after excluding the effects of the companys 2019 acquisition of topo research llc primarily driven by the combined effect of improved retention and new business with a large portion of the new business coming from newly launched products 

gts client retention was 82 and 83 as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively while wallet retention was 104 and 105  respectively gbs client retention was 82 as of both december 31 2019 and 2018  while wallet retention was 101 and 95  respectively the increase in gbs wallet retention was largely due to increased spending by retained clients the number of gts client enterprises increased by 1 at december 31 2019 when compared to december 31 2018  while gbs client enterprises declined by 6  

conferences 





 

conferences revenues increased by 664 million during 2019 compared to 2018  or 16 on a reported basis and 18 excluding the foreign currency impact revenues from both attendees and exhibitors at our destination conferences as well as revenues from our single day local meetings increased by doubledigits during 2019 compared to 2018  we held 72 destination conferences in 2019 with a 10 increase in the number of attendees and a 15 increase in exhibitors when compared to 2018  while the average revenue per attendee and exhibitor both increased by 3  the segment gross contribution margin was 51 and 50 in 2019 and 2018  respectively the higher gross contribution margin during 2019 was primarily due to improvements in our average revenue per attendee and exhibitor improved margins from our single day local meetings and our continuing efforts to efficiently manage our conferencerelated expenses partially offsetting these items were higher costs associated with increased headcount 

consulting 





 

consulting revenues increased 11 during 2019 compared to 2018 on a reported basis and 14 excluding the foreign currency impact with revenue improvements in laborbased core consulting and contract optimization of 7 and 31  respectively on a reported basis contract optimization revenue may vary significantly and as such 2019 revenues may not be indicative of future results the segment gross contribution margin was 30 and 29 in 2019 and 2018  respectively the higher gross contribution margin during 2019 was primarily due to the increase in contract optimization revenue which has a higher contribution margin than our laborbased core consulting billing rate increases improvements in our laborbased consulting margins and benefits derived from certain costreduction initiatives partially offset by increased personnel costs and commissions 

backlog increased by 73 million  or 7  from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019  the 1157 million of backlog at december 31 2019 represented approximately four months of backlog which is in line with the companys operational target 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the companys outstanding debt obligations at december 31 2019  we had 2808 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 10 billion of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility under our 2016 credit agreement we believe that the company has adequate liquidity to meet its currently anticipated needs 

we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model in our research segment which is our largest business segment and historically has constituted a significant portion of our total revenues the majority of our research customer contracts are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow cash flow generation has also benefited from our ongoing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase sales 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world with 92 held overseas at december 31 2019  the company intends to reinvest substantially all of its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings except in instances where repatriation would result in minimal additional tax as a result of the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we believe that the income tax impact if such earnings were repatriated would be minimal 

the table below summarizes the changes in the companys cash balances for the years indicated in thousands 





operating 

cash provided by operating activities was 5654 million and 4712 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to i greater profitability in 2019  including lower cash payments for both acquisitionrelated costs and interest on our borrowings and ii improved collections of our fees receivable during 2019  partially offsetting these items were higher payments for income taxes net of refunds received during 2019  

investing 

cash used in investing activities was 1609 million in 2019 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 3841 million in 2018  the cash used in 2019 was primarily for capital expenditures and the acquisition of topo research llc partially offset by 141 million of cash proceeds from the sale of a minority equity investment during 2018  5268 million of net cash was realized from business unit divestitures and other miscellaneous asset sales partially offset by payments of 1269 million for capital expenditures and 159 million for deferred consideration from a pre2018 acquisition 

financing 

cash used in financing activities was 2860 million in 2019 compared to cash used of 13 billion in 2018  during 2019 the company borrowed 50 million under a financial program offered by the state of connecticut and repaid 1096 million of other borrowings we also used 1990 million of cash during 2019 for share repurchases during 2018  the company paid 10 billion in debt principal repayments and 2608 million for share repurchases 

obligations and commitments 

debt 

as of december 31 2019  the company had 22 billion of principal amount of debt outstanding note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the companys outstanding debt obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

through december 31 2019  the company has not entered into any material offbalance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons 

contractual cash commitments 

the table below summarizes the companys future contractual cash commitments as of december 31 2019 in thousands 





 

in addition to the contractual cash commitments included in the above table the company has other payables and liabilities that may be legally enforceable but are not considered contractual commitments information regarding the companys payables and liabilities is included in note 5 — accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

quarterly financial data 

  

the tables below present our quarterly operating results for the twoyear period ended december 31 2019  





  

 

recently issued accounting standards 

the fasb has issued accounting standards that had not yet become effective as of december 31 2019 and may impact the company’s consolidated financial statements or its disclosures in future periods note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides information regarding those accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

as of december 31 2019  the company had 22 billion in total debt principal outstanding note 6 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the companys outstanding debt obligations 

approximately 14 billion of the companys total debt outstanding as of december 31 2019 was based on a floating base rate of interest which potentially exposes the company to increases in interest rates however we reduce our overall exposure to interest rate increases through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base interest rates on the borrowings to fixed rates thus we are only exposed to base interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings in excess of any amounts that are not hedged at december 31 2019  the company was effectively fully hedged against the base interest rate risk on its floating rate borrowings 

foreign currency risk 

  

a significant portion of our revenues are typically derived from sales outside of the united states among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian 

dollar the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar as the values of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risk 

translation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars because the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019  we had 2808 million of cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2019 could have increased or decreased by approximately 260 million  the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings because movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar 

  

transaction risk arises when we enter into a transaction that is denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency a gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december 31 2019 had an immaterial net unrealized gain 

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents fees receivable interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks fees receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions and trends the following sections discuss many but not all of the various risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our   business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could   therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may   also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

risks related to our business 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic   conditions  our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the united states and abroad in its recent report global economics prospects  january 2019 darkening skies  the world bank reported that global trade and investment have weakened and it reduced its growth outlook for both 2018 and 2019 among the concerns cited were trade disputes higher interest rates and lower liquidity as advancedeconomy central banks continue to withdraw accommodative monetary policies high corporate debt loads and volatile financial markets in the us where growth has remained solid the world bank also cited concerns regarding the diminishing impact of the 2017 tax cuts and a volatile political environment a downturn in growth could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products 

and services in general in certain geographic regions in particular countries or industry sectors such difficulties could negatively impact our ability to maintain or improve the various business measurements we utilize which are defined in this annual report such as contract value and consulting backlog growth client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates and the number of attendees and exhibitors to our conferences and other meetings failure to achieve acceptable levels of these measurements or improve them could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could   materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services  we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information and advice that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our published data opinions or viewpoints prove to be wrong lack independence or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could materially adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services   or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain   competitive  the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations develop enhance and improve our existing as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

technology is rapidly evolving and if we do not continue to develop new product and service offerings in response to these changes our business could suffer disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the environment in which we our clients and our competitors operate we will need to continue to respond to these changes by enhancing our product and service offerings in order to maintain our competitive position however we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhance our products on a timely basis and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our clients our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new or enhanced existing offerings that address the changing needs of this constantly evolving marketplace failure to develop products that meet the needs of our clients in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

our research business depends on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new   subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our   failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services   could lead to a decrease in our revenues  a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted approximately 80 and 79 of total revenues from our ongoing operations for 2018 and 2017 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription contracts are typically for 12months or longer our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 83 at both december 31 2018 and 2017 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

the profitability and success of our conferences and other meetings could be   adversely affected by external factors beyond our control  our conferences business constituted approximately 11 of total revenues from our ongoing operations in both 2018 and 2017 the market for desirable dates and locations for our activities is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our conferences are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these activities can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks war weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the activity we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major activities 

our consulting business depends on nonrecurring engagements and our failure to secure new   engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues  consulting segment revenues constituted approximately 9 and 10 of total revenues from our ongoing operations in 2018 and 2017 respectively consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting engagements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition in addition revenue from our contract optimization business can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not predictable 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated  we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the united states government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2018 and 2017 approximately 5550 million and 4350 million respectively of our revenue contracts were attributable to government entities our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time by the government entity without cause or penalty “termination for convenience” in addition contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures and compliance requirements as well as intense competition while terminations by governments have not been significant historically should appropriations for the various governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of revenues 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could   jeopardize the quality of our products and services and our future growth plans our success is based on attracting and retaining talented employees and we depend heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive maintaining our brand and reputation are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a 

greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts we may also be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws and changes to policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent could inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development and other efforts an inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel could materially adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as our future business and operating results in addition effective succession planning is important to our longterm success and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name  we believe that our “gartner” brand in particular our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and top talent and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may also discover that our brand though recognized is not perceived to be relevant by new market segments we have targeted we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote maintain and protect the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational and other risks which   could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have clients in more than 100 countries and a substantial amount of our revenue is earned outside of the united states our operating results are subject to all of the risks typically inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous and complex foreign laws and regulations currency restrictions and fluctuations the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights or against economic espionage in international jurisdictions 

our business could also be negatively impacted by tariffs trade barriers and restrictions and other acts by governments to protect domestic markets or to retaliate against the trade tariffs and restrictions of other nations in addition the withdrawal of nations from existing common markets or trading blocs such as the possible exit of the united kingdom from the european union eu commonly referred to as brexit could be potentially disruptive and could negatively impact our business and our clients brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and eu we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the united kingdom may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the eu and as a result our contractual commitments in the united kingdom and the rest of the eu may be impacted which could negatively affect our operations in europe this and other brexitrelated issues may require changes to our legal entity structure in the united kingdom and the eu any of these effects of brexit among others could harm our business and financial results 

we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

our business and operations may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy it is our policy to comply and to require our local partners distributors agents and those with whom we do business to comply with all applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents will comply with the company’s policies that mandate compliance with these laws any failure to comply with these laws even if inadvertent could be costly and disrupt our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows as well as on our reputation for example during the second half of 2018 we cooperated fully with a south african government commission established to review a wide range of issues related to the country’s revenue service including the procurement and fulfillment of consulting agreements we entered into with the revenue service through a sales agent from late 2014 through early 2017 with respect to gartner the commission recommended that the revenue service explore lawful options to invalidate the agreements in whole or in part and attempt to recover certain payments it made to us in parallel with our cooperation in south africa we commenced an internal investigation regarding this matter and voluntarily disclosed to the sec and department of justice “doj” in november 2018 that the commission was reviewing our procurement of these agreements we intend to fully cooperate with any sec or doj inquiries into this matter at this time we do not believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material effect on our financial results however an unexpected adverse resolution of these matters could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are exposed to volatility in foreign currency   exchange rates from our international operations  a significant portion of our revenues are typically derived from sales outside of the united states revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations additionally our effective tax rate is increased as the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies which could impact our operating results 

natural disasters terrorist acts war actions by governments and other geopolitical activities could disrupt our operations we operate in numerous us and international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe a major weather event earthquake flood drought volcanic activity disease or other natural disaster could significantly disrupt our operations in addition acts of civil unrest failure of critical infrastructure terrorism armed conflict war and abrupt political change as well as responses by various governments and the international community to such acts can have a negative effect on our business such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt or shut down the internet or other critical clientfacing and business processes impede the travel of our personnel and clients dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel and in general harm our ability to conduct normal business operations any of which can negatively impact our financial condition and operating results such events could also impact the timing and budget decisions of our clients which could materially adversely affect our business 

privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our conferences  concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to   damage our reputation and deter current and prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our conferences in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including conference attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects while we believe our overall data privacy procedures are adequate the theft or loss of such data or concerns about our practices even if unfounded with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data protection related matters could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our operating results any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users’ personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our conferences as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business 

in addition continuously evolving data protection laws and regulations such as the european union general data protection regulation “gdpr” effective in may 2018 and the new california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which takes effect in january 2020 pose increasingly complex compliance challenges we have implemented a gdpr compliance program and are working towards ccpa compliance in the meantime gartner will continue to maintain and rely upon our comprehensive global data protection compliance program which includes administrative technical and physical controls to safeguard our associates’ and clients personal data the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states the european union and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business  a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems to conduct our operations individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers they may develop and deploy malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions these threats are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them a cyberattack widespread internet failure or internet access limitations or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial results 

we take steps to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines 

in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation regulatory action and scrutiny or other costs as a result of these occurrences 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to   maintain an adequate operations infrastructure  our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to move more of our workload into cloud services to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results 

our outstanding debt obligations could negatively impact our financial condition and future operating results   as of december 31 2018 the company had outstanding debt of 15 billion under its 2016 term loan and revolving credit facility as amended the 2016 credit agreement and 8000 million of senior notes due 2025 senior notes additional information regarding the 2016 credit agreement and the senior notes is included in note 5 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

the debt service requirements of these borrowings could impair our future financial condition and operating results in addition the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2016 credit agreement as amended as well as the covenants related to the senior notes could limit our future financial flexibility a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding which could materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders and noteholders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those currently the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

in addition variable rate borrowings under our 2016 credit agreement typically use libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest libor is the subject of recent national and international regulatory scrutiny which may result in changes that cause libor to disappear entirely after 2021 or to cause it to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these libor developments on our variable rate borrowings including the possible transition to other rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr cannot be predicted at this time but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness and volatility in our earnings 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on   favorable terms or at all  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our   competitive position may be harmed  we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

our employees are subject to restrictive covenant agreements which include restrictions on employees ability to compete and solicit customers and employees and assignment of invention agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the period expires relating to the particular restriction former employees may compete against us if a former employee violates the provisions of hisher restrictive covenant agreement we seek to enforce the restrictions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic   investments which could involve substantial risks  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company and increase sales the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

we face risks related to leased office space  with the 2017 ceb acquisition we assumed a significant amount of additional leased office space in particular in arlington virginia which formerly served as cebs headquarters location we have largely completed all the office space consolidations necessitated by the ceb acquisition as well as the divestiture of certain former ceb businesses that we completed during 2018 in arlington we have consolidated all our businesses into a single new building and have substantially sublet the excess space in all of our other properties similarly in chicago we have also consolidated into a single new office space consolidating four different legacy spaces through all the consolidations we have tried to secure quality subtenants with appropriate sublease terms however if subtenants default on their sublease obligation with us or otherwise terminate the subleases with us we may experience a loss of planned sublease rental income which could result in a material charge against our operating results 

we are also in the process of adding new leased spaces to support our continued growth if the new spaces are not completed on schedule or if the landlord defaults on its commitments and obligations pursuant to the new leases we may incur additional expenses in addition unanticipated difficulties in initiating operations in a new space including construction delays it system interruptions or other infrastructure support problems could result in a delay in moving into the new space resulting in a loss of employee and operational productivity and a loss of revenue andor additional expenses which could also have an adverse material impact on our operating results 

we face risks related to litigation  we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us which we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation  we are a global company and a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the united states and taxed at rates less than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities 

at the present time the united states and other countries where we do business have either changed or are actively considering changes in their tax accounting and other related laws in the united states tax reform has introduced numerous new complicated tax laws which could unfavorably impact our future effective tax rate various provisions of the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the act are highly complex and remain unclear in certain respects additional guidance in the form of notices and proposed regulations have been issued and further guidance is expected to be issued changes could be made to the proposed regulations future legislation could be enacted and more regulations and notices could be issued we will continue to monitor and will reflect impacts in future financial statements as appropriate in addition many state and local tax jurisdictions are still determining how they will interpret the act final state and local governments’ legislation or guidance relating to the act may impact our financial results 

during 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” released final reports on various action items associated with its initiative to prevent base erosion and profit shifting “beps” numerous countries have and continue to propose tax law changes intended to address beps the future enactment by various governments of these and other proposals could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by various tax authorities recent and future actions on the part of the oecd and various governments have increased scrutiny of our tax filings although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows particularly in major taxing jurisdictions including but not limited to the united states ireland india canada united kingdom japan and france 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 1710 million of accumulated undistributed earnings in our nonus subsidiaries our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2018 79 of our cash and cash equivalents was held overseas with a substantial portion representing accumulated undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under us gaap no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings is required if the company intends to reinvest such earnings overseas indefinitely our current liquidity requirements do not demonstrate a need to repatriate accumulated undistributed foreign earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our us operations accordingly the company intends to continue to reinvest substantially all of its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings except in instances in which the repatriation of those earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result we have not recognized income tax expense on the amounts deemed permanently reinvested however under the provisions of the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we envision that the income tax that would be payable if such earnings were repatriated would be minimal 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws regulations or our policies a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

risks related to our common stock 

  

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period andor the financial guidance we have given may not meet the   expectations of investors which may cause the price of our common stock to decline  our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of our conferences the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in our industry the impact of our acquisitions and general economic conditions an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have previously provided if this occurs the price of our common stock could decline 

  

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may   not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you   paid  the price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions geopolitical events changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control including any and all factors that move the securities markets generally these factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

future sales or issuances of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock   price  sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock the issuance of additional shares of our common stock could also lower the market price of our common stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market we have a boardapproved share repurchase program and at december 31 2018 approximately 8710 million remained available for share 

purchases under this program no assurance can be given that we will continue these share repurchase activities in the future when the program is completed or in the event that the price of our common stock reaches levels at which repurchases are not accretive 

future sales of our common stock from grants and awards could lower our stock   price  as of december 31 2018 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under our equity incentive plans was approximately 26 million shares approximately 05 million of which have vested in addition at the present time approximately 49 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable and have been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act which are subject to certain limitations we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours  to our knowledge as of the date hereof and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings five institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control   even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock ii advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings and iii the antitakeover provisions of delaware law these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such they may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods 

  

our critical accounting policies pertaining to the years presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are described below 

  

revenue recognition  — on january 1 2018 the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu no 201409 asu no 201409 and related amendments required changes in revenue recognition policies as well as enhanced disclosures among other things asu no 201409 requires a fivestep evaluative process that consists of 

1 identifying the contract with the customer 

2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 

3 determining the transaction price for the contract 

4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 

5 recognizing revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied 

the company adopted asu no 201409 on january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption under this method of adoption the cumulative effect of applying the new standard is recorded at the date of initial application with no restatement of the comparative prior periods presented the adoption of asu no 201409 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements however the adoption of the new standard required reclassifications of certain amounts presented in the company’s consolidated balance sheet prior to january 1 2018 the company recognized revenue in accordance with thenexisting generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “prior gaap” under both asu no 201409 and prior gaap revenue can only be recognized when all of the required criteria are met note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding our adoption of asu no 201409 and its impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

our revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

  

 

 

 

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time research contracts are generally noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the amount of a subscription contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

  

uncollectible fees receivable  — at december 31 2017 the company maintained an allowance for losses that was comprised of a bad debt allowance and a revenue reserve in connection with the adoption of asu no 201409 on january 1 2018 management concluded that the revenue reserve was a refund liability rather than a contrareceivable due to the nature of the account activity as a result the company reclassified the revenue reserve of 62 million on january 1 2018 from the allowance for losses to accounts payable and accrued liabilities and will consistently present the revenue reserve in this manner in all future consolidated balance sheets note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding our adoption of asu no 201409 and its impact on the companys allowance for losses increases and decreases in the allowance for losses are charged to earnings either to expense ie the bad debt allowance or revenues ie the revenue reserve 

the determination of the bad debt allowance is based on historical loss experience an assessment of current economic conditions the aging of outstanding receivables the financial health of specific clients and probable losses this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates the companys bad debt allowance is periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our bad debt allowance to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

the following table presents our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands 



 

goodwill and other intangible assets  — when we acquire a business we determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition which may include a significant amount of intangible assets such as customer relationships software and content as well as resulting goodwill when determining the fair values of the acquired intangible assets we consider among other factors analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business the fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using an income approach that relies on discounted cash flows this method starts with a forecast of the expected future net cash flows for the asset and then adjusts the forecast to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams we consider this approach to be the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of an acquired intangible asset is its ability to generate future income in a typical acquisition we engage a thirdparty valuation expert to assist us with the fair value analyses for acquired intangible assets 

determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets requires us to exercise significant judgment we select reasonable estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors including but not limited to marketplace participants consumer awareness and brand history additionally there are significant judgments inherent in discounted cash flows such as estimating the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the selection of appropriate discount rates hypothetical royalty rates and contributory asset capital charges specifically the selected discount rates are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the underlying acquired intangible assets 

determining an acquired intangible assets useful life also requires significant judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors including but not limited to the expected use of the asset historical client retention rates consumer awareness and trade name history as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an assets useful life 

the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are current operating results that do not align with our annual plan or historical performance changes in our strategic plan or the use of our assets restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 

fasb asc topic 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or a combination of the two approaches both methods utilize estimates which in turn require judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty if our goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we may recognize an impairment charge among the factors that we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment actual and projected reporting unit financial performance forwardlooking business measurements and external market assessments a quantitative analysis requires management to consider each of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections to include the rate of revenue growth profitability and cash flows as well as assumptions regarding discount rates the companys weighted average cost of capital and other data in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units 

we conducted a quantitative assessment of the fair value of all of the companys reporting units during the quarter ended september 30 2018 our assessment determined that the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values and as a result no goodwill impairment was indicated note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets 

accounting for income taxes  — the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense or benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets when assessing the

2018 versus 2017 

research revenues increased by 6345 million during 2018 compared to 2017 or 26 on a reported basis and 25 excluding the foreign currency impact higher revenues in 2018 were primarily driven by i a doubledigit increase in subscription revenues in 2018 a portion of which was due to the impact of the ceb acquisition as 2018 included a full year of revenue compared to nine months in 2017 and ii the negative impact on revenue in 2017 from the deferred revenue fair value accounting adjustment resulting from the ceb acquisition which had a significantly lesser impact in 2018 the gross contribution margin improved by two points in 2018 primarily due to i a negative impact on margin in 2017 from the deferred revenue fair value accounting adjustment which had a significantly lesser impact in 2018 and ii improvement in margins for our premium services in 2018

other 





 

during 2018 the company divested all three of the noncore businesses that comprised its other segment each of which were acquired as part of the acquisition of ceb inc in april 2017 both revenue and gross contribution declined in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the divestitures

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings note 5 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k provides additional information regarding the companys outstanding debt obligations at december 31 2018 we had 1564 million of cash and cash equivalents and 10 billion of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility under our 2016 credit agreement we believe that the company has adequate liquidity to meet its currently anticipated needs 

we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model in our research segment which is our largest business segment and historically has constituted the majority of our total revenues the majority of our research customer contracts are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow cash flow generation has also benefited from our ongoing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase sales 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world with 79 held overseas at december 31 2018 the company intends to reinvest substantially all of its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings except in instances where repatriation would result in minimal additional tax as a result of the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we believe that the income tax impact if such earnings were repatriated would be minimal 

the following table summarizes the changes in the companys cash balances for the years indicated in thousands

operating 

cash provided by operating activities was 4712 million in 2018 compared to 2545 million in 2017 an increase of 2166 million the yearoveryear increase was driven by net income of 1225 million in 2018 compared to net income of 33 million in 2017 as well as substantially higher receivable collections during 2018 partially offsetting these increases in 2018 were higher cash amounts paid for bonuses taxes and interest on our borrowings as well as decreases in our other working capital accounts

2017 versus 2016 

operating 

cash provided by operating activities was 2545 million in 2017 compared to 3656 million in 2016 the decline was due to a decline in net income which was 33 million in 2017 compared to 1936 million in 2016 unfavorable changes in working capital in 2017 compared to 2016 and substantially higher cash payments for bonuses commissions interest on our borrowings and acquisition and integration costs in 2017 compared to 2016

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

at december 31 2018 the company had 23 billion in outstanding debt approximately 15 billion of the companys total debt outstanding as of december 31 2018 was based on a floating base rate of interest which potentially exposes the company to increases in interest rates however we partially reduce our overall exposure to changes in interest rates through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively converts the floating base interest rate on a portion of these variable rate borrowings to fixed rates thus we are exposed to base interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings only in excess of any amounts that are not hedged at december 31 2018 we had unhedged interest rate risk on approximately 1100 million of borrowings as an indication of our potential exposure to changes in interest rates a hypothetical 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could change our annual pretax interest expense by approximately 03 million 

foreign currency risk 

  

for both the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 a significant portion of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the united states among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar as the values of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risk 

translation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity deficit a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018 we had 1564 million of cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2018 would have increased or decreased by approximately 120 million the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings since movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar 

  

transaction risk arises when we enter into a transaction that is denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency a gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding currency contracts as of december 31 2018 had an immaterial net unrealized loss 

  

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and its foreign exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

competition 

we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly with consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services while we believe the breadth and depth of our research positions us well versus our competition increased competition could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions and trends the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our   business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could   therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may   also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

risks related to our business 

on april 5 2017 gartner acquired ceb inc ceb references to heritage gartner operating results and business measurements refer to gartner excluding ceb references to ceb refer to the operating results and business measurements of ceb subsequent to the acquisition 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic   conditions  our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the united states and abroad in its january 2018 global economic prospects report the world bank 

notes that global growth is expected to continue while substantial downside risks are present to include financial stress protectionism and geopolitical change we also believe that terrorist attacks around the world have added additional uncertainty and risks to the economic environment a downturn in growth could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services in general in certain geographic regions or in particular countries or industry sectors such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth and attract attendees and exhibitors to our events such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could   materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services  we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information and advice that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our published data opinions or viewpoints prove to be wrong lack independence or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could materially adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services   or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain   competitive  the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations develop enhance and improve our existing as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

as a result of the acquisition of ceb in 2017 a portion of our revenue is now derived from products services and tools that relate to human talent assessment management and development which were new products for the company revenue from these activities is concentrated in our talent assessment  other business segment revenue from these activities is affected in part by our ability to create new offerings as demand changes and our ability to support existing offerings if we fail to successfully manage and grow this new business our operating results financial condition and liquidity could be negatively impacted also economic downturns in certain segments or geographic regions may cause reductions in discretionary spending by our customers which may adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow the volume of business 

technology is rapidly evolving and if we do not continue to develop new product and service offerings in response to these changes our business could suffer disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the environment in which we our clients and our competitors operate we will need to continue to respond to these changes by enhancing our product and service offerings in order to maintain our competitive position however we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhance our products on a timely basis and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our clients our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new or enhanced existing offerings that address the changing needs of this constantly evolving marketplace failure to develop products that meet the needs of our clients in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

our research business depends on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new   subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our   failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services   could lead to a decrease in our revenues  a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted approximately 70 and 71 of our total revenues for 2017 and 2016 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription contracts are typically for 12months or longer our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our heritage research client retention rate was 84 at both december 31 2017 and 2016 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

our consulting business depends on nonrecurring engagements and our failure to secure new   engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues  consulting segment revenues constituted 10 of our total revenues in 2017 and 14 in 2016 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting engagements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition in addition revenue from our contract optimization business can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not predictable 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be   adversely affected by external factors beyond our control  our events business constituted 10 of our total revenues in 2017 and 11 in 2016 the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks war weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major events 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated  we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the united states government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2017 and 2016 approximately 4350 million and 3550 million respectively of our contracts were attributable to government entities our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time by the government entity without cause or penalty “termination for convenience” in addition contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures compliance 

requirements and intense competition should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of revenues 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could   jeopardize our future growth plans as well as the quality of our products and services  our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel to support the evolving needs of clients or the projected growth in our business could materially adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name  we believe that our “gartner” brand in particular our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote maintain and protect the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational and other risks which   could negatively impact our future revenue and growth  we have clients in more than 100 countries and a substantial amount of our revenue is earned outside of the united states our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights or against economic espionage in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

our business and operations may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy it is our policy to comply and to require our local partners and those with whom we do business to comply with all applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate our business and reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws 

we are exposed to volatility in foreign currency   exchange rates from our international operations  for both the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 42 of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the united states revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations additionally our effective tax rate is increased as the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies which could impact our operating results 

natural disasters terrorist acts war and other geopolitical events could disrupt our business  we operate in numerous us and international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe a major weather event earthquake flood drought volcanic activity disease or other catastrophic natural disaster could significantly disrupt our operations in addition acts of civil unrest failure of critical infrastructure terrorism armed conflict war and abrupt political change as well as responses by various governments and the international community to such acts can have a negative effect on our business such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt or shut down the internet or other critical clientfacing and business processes impede the travel of our personnel and clients dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel and in general harm our ability to conduct normal business operations any of which can negatively impact our financial condition and operating results such events could also impact the timing and budget decisions of our clients which could materially adversely affect our business 

privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our events  concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to   damage our reputation and deter current and prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our events in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including event attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients 

and prospects while we believe our overall data privacy procedures are adequate the theft or loss of such data or concerns about our practices even if unfounded with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data protection related matters could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our operating results any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users’ personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our events as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business 

in addition new data protection laws and regulations particularly the new european union general data protection regulation “gdpr” effective in may 2018 pose increasingly complex compliance challenges we are closely monitoring these legal developments and are working towards timely gdpr compliance in the meantime gartner will continue to maintain and rely upon our comprehensive global data protection compliance program which includes administrative technical and physical controls to safeguard our associates’ and clients personal data the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states the european union and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business  a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems to conduct our operations individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers they may develop and deploy malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions these threats are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them a cyberattack widespread internet failure or internet access limitations or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial results 

we take steps to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation regulatory action and scrutiny or other costs as a result of these occurrences 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to   maintain an adequate operations infrastructure  our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results 

our outstanding debt obligations could negatively impact our financial condition and future operating results   as of december 31 2017 the company had outstanding debt of 25 billion under its 2016 term loan and revolving credit facility the 2016 credit agreement and 8000 million of senior notes due 2025 senior notes the 2016 credit agreement was amended three times during 2017 and it currently provides for a 15 billion term loan a facility a 5000 million term loan b facility and a 12 billion revolving credit facility the company borrowed significant amounts in 2017 under the 2016 credit agreement and issued the senior notes in conjunction with the ceb acquisition additional information regarding the 2016 credit facility and the senior notes is included in note 5 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

the debt service requirements of these credit arrangements could impair our future financial condition and operating results in addition the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2016 credit agreement as amended as well as the covenants related to the senior notes could limit our future financial flexibility a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding which could materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be 

negotiated with our lenders and noteholders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those currently the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on   favorable terms or at all  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our   competitive position may be harmed  we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

our employees are subject to restrictive covenant agreements which include restrictions on employees ability to compete and solicit customers and employees and assignment of invention agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the period expires relating to the particular restriction former employees may compete against us if a former employee violates the provisions of hisher restrictive covenant agreement we seek to enforce the restrictions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic   investments which could involve substantial risks  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

our business has increased significantly with the ceb acquisition our success depends in part upon our ability to continue to integrate its operations as well as manage the overall expanded business which poses substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations new products and associated increased cost and complexity a failure to realize the expected benefits from the acquisition or successfully manage the expanded operation could adversely and materially affect our future business and operating results 

we face risks related to leased office space  with the ceb acquisition we assumed a significant amount of additional leased office space in particular in arlington virginia which formerly served as cebs headquarters location and where the majority of its staff is currently located gartner is continuing with a plan originally approved by ceb before the acquisition to relocate and consolidate its office space in arlington into a new nearby building and sublease the entirety of the existing space the consolidation into the new building is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018 with the first set of moves already completed in december 2017 we have also made significant progress in subleasing the existing space and we expect to sublease all of the remaining space during 2018 however if we are unable to sublease the remaining existing space at acceptable rents or at all or if subtenants default on their sublease obligation with us or otherwise terminate the subleases with us we may experience a loss of planned sublease rental income which could result in a material charge which could adversely affect our operating results 

we are also in the process of adding new leased space if the new spaces are not completed on schedule or if the landlord defaults on its commitments and obligations pursuant to the new leases we may incur additional expenses in addition unanticipated difficulties in initiating operations in this new space including construction delays it system interruptions or other infrastructure 

support problems could result in a delay in moving into the new space resulting in a loss of employee and operational productivity and a loss of revenue andor additional expenses which could also have an adverse material impact on our operating results 

we face risks related to litigation  we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us which we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation  we are a global company and a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the united states and taxed at rates less than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities 

at the present time the united states and other countries where we do business have either changed or are actively considering changes in their tax accounting and other related laws in the united states recently enacted tax reform introduced several new complicated tax laws which could unfavorably impact our future effective tax rate in 2014 ireland modified its tax residency rules while these changes are not effective until 2021 for many companies with irish resident operations including gartner the new rules could increase our effective tax rate at that future date likewise during 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” released final reports on various actions items associated with its initiative to prevent base erosion and profit shifting “beps” numerous countries have and continue to propose unilateral tax law changes intended to address beps the future enactment by various governments of these and other proposals could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and as we gather more information and perform additional analysis the impact of the new law may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the future 

in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by various tax authorities recent and future actions on the part of the oecd and various governments have increased scrutiny of our tax filings although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows particularly in major taxing jurisdictions including but not limited to the united states ireland india canada united kingdom japan and france 

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 1940 million of accumulated undistributed earnings in our nonus subsidiaries our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2017 97 of our cash and cash equivalents was held overseas with a substantial portion representing accumulated undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under us gaap no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings is required if the company intends to reinvest such earnings overseas indefinitely our current liquidity requirements do not demonstrate a need to repatriate accumulated undistributed foreign earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our us operations accordingly the company intends to continue to reinvest substantially all of its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings except in instances in which the repatriation of those earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result we have not recognized income tax expense on the amounts deemed permanently reinvested however with the recently enacted us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we envision that the income tax that would be payable if such earnings were repatriated would be minimal 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws regulations or our policies a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for 

the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

risks related to our common stock 

  

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period andor the financial guidance we have given may not meet the   expectations of investors which may cause the price of our common stock to decline  our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in our industry the impact of our acquisitions and general economic conditions an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have previously provided if this occurs the price of our common stock could decline 

  

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may   not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you   paid  the price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions geopolitical events changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control including any and all factors that move the securities markets generally these factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

future sales or issuances of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock   price  sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock the issuance of additional shares of our common stock could also lower the market price of our common stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market we have a boardapproved share repurchase program and at december 31 2017 approximately 11 billion remained available for share purchases under this program no assurance can be given that we will continue these share repurchase activities in the future when the program is completed or in the event that the price of our common stock reaches levels at which repurchases are not accretive 

future sales of our common stock from grants and awards could lower our stock   price  as of december 31 2017 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under our equity incentive plans was approximately 28 million shares approximately 13 million of which have vested in addition at the present time approximately 56 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable and have been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act which are subject to certain limitations we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours  to our knowledge as of the date hereof and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings five institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control   even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock ii advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings and iii the antitakeover provisions of delaware law these provisions could 

discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

fluctuations in quarterly results 

our quarterly and annual revenues operating income loss and cash flows fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series that normally occurs during the fourth quarter as well as our other events the timing and amount of new business generated including from acquisitions the mix of domestic and international business domestic and international economic conditions changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in the industry the payment of performance compensation and other factors that are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income loss could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods 

  

our critical accounting policies pertaining to the years presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

  

revenue recognition  — revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of us gaap as well as sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition  revenue is only recognized when all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

  

 

 

 

 

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update no 201409  revenue from contracts with customers  on january 1 2018 see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of this accounting standard and its impact on the companys revenue recognition policies 

  

uncollectible fees receivable  — we maintain an allowance for losses that is comprised of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience an assessment of current economic conditions the aging of outstanding receivables the financial health of specific clients and probable losses this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates the valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

  

the following table presents our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands 



goodwill and other intangible assets  — when we acquire a business we determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition which may include a significant amount of intangible assets such as customer relationships software content and other intangible assets as well as resulting goodwill when determining the fair values of the acquired intangible assets we consider among other factors analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business the fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using an income approach that relies on discounted cash flows this method starts with a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset and then adjusts the forecast to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams we consider this approach to be the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of the acquired intangible assets is their ability to generate future income in a typical acquisition we engage a thirdparty valuation expert to assist us with the fair value analyses for acquired intangible assets 

determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets requires us to exercise significant judgment we select reasonable estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors including but not limited to marketplace participants consumer awareness and brand history additionally there are significant judgments inherent in discounted cash flows such as estimating the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the selection of appropriate discount rates hypothetical royalty rates and contributory asset capital charges specifically the discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the underlying acquired intangible assets 

determining an acquired intangible assets useful life requires significant judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors including but not limited to the expected use of the asset historical client retention rates consumer awareness and trade name history as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an assets useful life 

the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 

fasb asc topic 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or a combination of the two approaches both methods utilize estimates which in turn require judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty if our goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we may recognize an impairment charge among the factors that we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment actual and projected reporting unit financial performance forwardlooking business measurements and external market assessments a quantitative analysis requires management to consider each of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections to include the rate of revenue growth profitability and cash flows as well as assumptions regarding discount rates the companys weighted average cost of capital and other data in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units we conducted a qualitative assessment of the fair value of all of the companys reporting units during the quarter ended september 30 2017 the results of this test determined that the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values and as a result no goodwill impairment was indicated see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets 

  

accounting for income taxes  — the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in assessing the realizability of 

deferred tax assets we consider if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this assessment we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position 

accounting for stockbased compensation  — the company accounts for stockbased compensation awards in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 and no 110 the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period see note 8 — stockbased compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards requires the use of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of a stockbased compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate periodic stockbased compensation expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stockbased compensation awards and the related periodic expense represent management’s best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if circumstances change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stockbased compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

restructuring and other accruals  — we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year

acquisition and integration charges increased 1159 million during 2017 when compared to 2016 this increase reflects the additional charges resulting from our recent acquisitions and primarily consist of higher professional fees severance stockbased compensation charges and accruals for exit costs for certain office space that the company does not intend to occupy in arlington virginia 

  

operating loss income was an operating loss of 63 million during 2017 compared to operating income of 3051 million in 2016 the decline reflects several factors we had a lower segment contribution margin in our research business resulting from a ceb deferred revenue fair value adjustment we also had higher sga and acquisitionrelated costs including depreciation amortization of intangibles and acquisition and integration charges

net income was 33 million and 1936 million during 2017 and 2016 respectively the yearoveryear change primarily reflects declines in our operating profitability and higher interest expense partially offset by income tax benefits in 2017 including the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 as a result of substantially lower net income and a 7 increase in the number of weighted average shares outstanding diluted earnings per share declined to 004 in 2017 from 231 in 2016

we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained and enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model in our research segment which is our largest business segment revenues in our research segment increased 33 in 2017 compared to 2016 and constituted 75 of our total revenues in both 2017 and 2016 the majority of our research customer contracts are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume

operating 

cash provided by operating activities was 2545 million in 2017 compared to 3656 million in 2016 the decline was due to i a decline in net income which was 33 million in the 2017 period compared to 1936 million in the 2016 period ii unfavorable changes in working capital in 2017 compared to 2016 and iii substantially higher cash payments for bonuses commissions interest on our borrowings and acquisition and integration costs in the 2017 period compared to 2016

2016 versus 2015 

operating 

operating cash flow increased by 201 million or 6 in 2016 compared to 2015 the 2016 increase was primarily due to higher net income and the adoption of asu no 201609 partially offsetting these increases were higher cash payments for acquisition and integration costs bonus and commissions and interest on our borrowings

the fasb has issued accounting standards that have not yet become effective and that may impact the company’s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures in future periods note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements herein provides information regarding these accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

at december 31 2017 the company had 33 billion in outstanding debt approximately 25 billion of the companys total debt outstanding as of december 31 2017 was based on a floating base rate of interest which potentially exposes the company to increases in interest rates however we partially reduce our overall exposure to changes in interest rates through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively converts the floating base interest rate on a portion of these variable rate borrowings to fixed rates thus we are exposed to base interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings only in excess of any amounts that are not hedged at december 31 2017 we had unhedged interest rate risk on approximately 11 billion of borrowings as an indication of our potential exposure to changes in interest rates a hypothetical 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could change our annual pretax interest expense by approximately 28 million 

foreign currency risk 

  

for both years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 42 of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the united states among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar as the values 

of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risk 

translation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity deficit a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2017 we had 5389 million of cash and cash equivalents excluding cash heldforsale with a substantial portion denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2017 would have increased or decreased by approximately 280 million the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings since movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar 

  

transaction risk arises when our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions that are denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency a gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding currency contracts as of december 31 2017 had an immaterial net unrealized loss 

  

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and its foreign exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

management conducted an evaluation as of december 31 2017 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a 15e and 15d 15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material company information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

gartner management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f gartner’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth in the internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso management’s assessment was reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

based on its assessment of internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that as of december 31 2017 gartner’s internal control over financial reporting was effective the effectiveness of management’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in this annual report on form 10k in part iv item 15 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

the company acquired two businesses in 2017 l2 and ceb we are currently in the process of integrating these businesses evaluating their internal controls and implementing the companys internal control structure over these operations due to the timing of these acquisitions we have excluded them from the scope of our sarbanesoxley section 404 report on internal control over financial reporting for our fiscal year ending december 31 2017 this exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the staff of the securities and exchange commission that an assessment of a recent business acquisition may be omitted from managements report on internal control over financial reporting in the first year of consolidation we expect to complete the implementation of our internal control structure over these acquisitions in 2018

competition 

  

we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly with consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services while we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions and trends the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our   business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could   therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may   also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

risks related to our proposed merger with ceb inc 

we may not complete the proposed transaction with ceb within the timeframe we anticipate or at all which could have a negative effect on our results of operations on january 5 2017 we announced together with ceb inc nyse ceb ceb that we entered into a definitive agreement whereby we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of ceb in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately 26 billion we will also assume and refinance approximately 09 billion of ceb debt the transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies closing of the transaction is subject to the approval of ceb shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions the transaction is also subject to other risks and uncertainties such as the possibility that ceb could receive an unsolicited proposal from a third party or that either we or ceb could exercise our respective termination rights if the transaction is not consummated or is materially delayed for any reason we will have spent considerable time and resources and incurred substantial costs related to the merger many of which must be paid even if the merger is not consummated we cannot provide any assurance that the transaction will be consummated that there will not be a delay in the consummation of the merger or that all or any of the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the transaction will be obtained if the merger is not consummated our reputation in our industry and in the investment community could be damaged and the market price of our common stock could decline 

we may not be able to obtain our preferred form of financing to consummate the merger and the terms of the financing may be less favorable to us than expected depending on market conditions there is no financing condition under the merger agreement which means that if the conditions to closing are otherwise satisfied or waived we are obligated to consummate the merger whether or not we have sufficient funds to pay the consideration under the merger agreement we currently intend to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration repay and redeem certain outstanding indebtedness of ceb and its subsidiaries and pay related fees and expenses in connection with the merger using a combination of new term loans proceeds from the issuance of debt securities or to extent such debt securities are not issued borrowings under a highyield bridge credit facility borrowings under a 364day credit facility borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and cash on hand 

although we have obtained debt commitments from certain lenders in connection with our financing plan such commitment is subject to a number of conditions and we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to close the financing as anticipated in addition although the debt commitment letter for the financing specifies a number of terms for the different facilities we retain some exposure to changes in pricing and other terms based on market conditions at the time the financing is consummated which could result in less favorable terms for the financing than expected the terms of the expected issuance of debt securities are not committed and the pricing and terms of such debt securities may be less favorable than expected if terms for the debt financing are less favorable than expected financing costs could increase potentially significantly and our financing or operating flexibility may be constrained in addition the short tenor of the 364day credit facility together with duration fees pricing stepups and other terms of the 364day credit facility and highyield bridge credit facility if drawn provide significant economic incentive for us to refinance those facilities which could result in us accessing the market at a less favorable time than we would otherwise choose if we cannot close on any element of our financing plan we will need to pursue other financing options which may result in less favorable financing terms that could increase costs andor materially adversely affect the credit rating or financing and operating flexibility of the combined company 

if the merger agreement is terminated we may under certain circumstances be obligated to pay a termination fee to ceb these costs could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances we would be required to pay ceb a reverse termination fee of 1250 million if the merger agreement is terminated we may decide to pay the termination fee from available cash that we would have otherwise used for general corporate purposes for these and other reasons a failed merger could materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and cash flows or the price per share of our common stock 

we may experience difficulties in integrating our operations with cebs and realizing the expected benefits of the transaction with ceb the success of the transaction with ceb if consummated will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining with ceb in an efficient and effective manner we may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects further our management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures ceb will continue to operate independently of us until the consummation of the transaction the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses tax costs or inefficiencies or inconsistencies in standards controls information technology systems procedures and policies any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers employees or other third parties or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction and could harm our financial performance if we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of ceb’s business with our business we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the proposed transaction and our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

risks related to our business 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic   conditions  our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the united states and abroad global economic growth including in the united states has been subdued in recent years and there is concern this trend will continue in 2017 terrorist attacks around the world and significant political shifts such as the change in us political leadership have added additional uncertainty and risks to the economic environment these trends and conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services in general in certain geographic regions or in particular industry sectors such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could   materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services  we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our published data opinions or viewpoints prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could materially adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services   or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain   competitive  the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations develop enhance and improve our existing as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally 

significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

technology is rapidly evolving and if we do not continue to develop new product and service offerings in response to these changes our business could suffer disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the environment in which we our clients and our competitors operate we will need to continue to respond to these changes by enhancing our product and service offerings in order to maintain our competitive position however we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhance our products on a timely basis and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our clients our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new or enhanced existing offerings that address the changing needs of this constantly evolving marketplace failure to develop products that meet the needs of our clients in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new   subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our   failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services   could lead to a decrease in our revenues  a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted approximately 75 and 73 of our total revenues for 2016 and 2015 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription contracts are typically for 12months or longer our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 84 at both december 31 2016 and 2015 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new   engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues  consulting segment revenues constituted 14 of our total revenues in 2016 and 15 in 2015 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting engagements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition in addition revenue from our contract optimization business can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not predictable 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be   adversely affected by external factors beyond our control  the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks war weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major events 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated  we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the united states government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2016 and 2015 approximately 3550 million and 3450 million respectively of our total contracts were attributable to government entities our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause or penalty “termination for convenience” similarly contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures compliance requirements and intense competition should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of revenues 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could   jeopardize our future growth plans as well as the quality of our products and services  our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel to support the evolving needs of clients or the projected growth in our business could materially adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name  we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational and other risks which   could negatively impact our future revenue and growth  we have clients in over 90 countries and a substantial amount of our revenue is earned outside of the united states our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

our business and operations may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy it is our policy to comply and to require our local partners and those with whom we do business to comply with all applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate our business and reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws 

we are exposed to volatility in foreign currency   exchange rates from our international operations  for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 42 and 41 respectively of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the united states revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations additionally our effective tax rate is increased as the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies which could impact our operating results 

natural disasters terrorist acts war and other geopolitical events could disrupt our business  we operate in numerous us and international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe a major weather event earthquake flood drought volcanic activity disease or other catastrophic natural disaster could significantly disrupt our operations in addition acts of civil unrest failure of critical infrastructure terrorism armed conflict war and abrupt political change as well as responses by various governments and the international community to such acts can have a negative effect on our business such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt or shut down the internet or other critical clientfacing and business processes impede the travel of our personnel and clients dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel and in general harm our ability to conduct normal business operations any of which 

can negatively impact our financial condition and operating results such events could also impact the timing and budget decisions of our clients which could materially adversely affect our business 

privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our events  concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to   damage our reputation and deter current and prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our events in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including event attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects name email address job title and do not as a rule collect sensitive personal information like the social security numbers used in the united states while we may collect credit card numbers on a limited basis from some clients to facilitate payment we do not store such numbers even if unfounded concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data privacy related matters could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our operating results in addition because many of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users’ personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our events as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business 

in addition while we had been a safe harbor certified company for a number of years and while we have implemented a companywide privacy compliance program regulatory authorities around the world continue to adopt new laws regulations and penalties concerning data privacy most recently the european commission adopted the euus privacy shield framework which as of the date of this report has undergone a number of legal challenges as to its validity and the european parliament formally adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which will become effective in may 2018  we are closely monitoring these legal developments and are working towards timely gdpr compliance in the meantime gartner will continue to maintain and rely upon our comprehensive global data privacy compliance program and robust processes to safeguard our associates’ and clients personal data the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states the european union and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business  a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems to conduct our operations individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers they may develop and deploy malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions these threats are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them a cyberattack widespread internet failure or internet access limitations or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial results 

we take steps to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to   maintain an adequate operations infrastructure  our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services 

and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results 

our outstanding debt obligations could impact our financial condition or future operating results  we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 6000 million term loan and a 12 billion secured five year revolving credit facility the “2016 credit agreement” the 2016 credit agreement was amended on january 20 2017 to permit the acquisition of ceb and the incurrence of an additional 1375 billion senior secured term loan b facility a 3000 million 364day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured highyield bridge facility of up to 6000 million or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities the notes to finance in part the acquisition and repay certain debt of ceb and to modify certain covenants the first amendment in connection with financing the ceb acquisition the company has also received a commitment with respect to 6000 million unsecured senior bridge facilities the 2016 credit agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 7500 million in the aggregate plus additional amounts subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including a maximum secured leverage ratio at december 31 2016 we had a total of 7000 million outstanding under the 2016 credit agreement 

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2016 credit agreement as amended as well as the covenants related to the notes by the first amendment could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the 2016 credit agreement and the notes which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders and noteholders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the 2016 credit agreement the associated debt service costs of these credit arrangements could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on   favorable terms or at all  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our   competitive position may be harmed  we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

our employees are subject to noncompete agreements nonsolicitation agreements and assignment of invention agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic   investments which could involve substantial risks  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

we face risks related to litigation  we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us which we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation  we are a global company with clients in over 90 countries a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the united states and taxed at rates significantly less than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities 

at the present time the united states and other countries where we do business have either changed or are actively considering changes in their tax accounting and other related laws in the united states proposed and other tax law changes particularly those directed at taxing unremitted and future foreign earnings could increase our effective tax rate in 2014 ireland modified its tax residency rules while these changes are not effective until 2021 for many companies with irish resident operations including gartner the new rules could increase our effective tax rate at that future date likewise during 2015 the organization for economic development and cooperation “oecd” released final reports on various actions items associated with its initiative to prevent base erosion and profit shifting “beps the future enactment by various governments of these and future oecd proposals could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by various tax authorities recent and future actions on the part of the oecd and various governments will likely result in increased scrutiny of our tax filings although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows particularly in major taxing jurisdictions including but not limited to the united states ireland india canada united kingdom japan and france 

as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 3400 million of accumulated undistributed earnings in our nonus subsidiaries under us gaap rules no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the company has the ability and intent to reinvest such funds overseas indefinitely our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our us operations we intend to reinvest these earnings in our nonus operations except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result the company has not recognized income tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings however future events such as a change in our liquidity needs or us tax laws could cause us to change our repatriation policy and decide to repatriate some or all of these undistributed earnings as a result we could be required to accrue additional taxes in the future which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position cash flows and results of operations in future periods 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws regulations or our policies a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

risks related to our common stock 

  

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period andor the financial guidance we have given may not meet the   expectations of investors which may cause the price of our common stock to decline  our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in our industry the impact of our acquisitions and general economic conditions an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have previously provided if this occurs the price of our common stock could decline 

  

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may   not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you   paid  the price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions geopolitical events changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control including any and all factors that move the securities markets generally these factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock   price  sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market at the present time we are executing against a boardapproved share repurchase program to reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock at december 31 2016 approximately 11 billion remained available for share purchases under this program no assurance can be given that we will continue these activities in the future when the program is completed or in the event that the price of our common stock reaches levels at which repurchases are not accretive 

future sales of our common stock from grants and awards could lower our stock   price  as of december 31 2016 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under our equity incentive plans was approximately 26 million shares approximately 15 million of which have vested in addition at the present time approximately 62 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable and have been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act which are subject to certain limitations we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours  to our knowledge as of the date hereof and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings three institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control   even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i the ability of our board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock ii advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings and iii the antitakeover provisions of delaware law these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

business measurements 

  

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 



  

executive summary of operations and financial position 

  

we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive doubledigit annual revenue and earnings growth the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research insight delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings building a strong sales capability providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention and continuously improving our operational effectiveness 

  

we had total revenues of 24 billion in 2016 an increase of 13 over 2015 on a reported basis and 14 adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange diluted earnings per share was 231 in 2016 compared to 206 in 2015 a 12 increase primarily driven by higher net income which increased 10 in 2016 and to a lesser extent a lower weightedaverage share count which declined 1 

  

research revenues increased 16 yearoveryear to 183 billion in 2016 and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency research revenues increased 17 the contribution margin was 69 the same as 2015 at december 31 2016 total contract value was 193 billion an increase of 9 over december 31 2015 on a reported basis and 14 adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange both client and wallet retention remained strong at 84 and 104 respectively at december 31 2016 

  

consulting revenues increased 6 in 2016 to 3462 million while the impact of foreign currency exchange was not significant the gross contribution margin was 31 in 2016 compared to 33 in 2015 consultant utilization was 66 in both periods we had 628 billable consultants at december 31 2016 compared to 606 at yearend 2015 backlog was 1038 million at december 31 2016

for a more detailed discussion of our results see the segment results section below 

  

cash flow from our operating activities was 3656 million in 2016 an increase of 6 compared to 2015 our 2016 cash flow from operating activities benefited from the early adoption of fasb asu 201609  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which changed the accounting for stockbased compensation awards see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information we ended 2016 with 4742 million in cash and cash equivalents while 11 billion was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line 

we continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value during 2016 we repurchased 06 million shares of our outstanding common stock and we also acquired two businesses in addition in january 2017 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement whereby gartner will acquire all of the outstanding shares of ceb inc an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights see note 16 — subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

fluctuations in quarterly results 

  

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry acquisitions general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing changes to our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods 

  

our critical accounting policies are as follows 

  

revenue recognition  — revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of us gaap as well as sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition  “sab no 104” revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

  

 

 

 

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

  

uncollectible fees receivable  — we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience an assessment of current economic conditions the aging of outstanding receivables the financial health of specific clients and probable losses this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

  

the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands as of 



goodwill and other intangible assets  — the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic no 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 

asc topic no 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty if our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment actual and projected reporting unit financial performance forwardlooking business measurements and external market assessments a quantitative analysis requires management to consider all of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections to include the rate of revenue growth profitability and cash flows as well as assumptions regarding discount rates the companys weightedaverage cost of capital and other data in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units 

we conducted a qualitative assessment of the fair values of all of the companys reporting units during the third quarter of 2016 the results of this test concluded that the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets 

  

accounting for income taxes  — the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position 

accounting for stockbased compensation  — the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic no 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 “sab no 107” and no 110 “sab no 110” the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period see note 8 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stockbased compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period in 2016 the company early adopted fasb asu no 201609  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  asu no 201609 requires certain changes in accounting for stock compensation under fasb asc topic no 718 note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the adoption of asu no 201609 

  

restructuring and other accruals  — we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year

we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained and enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model in our research segment which is our largest business segment revenues in our research segment increased 16 in 2016 compared to 2015 and constituted 75 and 73 of our total revenues in 2016 and 2015 respectively the majority of our research customer contracts are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume 

we had operating cash flow of 3656 million in 2016 compared to 3456 million in 2015 during 2016 we used 1250 million in cash to pay down debt and related fees and we used almost 500 million in cash for capital expenditures we also used 342 million in cash in 2016 to acquire other businesses and 590 million to repurchase our common stock the amount of cash used in 2016 to acquire other businesses and for stock repurchases was significantly less than 2015 we currently have a 12 billion board approved authorization to repurchase the companys common stock and as of december 31 2016 approximately 11 billion of this authorization remains 

definitive agreement to acquire ceb inc 

on january 5 2017 the company and ceb announced that they entered into a definitive agreement whereby gartner will acquire all of the outstanding shares of ceb in a transaction valued at approximately 26 billion the aggregate consideration to be paid by gartner is expected to be approximately 18 billion in cash and 08 billion of gartner common stock gartner will also assume and refinance approximately 09 billion in ceb debt closing of the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017 

in connection with the proposed acquisition the company entered into a commitment letter for the purposes of financing the majority of the cash consideration payable and to refinance ceb’s indebtedness the commitment letter provides for a total of 2275 billion in additional financing which includes a sevenyear senior secured term loan b facility of up to 1375 billion a 364day senior unsecured bridge facility of up to 3000 million and a senior unsecured highyield bridge facility of up to 6000 million it is expected that on or prior to the closing of the ceb acquisition senior unsecured notes will be issued and sold pursuant to an offering pursuant to rule 144a or a private placement in lieu of a portion of or all of the drawings under the highyield bridge facility the company expects that the proceeds from the additional financing described above together with its balance sheet cash and available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration and refinance cebs indebtedness as well as pay for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition the closing of the transaction and related borrowings will significantly increase the companys outstanding debt 

cash and cash equivalents 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2016 approximately 4320 million of our total 4742 million in cash and cash equivalents was held outside the us of the 4320 million of cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states at december 31 2016 approximately 3400 million represents accumulated undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under us gaap rules no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the company has the ability and intent to reinvest such funds overseas indefinitely our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our us operations we intend to reinvest these earnings in our nonus operations except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result the company has not recognized income tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings 

however future events such as a change in our liquidity needs or us tax laws could cause us to change our repatriation policy and decide to repatriate some or all of these undistributed earnings as a result we could be required to accrue additional taxes in the future which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position cash flows and results of operations in future periods 

the following table summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the threeyears ended december 31 2016 in thousands 





  

 

2016 versus 2015 

operating 

operating cash flow increased by 201 million or 6 in 2016 compared to 2015 the 2016 increase was primarily due to higher net income and the adoption of asu no 201609 partially offsetting these increases were higher cash payments for acquisition and integration costs bonus and commissions and interest on our borrowings 

investing 

we used 840 million of cash in our investing activities in 2016 compared to 2424 million of cash used in 2015 cash used in 2015 was substantially higher due to additional expenditures for acquisitions

cash used was 1747 million in 2016 which consisted of 590 million paid for share repurchases and 1250 million for payments and fees on debt which was partially offset by 93 million in cash realized from employee sharerelated activities in the 2015 period the company used 677 million in cash in its financing activities with 5090 million in cash used for share repurchases while net borrowings on debt and employee sharerelated activities provided cash of 4413 million 

2015 versus 2014 

operating 

  

operating cash flow decreased slightly when comparing 2015 to 2014 the decrease reflects the negative impact of a stronger us dollar and lower 2015 net income as well as additional cash payments for employee incentives related to our acquisitions income taxes and interest on our debt obligations in the 2015 period partially offsetting these elements were additional collections in the 2015 period 

investing 

we used an additional 796 million of cash in our investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the acquisitions we made during 2015 in total we used 1962 million and 1243 million of cash net of the cash acquired for acquisitions in 2015 and 2014 respectively the company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance its 2015 acquisitions we also used an additional 76 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2015 period with a total of 461 million used in 2015 compared to 385 million in 2014

recently issued accounting standards 

  

accounting standards issued by the various us standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective and may impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periods 

business combinations — in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201701  clarifying the definition of a business asu no 201701 which is effective for gartner on january 1 2018 asu no 201701 changes the gaap definition of a business which can impact the accounting for asset purchases acquisitions goodwill impairment and other assessments we are currently evaluating the impact of asu no 201701 on our consolidated financial statements 

statement of cash flows — in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618  restricted cash asu no 201618 asu no 201618 requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be presented with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows if different a reconciliation of the cash balances reported in the cash flow statement and the balance sheet would need to be provided along with explanatory information asu no 201618 is effective for gartner on january 1 2018 we are currently evaluating the impact of asu no 201618 on our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes — in october 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201616  intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory asu no 201616 asu no 201616 accelerates the recognition of taxes on certain intraentity transactions and is effective for gartner on january 1 2018 current gaap requires deferral of the income tax implications of an intercompany sale of assets until the assets are sold to a third party or recovered through use under the new rule the seller’s tax effects and the buyer’s deferred taxes will be immediately recognized upon the sale we have completed an initial evaluation of the impact of asu no 201616 and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted but could impact the timing of recognition of taxes on future intraentity transfers 

statement of cash flows — in august 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201615 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments  asu no 201615 asu no 201615 sets forth classification requirements for certain cash flow transactions asu no 201615 is effective for gartner on january 1 2018 but early adoption is permitted we have completed an initial evaluation of the impact of asu no 201615 and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

financial instrument credit losses —   in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613  financial instruments—credit losses  asu no 201613 asu no 201613 amends the current financial instrument impairment model by requiring entities to use a forwardlooking approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments including trade receivables asu no 201613 is effective for gartner on january 1 2020 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the potential impact of asu no 201613 on our consolidated financial statements 

leases — in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602  leases  asu no 201602 which will require significant changes in the accounting and disclosure for lease arrangements currently under us gaap lease arrangements that meet certain criteria are considered operating leases and are not recorded on the balance sheet all of the companys existing lease arrangements are accounted for as operating leases and are thus not recorded on the companys balance sheet asu no 201602 will significantly change the accounting for leases since a rightofuse rou model must be used in which the lessee must record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for leases with terms longer than 12 months leases will be classified as either finance or operating arrangements with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement asu no 201602 also requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements asu no 201602 will be effective for gartner on january 1 2019 we are currently evaluating the impact of asu no 201602 on our consolidated financial statements

revenue — in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409  revenue from contracts with customers  asu no 201409 asu no 201409 and related amendments require changes in revenue recognition policies as well as enhanced disclosures asu no 201409 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in existing 

revenue recognition rules provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue recognition issues improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets and provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosures we have completed an initial assessment of the impact of asu no 201409 on our existing revenue recognition policies and we plan to adopt the rule on january 1 2018 using the cumulative effect method of adoption asu no 201409 also requires significantly expanded disclosures around the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers which we are currently compiling while we have not completed our assessment of the impact of asu no 201409 based on the analysis completed to date we do not currently anticipate that the new rule will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

the fasb also continues to work on a number of other accounting rules which if issued could impact our accounting policies and disclosures in future periods however since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

the companys 2016 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 6000 million term loan and a 12 billion revolving credit facility at december 31 2016 we had 7000 million outstanding under the 2016 credit agreement which included 5850 million outstanding under the term loan and 1150 million under the revolver the 2016 credit agreement was amended on january 20 2017 to permit the acquisition of ceb and the incurrence of an additional 1375 billion senior secured term loan b facility 3000 million 364day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured highyield bridge facility of up to 6000 million or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities to finance in part the acquisition and repay certain debt of ceb and to modify certain covenants in addition in connection with financing the ceb acquisition the company has received a commitment with respect to 6000 million senior unsecured bridge facilities 

we have cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates since amounts currently borrowed under our 2016 credit agreement are based on a floating base rate of interest however we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base interest rate on the first 7000 million of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rates thus we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under the 2016 credit agreement only if our borrowings exceed 7000 million at december 31 2016 the amount of unhedged borrowings under the 2016 credit agreement was zero 

foreign currency risk 

  

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 42 and 41 respectively of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the united states we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar as the values of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risk 

translation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity deficit a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016 we had 4742 million of cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2016 would have increased or decreased by approximately 210 million the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings since movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar 

  

transaction risk arises because our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions that are denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency a gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding currency contracts as of december 31 2016 had an immaterial net unrealized loss 

  

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and its foreign exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have a limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

management conducted an evaluation as of december 31 2016 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a 15e and 15d 15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material company information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

gartner management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f gartner’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth in the internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso management’s assessment was reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

based on its assessment of internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that as of december 31 2016 gartner’s internal control over financial reporting was effective the effectiveness of management’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in this annual report on form 10k in part iv item 15 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

during the quarter ended december 31 2016 we identified deficiencies in certain general information technology controls gitcs that affected the use of a reportwriter it application operated in connection with the company’s enterprise resource planning systems specifically we did not have effective controls over the configuration of the reports and completeness and accuracy of information presented in the reports reports produced by the reportwriter it application are used in the operation of certain key internal controls we have determined that these deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting constituted a material weakness that originated in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2016 the deficiencies resulted in no misstatements to the current or previously issued financial statements 

in connection with the operation of key internal controls performed during the year ended december 31 2016 management designed and implemented effective controls over the generation of information and reports using the reportwriter it application going forward and retrospectively operated those controls for each instance that the reports were used by management as part of its internal control over financial reporting during fiscal year 2016 thereby remediating the material weakness as of december 31 2016 further we have enhanced the design of our existing gitcs over the reportwriter application we will monitor these new controls going forward 

we have determined that the actions taken to date have sufficiently improved the company’s internal control over financial reporting such that as of december 31 2016 there is not a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis based on the remediation of the deficiencies we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2016 

other than the changes noted above there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2016 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

competition 

  

we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly with consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services while we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our   business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could   therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may   also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

risks related to our business 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic   conditions  our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the us and abroad severe downward pressures on global commodity prices and a lower growth rate in china have contributed to a general outlook of weaker economic growth both in the us and abroad in 2016 recent geopolitical events such as the terrorist attacks in france have added to the uncertainty these conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services in general in certain geographic regions or in particular industry sectors such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could   materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services  we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our published data opinions or viewpoints prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services   or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain   competitive  the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations develop enhance and improve our existing as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business the results of operations and our financial position 

technology is rapidly evolving and if we do not continue to develop new product and service offerings in response to these changes our business could suffer disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the environment in which we our clients and our competitors operate we will need to continue to respond to these changes by enhancing our product and service offerings in order 

to maintain our competitive position however we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhance our products on a timely basis and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our clients our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new or enhanced existing offerings that address the changing needs of this constantly evolving marketplace failure to develop products that meet the needs of our clients in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business the results of operations and our financial position 

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new   subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our   failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services   could lead to a decrease in our revenues  a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted approximately 73 and 72 of our total revenues for 2015 and 2014 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription contracts are typically for twelve months or longer our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 84 at december 31 2015 and 85 at december 31 2014 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new   engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues  consulting segment revenues constituted 15 of our total revenues in 2015 and 17 in 2014 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition in addition revenue from our contract optimization business can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not predictable 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be   adversely affected by external factors beyond our control  the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks war weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major events 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated  we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 3450 million and 3100 million respectively of our total contracts were attributable to government entities we believe substantially all of the amounts attributable to government entities at december 31 2015 will be filled in 2016 our us government contracts are subject 

to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause or penalty “termination for convenience” similarly contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures compliance requirements and intense competition should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of consolidated and segment revenues 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could   jeopardize our future growth plans as well as the quality of our products and services  our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals recent improvements in the us economy have heightened this competition additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel to support the evolving needs of clients or the projected growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name  we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational and other risks which   could negatively impact our future revenue and growth  we have clients in over 90 countries and a substantial amount of our revenue is earned outside of the us our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

our business and operations may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy it is our policy to comply and to require our local partners and those with whom we do business to comply with all applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate our business and reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws 

we are exposed to volatility in foreign currency   exchange rates from our international operations  revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations additionally our effective tax rate is increased as the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies which could impact our operating results 

natural disasters terrorist acts war and other geopolitical events could disrupt our business  we operate in numerous us and international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe a major weather event earthquake flood drought volcanic activity disease or other catastrophic natural disaster could significantly disrupt our operations in addition acts of civil unrest failure of critical infrastructure terrorism armed conflict war and abrupt political change as well as responses by various governments and the international community to such acts can have a negative effect on our business such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt or shut down the internet or other critical clientfacing and business processes impede the travel of our personnel and clients dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel and in general harm our ability to conduct normal business operations any of which can negatively impact our financial condition and operating results such events could also impact the timing and budget decisions of our clients which could negatively impact our business 

privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our events  concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to   damage our reputation and deter current and 

prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our events in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including event attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects name email address job title and do not as a rule collect sensitive personal information like the social security numbers used in the us while we may collect credit card numbers on a limited basis from some clients to facilitate payment we do not store such numbers 

even if unfounded concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data privacy related matters could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results in addition because many of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users’ personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our events as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business 

in addition while we have been a safe harbor certified company for a number of years and while we have implemented a companywide privacy compliance program regulatory authorities around the world continue to adopt new laws regulations and penalties concerning data privacy most recently the european court of justice invalidated the safe harbor framework between the us and eu countries w hich thousands of global companies including gartner relied on for the lawful transfer of personal data from the eu to the us and as of the date of this report an agreement regarding a new framework entitled the euus privacy shield has been announced we are closely monitoring developments as the eu and us work to address this issue until there is definitive guidance for us companies impacted by this decision gartner will continue to maintain and rely upon our comprehensive global data privacy compliance program and robust processes to safeguard our associates’ and clients personal data 

the interpretation and application of these laws in the us the eu and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices complying with these various laws as well as the yet to be issued definitive guidance for us companies concerning the transmission of personal data between the eu and us could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business  a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems to conduct our operations individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers they may develop and deploy malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions these threats are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them a cyberattack widespread internet failure or internet access limitations or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial results 

we take steps to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to   maintain an adequate operations infrastructure  our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results 

our outstanding debt obligations could impact our financial condition or future operating results  we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 4000 million term loan and a 11 billion revolving credit facility the “2014 credit agreement” in addition the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 5000 million in the aggregate at december 31 2015 we had a total of 8200 million outstanding under the 2014 credit agreement 

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2014 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the 2014 credit agreement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on   favorable terms or at all  we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our   competitive position may be harmed  we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

our employees are subject to noncompete agreements nonsolicitation agreements and assignment of invention agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic   investments which could involve substantial risks  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

we face risks related to litigation  we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us which we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation  we are a global company with operations and clients in over 90 countries a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the us and taxed at rates significantly less than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities 

at the present time the united states and other countries where we do business have either changed or are actively considering changes in their tax accounting and other related laws in the united states proposed and other tax law changes particularly those directed at taxing unremitted and future foreign earnings could increase our effective tax rate in 2014 ireland modified its tax residency rules while these changes are not effective until 2021 for many companies with irish resident operations including gartner the new rules could increase our effective tax rate at that future date likewise during 2015 the organization for economic development and cooperation “oecd” released final reports on various actions items associated with its initiative to prevent base erosion and profit shifting “beps the future enactment by various governments of these and future oecd proposals could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by various tax authorities recent and future actions on the part of the oecd and various governments will likely result in increased scrutiny of our tax filings although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows particularly in major taxing jurisdictions including but not limited to the united states ireland india canada united kingdom japan and france 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws regulations or our policies a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

risks related to our common stock 

  

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period andor the financial guidance we have given may not meet the   expectations of investors which may cause the price of our common stock to decline  our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in our industry and the impact of our acquisitions an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have previously provided if this occurs the price of our common stock could decline 

  

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may   not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you   paid  the price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions geopolitical events changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control including any and all factors that move the securities markets generally these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock   price  sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market at the present time we are executing against a boardapproved share repurchase program to reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock at december 31 2015 approximately 11 billion remained available for share purchases under this program no assurance can be given that we will continue these activities in the future when the program is completed or in the event that the price of our common stock reaches levels at which repurchases are not accretive 

future sales of our common stock from grants and awards could lower our stock   price  as of december 31 2015 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under our equity incentive plans was approximately 27 million shares approximately 05 million of which have vested in addition at the present time approximately 70 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable and have been registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act which are subject to certain limitations we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours  to our knowledge as of the date hereof and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings four institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control   even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include 

 

these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

business measurements 

  

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 



  

executive summary of operations and financial position 

  

we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive doubledigit annual revenue and earnings growth the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings building a strong sales capability providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention and continuously improving our operational effectiveness 

  

we had total revenues of 2163 billion in 2015 an increase of 7 over 2014 on a reported basis and 13 adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange diluted earnings per share increased to 206 per share in 2015 from 203 per share in 2014 

  

research revenues rose 10 yearoveryear to 1583 billion in 2015 and the contribution margin was 69 the same as 2014 at december 31 2015 research contract value was 1761 billion an increase of 10 over december 31 2014 on a reported basis and 14 adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange both client and wallet retention remained strong at 84 and 105 respectively at december 31 2015 

  

consulting revenues in 2015 decreased 6 when compared to 2014 but were flat when adjusted for the foreign exchange impact the gross contribution margin was 33 in 2015 compared to 34 in 2014 consultant utilization declined by 2 points in 2015 to 66 we had 606 billable consultants at december 31 2015 compared to 535 at yearend 2014 backlog increased 15 yearoveryear to 1177 million at december 31 2015 which is the highest in the companys history

for a more detailed discussion of our results see the segment results section below 

  

cash flow from our operating activities was 3456 million in 2015 we ended 2015 with 3730 million in cash and cash equivalents while 6560 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

we continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value during 2015 we repurchased 62 million of our outstanding common shares and we also acquired nubera ebusiness sl based in barcelona spain nubera and capterra inc based in arlington virginia capterra both of which help organizations find the right business software to meet their needs note 2  acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k provides additional information regarding these acquisitions 

  

fluctuations in quarterly results 

  

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry acquisitions general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

  

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results ongoing 

changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods 

  

our critical accounting policies are as follows 

  

revenue recognition  — revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of us gaap as well as sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition  “sab 104” revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

  

 

 

 

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

  

uncollectible fees receivable  — we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience an assessment of current economic conditions the aging of outstanding receivables the financial health of specific clients and probable losses this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

  

the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands 



goodwill and other intangible assets  — the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic no 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 

asc topic no 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty if our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment actual and projected reporting unit financial performance forwardlooking business measurements and external market assessments a quantitative analysis requires 

management to consider all of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections to include the rate of revenue growth profitability and cash flows as well as assumptions regarding discount rates the companys weightedaverage cost of capital and other data in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units 

we conducted a quantitative assessment of the fair value of all of the companys reporting units during the third quarter of 2015 the results of this test determined that the fair values of the companys reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets 

  

accounting for income taxes  — the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position 

accounting for stockbased compensation  — the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic no 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 “sab no 107” and no 110 “sab no 110” the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

  

restructuring and other accruals  — we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year

net income was 1756 million in 2015 and 1838 million in 2014 a decrease of 4 diluted earnings per share increased 1 yearoveryear to 206 in 2015 compared to 203 in 2014 due to a 6 decrease in the number of weightedaverage shares in the 2015 period

2015 versus 2014 

  

consulting revenue decreased 6 yearoveryear but was essentially flat excluding the negative foreign exchange impact the revenue decline was primarily in our core consulting practice which was mainly driven by the foreign exchange impact we also had lower revenues in our contract optimization practice which can fluctuate from period to period the yearoveryear gross contribution margin declined by 1 point primarily driven by higher headcount backlog increased by 151 million yearoveryear or 15 to 1177 million at december 31 2015 which is the highest backlog in the companys history 

  

2014 versus 2013 

  

consulting revenues increased 11 yearoveryear and 12 when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange the increase was primarily due to higher core consulting revenues and to a lesser extent higher contract optimization revenues contract optimization revenues can fluctuate from period to period but are generally about 1015 of total annual consulting segment revenues the gross contribution margin was 34 for both periods backlog decreased 35 million or 3 yearoveryear to 1026 million at december 31 2014

the following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our events segment as of and for the twelve months ended december 31 



 

2015 versus 2014 

  

events revenues increased 241 million when comparing 2015 to 2014 or 11 excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation revenues increased 18 yearoveryear we held 65 events in 2015 consisting of 61 ongoing events and 4 new events compared to 61 events in 2014 the yearoveryear revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher attendee revenue at our ongoing events and to a lesser extent higher exhibitor revenuethe number of attendees in 2015 increased 7 while the number of exhibitors increased 4 average revenue per attendee rose 9 and average revenue per exhibitor increased 2 the gross contribution margin increased 3 points yearoveryear

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 3730 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 and 6560 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2014 credit agreement in addition the 2014  credit agreement contains an expansion feature by which the company may borrow up to an additional 5000 million in the aggregate under certain conditions we believe that our consistently strong operating cash flow as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity under our 2014 credit agreement provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs however should we need to borrow additional amounts we believe we would be able to do so on reasonable terms 

we had operating cash flow of 3456 million in 2015 in addition we also borrowed an additional 4200 million on a net basis under our 2014 credit agreement during 2015 we used 1962 million in cash to acquire other businesses and we also used 5090 million in cash to repurchase our common shares we currently have a 12 billion board approved authorization to repurchase the companys common stock and as of december 31 2015 approximately 11 billion of this authorization remains 

  

we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies revenues in our research segment which is our largest business segment increased 10 in 2015 compared to 2014 and constituted 73 and 72 of our total revenues in 2015 and 2014 respectively the majority of our research contracts are paid in advance and renew annually and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume 

  

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2015 approximately 3510 million of our total of 3730 million in cash and cash equivalents was held outside the us of the 3510 million of cash and cash equivalents held overseas approximately 80 represents unremitted earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under us accounting rules no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the company intends to reinvest such funds overseas indefinitely our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our us operations we intend to reinvest these earnings in our nonus operations except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result the company has not recognized additional income tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings however should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings we may be required to accrue additional taxes which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position cash flows and results of operations in future periods 

changes in cash and cash equivalents 

  

the following table summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the three years ended december 31 2015 in thousands 



  

 

2015 versus 2014 

operating 

  

operating cash flow decreased slightly when comparing 2015 to 2014 the decrease reflects the negative impact of a stronger us dollar and lower 2015 net income as well as additional cash payments for employee incentives related to our acquisitions income taxes and interest on our debt obligations in the 2015 period partially offsetting these elements were additional collections in the 2015 period 

investing 

we used an additional 796 million of cash in our investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the acquisitions we made during 2015 in total we used 1962 million and 1243 million of cash net of the cash acquired for acquisitions in 2015 and 2014 respectively the company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance its 2015 acquisitions we also used an additional 76 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2015 period with a total of 461 million used in 2015 compared to 385 million in 2014 

  

financing 

  

in total we used 677 million of cash in our financing activities during 2015 compared to 2087 million of cash used in 2014 the company used 5090 million of cash for share repurchases in 2015 compared to 4320 million used for share repurchases in 2014 the company borrowed an additional 4200 million in 2015 on a net basis compared to 2000 million of net additional borrowings in 2014 additions to financing cash flows from employee sharebased activities were 214 million 2015 and 280 million in 2014 

2014 versus 2013 

operating 

  

operating cash flow increased by 311 million or 10 when comparing 2014 to 2013 the increase was primarily due to additional cash collections in our research and events businesses and other positive working capital changes partially offsetting the additional collections were higher cash payments for bonuses commissions and income taxes 

investing 

  

we used an additional 1263 million of cash in our investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 principally due to the 2014 acquisitions in which we paid a total of 1099 million net of the cash acquired and an additional 143 million was placed in escrow the company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance its 2014 acquisitions we also used an additional 20 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2014 period 

financing 

  

we used 2087 million of cash in our financing activities during 2014 compared to 1539 million of cash used in 2013 during 2014 the company used 4320 million of cash for share repurchases which was partially offset by 1954 million of net proceeds from debt issuance and related debt issuance costs and 280 million from employee sharebased activity during 2013 the company used 1820 million of cash for share repurchases and 40 million for debt refinancing fees which was partially offset by 320 million from employee sharebased activities 

obligations and commitments

quarterly financial data 

  

the following tables present our quarterly operating results for the twoyear period ended december 31 2015 

  





  

  

 

recently issued accounting standards 

  

accounting rules issued by the various us standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective and that may impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periods 

business combinations 

in september 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201516  business combinations  simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments  asu no 201516 asu no 201516 requires the recognition of adjustments to business combination provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined the effects of the adjustments to provisional amounts on depreciation amortization or other income effects should be recognized in currentperiod earnings as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date disclosure of the portion of the adjustment recorded in currentperiod earnings that would have been reported in prior reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date is also required the rule is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for gartner on january 1 2016 asu no 201516 will not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements at the date of adoption however asu no 201616 could have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements in the future if a transaction occurs within the scope of the rule 

debt issuance cost presentation 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 “ simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs ” which amends the current presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements asu no 201503 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts instead of a deferred asset the amendment is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for 

gartner on january 1 2016 the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409  revenue from contracts with customers  asu no 201409 asu no 201409 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue recognition requirements providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements asu no 201409 is effective for gartner on january 

1 2018 we continue to evaluate the impact of asu no 201409 

the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which if issued could materially impact the companys accounting policies and disclosures in future periods however since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

the companys 2014 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 4000 million term loan and a 11 billion revolving credit facility at december 31 2015 we had 8200 million outstanding under the 2014 credit agreement which included 3800 million outstanding under the term loan and 4400 million under the revolver 

we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement since amounts borrowed are based on a floating base rate of interest however we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates through our interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base interest rate on the first 7000 million of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rates thus we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings only in excess of 7000 million which equaled 1200 million at december 31 2015 as an indication of our exposure to changes in interest rates a hypothetical 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could have changed our 2015 pretax annual interest expense on the 1200 million of unhedged borrowings at december 31 2015 by approximately 03 million 

foreign currency risk 

  

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 approximately 41 and 45 respectively of the companys revenues were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the reporting currency of our financial statements is the us dollar as the values of the foreign currencies in which we operate fluctuate over time relative to the us dollar the company is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risk 

translation risk arises as our foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency adjustments resulting from the translation of these assets and liabilities are deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders’ deficit equity a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 approximately half of our 3730 million of cash and cash equivalents was denominated in foreign currencies if the exchange rates of the foreign currencies we hold all changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2015 would have increased or decreased by approximately 190 million the translation of our foreign currency revenues and expenses historically has not had a material impact on our consolidated earnings since movements in and among the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally however our earnings could be impacted during periods of significant exchange rate volatility or when some or all of the major currencies in which we operate move in the same direction against the us dollar 

  

transaction risk arises when our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions that are denominated in a currency that may differ from the local functional currency as these transactions are translated into the local functional currency gain or loss may result which is recorded in current period earnings we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of some of this foreign currency transaction risk our outstanding currency contracts as of december 31 2015 had an immaterial net unrealized gain 

  

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest rate swap contracts and its foreign exchange contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

competition 

  

we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly with consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services while we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 item 1a risk factors 

  

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our   business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could   therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may   also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

  

risks related to our business 

  

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic   conditions  our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the us and abroad us economic data continues to be mixed but the overall economy continues to grow and unemployment continues to fall however economic growth continues to be uneven globally with continuing weakness across europe and emerging markets as recent geopolitical events add to the uncertainty these conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could   materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely 

delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

  

we may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services  we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our data viewpoints or predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner including via the internet and mobile applications failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

  

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services   or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain   competitive  the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations develop enhance and improve our existing as well as new products and services to address those needs deliver all products and services in a timely userfriendly and state of the art manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

  

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new   subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our   failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services   could lead to a decrease in our revenues  a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 72 and 71 of our total revenues for 2014  and 2013  respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is a challenging costly and often time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

the majority of our research subscription agreements are for twelve months however we do enter into multiyear agreements which have been increasing in frequency our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

  

 

 

 

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research enterprise client retention rate was 85 at december 31 2014  and 83 at december 31 2013  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

  

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new   engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues  consulting segment revenues constituted 17 of our total revenues in 2014 and 18 in 2013 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

  

 

 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition in addition revenue in our contract optimization business can fluctuate from period to period 

  

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be   adversely affected by external factors beyond our control  the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending geopolitical crises terrorist attacks weather natural disasters communicable diseases and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economies the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event we also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major events 

  

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated  we derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 3100 million and 2830 million respectively of our total contracts were attributable to government entities we believe substantially all of the amounts attributable to government entities at december 31 2014 will be filled in 2015 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause or penalty “termination for convenience” similarly contracts with us federal state and local and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures compliance requirements and intense competition should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues 

  

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could   jeopardize our future growth plans as well as the quality of our products and services  our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals recent improvements in the us economy have heightened this competition additionally some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any inability to retain key personnel or to hire and train additional qualified personnel to support the evolving needs of clients or the projected growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

  

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name  we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

  

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which   could negatively impact our future revenue and growth  we have clients in over 90 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues is earned outside of the us our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

  

we are exposed to volatility in foreign currency   exchange rates from our international operations  revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations additionally our effective tax rate is increased as the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies which could impact our operating results 

  

natural disasters or geopolitical events may disrupt our business  a major weather event terrorist attack earthquake flood volcanic activity or other catastrophic disaster could significantly disrupt our operations such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing and business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe abrupt political change terrorist activity communicable diseases and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions which may negatively impact our sales and increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results 

privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our events  concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to   damage our reputation and deter current and prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our events in the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws we collect personal information i from our employees ii from the users of our products and services including event attendees and iii from prospective clients we collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects name email address job title and do not as a rule collect sensitive personal information like ssns and credit card numbers 

even if unfounded concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of this personal information or other data privacy related matters could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results in addition because many of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users’ personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our events as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business 

  

in addition while we are a safe harbor certified company and while we have implemented a companywide privacy compliance program regulatory authorities around the world continue to adopt new laws regulations and penalties concerning data privacy the interpretation and application of these laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain inconsistent and ever changing it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

  

internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business  a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems to conduct our operations individuals groups and statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations our computer systems our employees and our customers they may develop and deploy malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information launch distributed denial of service attacks or attempt other coordinated disruptions these threats are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them a cyberattack widespread internet failure or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial results 

we take steps to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to   maintain an adequate operations infrastructure  our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect 

to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels such as mobile applications however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results 

our outstanding debt obligation could impact our financial condition or future operating results  we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 4000 million term loan and a 11 billion revolving credit facility the “2014 credit agreement” in addition the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 5000 million in the aggregate at december 31 2014 we had a total of 4000 million outstanding under the term loan of the 2014 credit agreement 

  

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2014 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

  

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on   favorable terms or at all  we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

  

however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital including acquisitions if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

  

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our   competitive position may be harmed  we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret patent confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

our employees are subject to noncompete agreements to the extent permitted under applicable law when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

  

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic   investments which could involve substantial risks  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

  

we face risks related to litigation  we are and in the future may be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a claim is made against us which we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms our business brand and financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation  we are a global company with operations and clients in over 90 countries a substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the us and taxed at rates significantly less than the us statutory federal income tax rate our effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and conversely lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets andor by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities 

at the present time the united states and other countries where we do business have either changed or are actively considering changes in their tax accounting and other related laws in the united states proposed tax law changes particularly those directed at taxing unremitted and future foreign earnings could increase our effective tax rate in addition ireland recently modified its tax residency rules while at the present time these changes are not effective until 2020 for many companies with irish resident operations including gartner the new rules could increase our effective tax rate at that future date likewise certain international organizations such as the organization for economic development and cooperation are actively considering proposals certain of which if enacted by foreign governments could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business these actual potential and other changes both individually and collectively could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows particularly in major taxing jurisdictions including but not limited to the united states ireland india canada united kingdom japan france and italy 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  we operate in a number of countries including emerging markets and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws regulations or our policies a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business 

  

risks related to our common stock 

  

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the   expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have given   which may cause the price of our common stock to decline  our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have previously provided if this occurs the price of our common stock could decline 

  

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may   not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you   paid  the price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions geo 

political events changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control including any and all factors that move the securities markets generally these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock   price  sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market at the present time we are executing against a boardapproved share repurchase program to reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock at december 31 2014 4133 million remained available for share purchases under this program no assurance can be given that we will continue these activities in the future when the program is completed or in the event that the price of our common stock reaches levels at which repurchases are not accretive

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours  to our knowledge as of the date hereof and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings four institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control   even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include 

 

these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

fluctuations in quarterly results 

  

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

  

the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s financial statements in future periods 

  

our critical accounting policies are as follows 

  

revenue recognition  — revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of us gaap and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

  

 

 18 

 

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

  

uncollectible fees receivable  — we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

  

the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands 



goodwill and other intangible assets  — the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a quantitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty in 2014 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach based on this assessment the company believes the fair values of the company’s reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

  

accounting for income taxes  — the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider the availability of loss carryforwards projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment the company recognizes the tax 

benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position 

accounting for stockbased compensation  — the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 “sab no 107” and no 110 “sab no 110” the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stockbased compensation 

  

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

  

restructuring and other accruals  — we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 

  

we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities for 2014 we had operating cash flow of 3468 million which was the highest in the company’s history and represented an increase of 10 over 2013 our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies revenues in our research segment which increased 14 in 2014 compared to 2013 constituted 72 and 71 of our total revenues in 2014 and 2013 respectively the majority of our research contracts renew annually and typically are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has generally resulted in strong growth in operating cash flow each year our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume 

  

we had over 3650 million of cash and cash equivalents at yearend 2014 we refinanced our debt in 2014 to take advantage of favorable market conditions and we had approximately 11 billion of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at yearend 2014 we believe that our consistently strong operating cash flow as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs

2014 versus 2013 

operating 

  

operating cash flow increased by 311 million or 10 when comparing 2014 to 2013 the increase was primarily due to additional cash collections in our research and events businesses and other positive working capital changes partially offsetting the additional collections were higher cash payments for bonuses commissions and income taxes 

investing 

we used an additional 1263 million of cash in our investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 principally due to the 2014 acquisitions in which we paid a total of 1099 million net of the cash acquired and an additional 144 million was placed in escrow the company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance the 2014 acquisitions we also used an additional 20 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2014 period

investing 

  

cash used in our investing activities declined by 182 million in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease was primarily due to 103 million of cash used in 2012 for the acquisition of ideas international and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures in 2012

recently issued accounting standards 

  

accounting rules issued by the various us standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective and may impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periods 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409  revenue from contracts with customers  asu no 201409 asu no 201409 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue recognition requirements providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements the provisions of the new rule are effective for gartner on january 1 2017 early adoption is not permitted we continue to evaluate the impact of asu no 201409 

discontinued operations 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity asu 201408 which changes the criteria for determining which disposal transactions can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements under the new guidance a discontinued operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results the company adopted the new rule on january 1 2015 and it did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the company’s accounting and disclosures in future periods since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  

the companys 2014 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 4000 million term loan and a 11 billion revolving credit facility we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement since amounts borrowed are based on a floating base rate of interest at december 31 2014 we had 4000 million  outstanding under the term portion of the 2014 credit agreement and zero under the revolver we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate since the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings we are exposed to interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings in excess of 2000 million assuming the company borrowed the entire 15 billion under the 2014 credit agreement as of december 31 2014 a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could change pretax annual interest expense by approximately 33 million 

foreign currency risk 

  

for both the fiscal years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 45 of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar this foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk 

  

translation risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time for accounting purposes these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact our operating results 

  

a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2014 we had over 3650 million of cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the five major foreign currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2014 could have increased or decreased by approximately 240 million 

  

because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally 

  

transaction risk 

  

we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since foreign subsidiaries typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and both realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2014 we had 77 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately 456 million and an immaterial net unrealized gain substantially all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2015 

  

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and an interest rate swap contract the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contract are with large investment grade commercial banks accounts receivable balances collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

 item 1a risk factors 

  

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our   business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could   therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may   also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

  

risks related to our business 

  

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic   conditions  our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the us and abroad economic growth continues to be both weak and uneven in many parts of the world in addition problems continue with government deficit spending in the us and other countries ongoing uncertainty in global trade and high levels of sovereign debt these conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could   materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

  

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services  we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

  

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services   or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain   competitive  the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for 

information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

  

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new   subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our   failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services   could lead to a decrease in our revenues  a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 71 and 70 of our revenues for 2013  and 2012  respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription agreements are generally for twelve months although we do enter into multiyear agreements in certain circumstances our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

  

 

 

 

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 82 at december 31 2013  and 83 at december 31 2012  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

  

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new   engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues  consulting segment revenues constituted 18 of our total revenues in 2013 and 19 in 2012 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

  

 

 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

  

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be   adversely affected by external factors beyond our control  the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns reductions in government spending terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event additionally a significant recovery in the global economy could make our ability to procure space for our events and efforts to keep associated costs down more challenging 

  

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated  we derive significant revenues from contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 2830 million and 2550 million 

respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments we believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at december 31 2013 will be filled in 2014 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services additionally our contracts at the state and local levels as well as foreign government contracts are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause or penalty “termination for convenience” similarly contracts with domestic and foreign governments and their agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures and intense competition should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues 

  

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could   jeopardize the quality of our products and services  our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

  

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name  we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

  

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which   could negatively impact our future revenue and growth  we have clients in 85 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues is earned outside of the us our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

  

our international operations expose us to volatility in foreign currency   exchange rates  revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

  

natural disasters or geopolitical events may disrupt our business  a major weather event terrorist attack earthquake flood volcanic activity or other catastrophic disaster could significantly disrupt our operations such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing and business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions which may negatively impact our sales and increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results 

  

internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business  a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems a cyberattack widespread internet failure or disruption of our critical information technology systems through viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could 

significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results 

  

we take steps generally acknowledged as standard for the industry to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences 

  

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to   maintain an adequate operations infrastructure  our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results 

our outstanding debt obligation could impact our financial condition or future operating results  we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 1500 million term loan and a 6000 million revolving credit facility the “2013 credit agreement” the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 2500 million in the aggregate at december 31 2013 we had a total of 2000 million outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement 

  

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2013 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

  

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on   favorable terms or at all  we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

  

however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

  

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our   competitive position may be harmed  we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

  

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic   investments which could involve substantial risks  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

  

we face risks related to litigation  we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits any such claim can affect our reputation and responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business brand results of operations or financial position could be materially and adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation  we operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world the company recognizes tax expense based upon the applicable tax rates and tax laws of the countries where income is generated a substantial amount of our income is generated outside of the us and is taxed at rates significantly less than the us statutory income tax rate of 35 the us and many other countries in which the company operates are considering proposals which may significantly change the taxation of income earned outside of the us our future effective tax rate financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in law or if more of our income is earned in higher taxing jurisdictions and less is earned in lower taxing jurisdictions 

in addition our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by taxing authorities and during the ordinary course of business we are under audit by one or more tax authorities although we believe that our tax filings are reasonable the final resolution of tax audits may be different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  we operate in a number of countries and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws or regulations a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a material impact on our business 

  

risks related to our common stock 

  

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the   expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given   which may cause the price of our common stock to decline  our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline 

  

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may   not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you   paid  the trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations 

regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock   price  sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market 

  

as of december 31 2013 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under these plans was approximately 36 million shares approximately 08 million of which have vested in addition approximately 64 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable without further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

  

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours  to our knowledge as of december 31 2013 and based upon publiclyavailable sec filings five institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control   even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include 

 

these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

we have three business segments research consulting and events 

  

 

 

 

business measurements 

  

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 

  



  

executive summary of operations and financial position 

  

we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive doubledigit annual revenue and earnings growth the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings building a strong sales capability providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention and continuously improving our operational effectiveness 

  

we had total revenues of 17842 million in 2013 an increase of 10 over 2012 while diluted earnings per share increased by 20 per share to 193 excluding the impact of foreign currency 2013 total revenues increased 11 over 2012 

  

research revenues rose 12 yearoveryear to 12710 million in 2013 and the contribution margin increased 1 point to 69 at december 31 2013 research contract value was 14232 million an increase of 13 over december 31 2012 and 12 adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange client retention was 82 and wallet retention was 98 at december 31 2013 

  

consulting revenues in 2013 increased 3 compared to 2012 while the gross contribution margin was 34 consultant utilization was 64 for 2013 compared to 67 in 2012 and we had 509 billable consultants at december 31 2013 compared to 503 at yearend 2012 backlog increased 3 yearoveryear to 1061 million at december 31 2013 

  

events revenues increased 14 yearoveryear to 1989 million while the segment contribution margin was 46 we held 64 events in 2013 compared to 62 in 2012 with a slight decline in the number of attendees 

for a more detailed discussion of our results see the segment results section below 

  

cash flow from our operating activities increased 13 in 2013 compared to 2012 to 3157 million we continued to focus on maximizing shareholder value in 2013 and we repurchased 34 million of our outstanding common shares during the year we ended 2013 with almost 4240 million in cash and cash equivalents which is a record yearend cash balance we refinanced our debt in 2013 to take advantage of favorable market conditions and as of yearend 2013 we had over 5410 million of borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

fluctuations in quarterly results 

  

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the timing and amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry general economic conditions and other factors which are beyond our control the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

  

the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s financial statements in future periods 

  

our critical accounting policies are as follows 

  

revenue recognition  — revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

  

 

 

 

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal 

funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

  

uncollectible fees receivable  — we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

  

the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands 



goodwill and other intangible assets  — the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a qualitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty in 2013 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach based on this assessment the company believes the fair values of the company’s reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

  

accounting for income taxes  — we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made 

accounting for stockbased compensation  — the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 “sab no 107” and no 110 “sab no 110” the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stockbased compensation 

  

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

  

restructuring and other accruals  — we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 

  

we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end

cost of services and product development “cos” expense increased 8 in 2013 compared to 2012 or 544 million to 7135 million compared to 6591 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business and to a lesser extent merit salary increases we also had higher conference costs due to an increase in the number of events a doubledigit increase in the number of exhibitors at our events and the upgrading of facilities in several locations to support anticipated growth in the events business these additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency cos as a percentage of revenues was 40 in the 2013 period compared to 41 in the 2012 period 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased by 816 million in 2013 or 12 to 7605 million compared to 6788 million in 2012 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact the higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount and to a lesser extent higher sales commissions and merit salary increases the increased headcount includes additional quotabearing sales associates which increased to 1643 at december 31 2013 a 16 increase over yearend 2012

during 2013 the company closed the internal revenue service “irs” audit of its 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns the resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations of the company 

in late 2013 the company received notice that the irs intends to conduct an audit of the companys 2010 and 2011 tax years the audits for these years have commenced and are in the early stages of examination although the final resolution of these audits is uncertain the company believes that the ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “2012 tax act” was enacted in january of 2013 and contained beneficial tax provisions for the company which applied retroactively to 2012 however since the 2012 tax act was passed in 2013 approximately 15 million of tax benefits relating to its retroactive application were recorded by the company in early 2013 

  

net income was 1828 million in 2013 and 1659 million in 2012 an increase of 169 million or 10 primarily due to the higher operating income which was partially offset by higher income tax charges diluted earnings per share increased 12 yearoveryear due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent a lower number of weightedaverage shares outstanding

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased by 651 million in 2012 or 11 to 6788 million compared to 6137 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact the higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount and to a lesser extent higher sales commissions and merit salary increases the increased headcount includes additional quotabearing sales associates which increased to 1417 at december 31 2012 a 12 increase over the prior yearend 

  

depreciation expense decreased slightly yearoveryear due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated which was only partially offset by the additional depreciation related to asset additions capital expenditures increased to 443 million in 2012 from 420 million in 2011 which includes 170 million and 95 million respectively of expenditures for the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility up to 250 million of these expenditures are reimbursable by the facility landlord and as of december 31 2012 220 million had been reimbursed 

  

amortization of intangibles decreased yearoveryear due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized which was only partially offset by the additional amortization from the intangible assets recorded from the ideas international acquisition in mid2012 

  

acquisition and integration charges was 24 million in 2012 and zero in 2011 these charges related to the acquisition of ideas international in mid2012 and included legal consulting severance and other costs 

  

operating income increased 316 million yearoveryear or 15 to 2457 million in 2012 from 2141 million in 2011 operating income as a percentage of revenues was 15 for both periods although both research and events had higher segment contributions in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a lower contribution in consulting as well as higher sga expenses as discussed above 

  

interest expense net declined by 11 in 2012 when compared to 2011 the decline was primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding which declined to 2070 million in 2012 from 2200 million in 2011 as well as lower amortization of capitalized debt refinancing costs 

  

other expense net was 13 million in 2012 and 19 million in 2011 these expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

  

provision for income taxes was 697 million in 2012 compared to 653 million in 2011 and the effective tax rate was 296 for 2012 compared to 323 for 2011 the lower effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily attributable to the recognition of tax benefits in 2012 resulting from the settlement of tax audits as well as benefits recorded in 2012 relating to the recognition of certain state tax credits 

  

during 2012 the company closed the irs audit of its 2007 federal income tax return the resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations of the company 

  

net income was 1659 million in 2012 and 1369 million in 2011 an increase of 290 million or 21 primarily due to a higher operating income which was partially offset by 44 million in higher income tax charges although the yearoveryear effective tax rate declined pretax income increased substantially resulting in the higher dollar amount of tax charges both basic and diluted earnings per share increased 24 yearoveryear due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent a lower number of weightedaverage shares outstanding 

  

segment results 

  

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain cost of services and product development charges sga depreciation acquisition and integration charges and amortization of intangibles gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues

2013 versus 2012 

  

consulting revenues increased 3 yearoveryear and 4 when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange the increase was due to higher contract optimization revenue which can fluctuate from period to period and are generally about 10 of total consulting segment revenues the increased contract optimization revenues were partially offset by slightly lower core consulting and strategic advisory “sas” revenues the gross contribution margin declined by 2 points due to higher payroll and benefit costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases and to a lesser extent lower utilization in core consulting backlog increased 34 million or 3 yearoveryear to 1061 million at december 31 2013 

  

2012 versus 2011 

  

consulting revenues decreased 1 yearoveryear due to lower revenues in our contract optimization business the decrease in contract optimization revenue was substantially offset by higher core consulting revenues which increased 5 yearoveryear driven by additional demand and increased headcount sas revenues were flat yearoveryear excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues increased 1 yearoveryear the gross contribution margin declined by 1 point due to the lower revenues in our contract optimization business which has a higher contribution margin than core consulting or sas backlog increased 2 yearoveryear to 1027 million at december 31 2012

2013 versus 2012 

  

events revenues increased 252 million when comparing 2013 to 2012 or 14 but excluding the impact of foreign currency translation revenues increased 15 yearoveryear we held 64 events in 2013 consisting of 58 ongoing events and 6 new events compared to 62 events in 2012 the yearoveryear revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher exhibitor revenue at our ongoing events the overall number of attendees declined slightly while the number of exhibitors increased 11 average revenue per attendee rose 15 and average revenue per exhibitor increased 6 the gross contribution margin was flat yearoveryear at 46 

2012 versus 2011

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities for 2013 we had operating cash flow of 3157 million which was the highest in the company’s history and represented an increase of 13 over 2012 our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies revenues in our research segment which increased 12 in 2013 compared to 2012 constituted 71 and 70 of our total revenues in 2013 and 2012 respectively our research contracts generally renew annually and typically are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has generally resulted in strong growth in operating cash flow each year our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume 

  

in addition to the strong increase in our operating cash flows we also had almost 4240 million of cash and cash equivalents at yearend 2013 which was the highest cash balance in the company’s history we refinanced our debt in 2013 to take advantage of favorable market conditions and we had 5411 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at yearend 2013 we believe that our strong operating cash flow as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2013 2470 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the us approximately half of the cash and cash equivalents held overseas represents unremitted earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under us accounting rules no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the company intends to reinvest such funds overseas our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our us operations we intend to reinvest these earnings in our nonus operations except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result the company has not recognized additional income tax expense that may result from the remittance of these earnings however should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings we may be required to accrue additional taxes which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position cash flows and result of operations 

changes in cash and cash equivalents 

  

the following disclosure summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending december 31 2013 in thousands 

  



  

2013 versus 2012 

operating 

  

operating cash flow increased by 358 million or 13 when comparing 2013 to 2012 the increase was primarily due to higher net income in the 2013 period as well as additional receivable collections and other positive working capital changes these increases were partially offset by additional cash payments in the 2013 period for bonus commissions and taxes and we also had lower cash reimbursements in the 2013 period related to the completion of the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility 

investing 

  

cash used in our investing activities declined by 182 million in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease was primarily due to 103 million of cash used in 2012 for the acquisition of ideas international and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures in 2012 

  

capital expenditures were 365 million in 2013 compared to 443 million in 2012 which included 77 million and 170 million respectively that were paid for the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility the companys total expenditures on the renovation were approximately 342 million the company received a total of 250 million of reimbursements from the facility landlord for the renovation of which 30 million was received in 2013 130 million in 2012 and 90 million in 2011 which were recorded in operating cash flows

2012 versus 2011 

  

operating 

  

operating cash flow increased by 9 or 242 million in 2012 compared to 2011 which was primarily due to higher net income we also had lower cash payments for interest on our debt and other items as well as higher cash reimbursements related to the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility these increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash payments for income taxes during 2012 

  

investing 

  

cash used for investing purposes was 547 million in 2012 an increase in cash used of 127 million compared to 2011 due to 103 million of cash used for the acquisition of ideas international and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures

financing 

  

we used 1140 million less cash in our financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a lower number of shares repurchased cash used for share repurchases was 1113 million in 2012 compared to 2120 million in 2011 with 27 million and 59 million of shares repurchased respectively cash used also declined due to net debt activity as we borrowed an additional 50 million in 2012 compared to 201 million of debt repayments in 2011

recently issued accounting standards 

  

the fasb has issued new accounting rules which have not yet become effective these new rules are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311  presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists   asu 201311 asu 201311 addresses the balance sheet presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists asu 201311 requires that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward asu no 201311 is effective for the company’s fiscal quarter ending march 31 2014 and impacts balance sheet presentation only the company believes the balance sheet impact will not be material 

in march 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201305  parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity  asu no 201305 provides updated guidance to resolve diversity in practice concerning the release of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment into net income when a parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity when a company ceases to have a controlling financial interest the company should recognize any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary had resided upon a partial sale the company should release into earnings a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment asu no 201305 is effective for the company’s fiscal quarter ending march 31 2014 the guidance in asu 201305 will only impact the companys financial statements upon the occurrence of a transaction within its scope 

the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the company’s accounting and disclosures in future periods since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under our 2013 credit agreement at december 31 2013 we had 2000 million outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement which consisted of 1444 million  outstanding under the term loan and 556 million  outstanding under the revolver 

amounts borrowed under the 2013  credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to at gartner’s option either 1 the greatest of the administrative agent’s prime rate the average rate on overnight federal funds plus 12 of 1  and the eurodollar rate adjusted for statutory reserves plus 1  in each case plus a margin equal to between 025  and 075  depending on gartner’s leverage ratio as of the end of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended or 2 the eurodollar rate adjusted for statutory reserves plus a margin equal to between 125  and 175  depending on gartner’s leverage ratio as of the end of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended 

  

we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings in excess of 2000 million a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could change pretax annual interest expense on the additional revolver borrowing capacity under the 2013 credit agreement not including the expansion feature by approximately 09 million 

foreign currency risk 

  

for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 45 and 46 of our revenues respectively were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk 

  

translation risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact our operating results 

  

a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our condensed consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2013 we had almost 4240 million of cash and cash equivalents with approximately 58 denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the major currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2013 would have increased or decreased by approximately 200 million 

  

because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally 

  

transaction risk 

  

we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since foreign subsidiaries typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2013 we had 89 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately 610 million and an immaterial net unrealized loss substantially all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2014 

  

credit risk 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and an interest rate swap contract the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contract are with large investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the company’s 2013 credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 

intellectual property 

 

our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies software reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights we have policies related to confidentiality ownership and the use and protection of gartner’s intellectual property and we also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate that protect our intellectual property and we enforce these agreements if necessary

 

we recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify create and protect it additionally we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by our end users

 

employees 

 

we had 5468 employees as of december 31 2012 an increase of 10 compared to the prior year end as we continued to invest for future growth we have 976 employees located at our headquarters in stamford connecticut and a nearby office in trumbull connecticut 2198 employees located elsewhere in the united states and 2294 employees located outside of the united states our employees may be subject to collective bargaining agreements at a company or industry level in those foreign countries where this is part of the local labor law or practice we have experienced no work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be favorable

 item 1a risk factors 

 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

 

risks related to our business 

 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends in the us and abroad among these conditions are government deficit spending in the us and other countries ongoing uncertainty in global trade difficulties related to the refinancing of sovereign debt and currency stability in addition there continues to be risks related to one or more eurozone countries discontinuing the use of the euro as their currency these conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price

 

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results

 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position

 

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 70 and 69 of our revenues for 2012 and 2011 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected





our research subscription agreements are generally for twelve months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following

 

  

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 83 at december 31 2012 and 82 at december 31 2011 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals

 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 19 of our total revenues for 2012 and 21 for 2011 consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following

 

 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition

 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other occurrences impacting the global regional or national economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event and as the global economy recovers our ability to procure space for our events and keep associated costs down could become more challenging

 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive significant revenues from contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 2550 million and 2250 million respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments we believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at december 31 2012 will be filled in 2013 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause “termination for convenience” additionally many state governments their agencies and municipalities across the united states are under severe financial strain and are considering significant budget cuts should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues

 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results

 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase





expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted

 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in 85 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues are earned outside of the us our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent

 

our international operations expose us to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations

 

natural disasters or geopolitical events may disrupt our business a major weather event terrorist attack earthquake flood volcanic activity or other catastrophic disaster could significantly disrupt our operations such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing and business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions which may negatively impact our sales and increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results

 

internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems a cyberattack widespread internet failure or disruption of our critical information technology systems through viruses or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results

 

we take steps generally acknowledged as standard for the industry to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition andor operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences

 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers potentially harming our financial condition and operating results





our outstanding debt obligation could impact our financial condition or future operating results we have a credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the “2010 credit agreement” the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate which may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions at both december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a total of 2000 million outstanding under the 2010 credit agreement

 

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2010 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital

 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future

 

however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations

 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights

 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions

 

we face risks related to litigation we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected





we face risks related to taxation we operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions changes to the tax laws as well as the level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction may have an unfavorable impact upon the amount of taxes that we recognize in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business and in the ordinary course of business we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities from time to time these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes and resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts we have recorded additionally the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws or regulations a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a material impact on our business

 

risks related to our common stock 

 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline

 

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period as well as other factors outside of our control these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include

fluctuations in quarterly results

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below

 

the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s financial statements in future periods

 

our critical accounting policies are as follows

 

revenue recognition — revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows

 

  

  

  

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim

 

uncollectible fees receivable — we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts

 

the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands

 

 



goodwill and other intangible assets — the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following

 

  

  

  

  

  

the annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a qualitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty in 2012 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach based on this assessment the company believes the fair values of the company’s reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion

 

accounting for income taxes — as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made

 

accounting for stockbased compensation — the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 “sab no 107” and no 110 “sab no 110” the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stockbased compensation

 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period

 

restructuring and other accruals — we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved

 

we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end

cost of services and product development “cos” expense increased 8 in 2012 or 503 million to 6591 million compared to 6088 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business and to a lesser extent merit salary increases we also had higher conference costs and related travel expenses due to an increase in the number of events as well as additional attendees and exhibitors at our events these additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency cos as a percentage of revenues was 41 for both periods

 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased by 651 million in 2012 or 11 to 6788 million compared to 6137 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact the higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount and to a lesser extent higher sales commissions and merit salary increases the increased headcount includes additional quotabearing sales associates which increased to 1417 at december 31 2012 a 12 increase over the prior yearend

 

depreciation expense decreased slightly yearoveryear due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated which was only partially offset by the additional depreciation related to asset additions capital expenditures increased to 443 million in 2012 from 420 million in 2011 which includes 170 million and 95 million respectively of expenditures for the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility up to 250 million of these expenditures are reimbursable by the facility landlord and as of december 31 2012 220 million had been reimbursed

interest expense net declined by 11 in 2012 when compared to 2011 the decline was primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding which declined to 2070 million in 2012 from 2200 million in 2011 as well as lower amortization of capitalized debt refinancing costs

during 2012 the company closed the internal revenue service “irs” audit of its 2007 federal income tax return the resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations of the company

 

in 2011 the irs commenced an audit of the company’s federal income tax returns for the 2008 and 2009 tax years the irs has proposed adjustments for both 2008 and 2009 and the company expects to settle the audit in early 2013 although the audit has not been fully resolved the company believes that the ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations





the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “tax act” was enacted in january of 2013 and contains beneficial tax provisions for the company which apply retroactively to 2012 however since the tax act was passed in 2013 approximately 15 million of tax benefits relating to its retroactive application will be recorded by the company in the first quarter of 2013

 

net income was 1659 million in 2012 and 1369 million in 2011 an increase of 290 million or 21 primarily due to a higher operating income which was partially offset by 44 million in higher income tax charges although the yearoveryear effective tax rate declined pretax income increased substantially resulting in the higher dollar amount of tax charges both basic and diluted earnings per share increased 24 yearoveryear due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent a lower number of weightedaverage shares outstanding

cost of services and product development “cos” expense increased 10 in 2011 or 565 million to 6088 million compared to 5522 million in 2010 approximately half of the increase was due to higher payroll and related benefits costs resulting from our investment in additional headcount and merit salary increases the rest of the increase was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation as well as incremental expenses and additional investment in the events business cos as a percentage of revenues improved by 2 points yearoveryear primarily driven by higher research revenues and the operating leverage inherent in our research business

 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased by 705 million in 2011 or 13 to 6137 million from 5432 million in 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and to a lesser extent the negative impact of foreign currency translation excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange sga expense increased 11 yearoveryear the higher payroll costs resulted from additional investment in headcount as well as higher sales commissions and merit salary increases the increased headcount was primarily due to our investment in additional quotabearing sales associates which increased 21 compared to december 31 2010

the following sections present the results of our three business segments

 

research 

 

  

 

 

  

2012 versus 2011

 

research segment revenues increased 12 in 2012 compared to 2011 but excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation research segment revenues increased 14 the segment gross contribution margin increased by 1 point driven by higher revenues and the operating leverage in this business contribution margin improved in spite of a 10 increase in segment headcount as we continue to invest for future growth

 

research contract value increased 13 in 2012 to 12629 million but increased 14 yearoveryear excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation we had doubledigit contract value growth across all of our research product lines and client sizes and almost every industry group the number of research client organizations we serve increased by 7 in 2012 to 13305 and has increased 27 since 2009 we attribute the increase in contract value and the number of client organizations we serve to our extraordinary research content our continuing focus on sales effectiveness and the expansion in the number of our quotabearing sales associates both client retention and wallet retention remained strong during 2012 at 83 and 99 respectively

consulting 

 

  

 

 

  

2012 versus 2011

 

consulting revenues decreased 1 yearoveryear due to lower revenues in our contract optimization business contract optimization revenues which can fluctuate from period to period currently represent about 10 of total consulting segment revenues and have been declining over time as a percentage of overall segment revenue the decrease in contract optimization revenue was substantially offset by higher core consulting revenues which increased 5 yearoveryear driven by additional demand and increased headcount strategic advisory “sas” revenues were flat yearoveryear in accordance with our segment plan excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues increased 1 yearoveryear the gross contribution margin declined by 1 point due to the lower revenues in our contract optimization business which has a higher contribution margin than core consulting or sas backlog increased 2 yearoveryear to 1027 million at december 31 2012

 

2011 versus 2010

 

consulting revenues increased 2 yearoveryear primarily due to higher revenues in core consulting excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues were down slightly the gross contribution margin declined by 3 points due to lower utilization in core consulting and higher payroll and benefit costs resulting from merit salary increases and the full year impact in 2011 from the additional headcount we added in the fourth quarter of 2010 backlog was down slightly yearoveryear to 1006 million at december 31 2011

 

events 

 

  

 

 

 



2012 versus 2011

2011 versus 2010

 

events revenues increased 22 yearoveryear or 271 million excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues increased 21 we held 60 events in 2011 which consisted of 53 ongoing events and 7 new event launches compared to 56 events in 2010 we discontinued 3 events in 2011 that had been held in prior years the additional revenue we earned in 2011 was attributable to significantly higher revenue at our ongoing events with doubledigit increases in the number of attendees and exhibitors average revenue per attendee rose 2 and average revenue per exhibitor increased 5 for full year 2011 gross contribution margin decreased 1 point primarily due to incremental expenses and additional investment in the business to strengthen the portfolio and provide a foundation for future growth

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities for 2012 we had operating cash flow of 2798 million which was the highest in the company’s history and an increase of 9 over 2011 our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscriptionbased business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies revenues in our research segment which increased 12 in 2012 compared to 2011 constituted 70 and 69 of our total revenues in 2012 and 2011 respectively our research contracts generally renew annually and typically are paid in advance and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins has generally resulted in strong growth in operating cash flow each year our cash flow generation has also been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as the effective management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume

 

in addition to the strong increase in our operating cash flows we also had almost 3000 million of cash and cash equivalents at yearend 2012 which was the highest cash balance in the company’s history and 3470 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at yearend 2012 we believe that our strong operating cash flow as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs

 

the company’s 2010 credit agreement expires in december 2015 the company is currently exploring refinancing options to take advantage of favorable market conditions

 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2012 approximately 1670 million of our cash was held outside the us approximately half of the amount of cash held overseas represents unremitted earnings of our nonus subsidiaries under us accounting rules no provision for us federal and local taxes is required for these unremitted overseas earnings if the company intends to reinvest such funds overseas our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our us operations and as a result we intend to reinvest these earnings in our nonus operations except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been recorded for these unremitted earnings however should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings we may be required to accrue for us taxes as a result and these charges could be material and would be recorded in future periods

2012 versus 2011

quarterly financial data 

 

the following tables present our quarterly operating results for the two year period ended december 31 2012

 

  

  

 

 

recently issued accounting standards 

 

the fasb has issued new accounting rules which have not yet become effective these new rules are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods

 

other comprehensive income reclassifications  in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  the standard requires that public companies present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their financial statements in a single note or on the face of the financial statements public companies will also have to provide this information in both their annual and interim financial statements the new requirements will take effect for gartner beginning january 1 2013 and will be applied prospectively while the company has not completed its analysis of the new standard it believes the new rule may result in additional disclosures and changes to the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income

 

balance sheet offsetting  in december 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  the new guidance requires disclosures about assets and liabilities that are offset or have the potential to be offset under us gaap rules the new disclosure requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement in addition the standard requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements these disclosures are intended to address differences in the asset and liability offsetting requirements under us gaap and international financial reporting standards this new guidance will be effective for gartner for interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1 2013 with retrospective application required while the adoption of this new guidance may result in additional disclosures we do not expect it to have an impact on the company’s consolidated balance sheets 

 

the fasb also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the company’s accounting and disclosures in future periods since these rules have not yet been issued the effective dates and potential impact are unknown

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under our 2010 credit agreement at december 31 2012 we had 1500 million outstanding under the term loan and 500 million outstanding under the revolver borrowings under this facility are floating rate which may be either primebased or eurodollarbased the rate paid for these borrowings includes a base floating rate plus a margin between 050 and 125 on prime borrowings and between 150 and 225 on eurodollarbased borrowings

 

we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings in excess of 2000 million a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates could change pretax annual interest expense on the additional revolver borrowing capacity under the 2010 credit agreement not including the expansion feature by approximately 09 million





foreign currency risk 

 

approximately 46 of our revenues for both the fiscal years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the eurodollar the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk

 

translation risk

 

we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact our operating results

 

a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our condensed consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2012 we had almost 3000 million of cash and cash equivalents with approximately half denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the major currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2012 would have increased or decreased by approximately 120 million

 

because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally

 

transaction risk

 

we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since foreign subsidiaries typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2012 we had 68 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of 761 million and an immaterial net unrealized gain all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2013

 

credit risk

 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the company’s 2010 credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

 5 

 notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 i tem 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition 

and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

risks related to our business 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions both domestic and abroad the global credit crisis and economic recession that began in 2008 contributed to significant slowdowns and uncertainty in global trade and economic activity which continue through today in addition difficulties related to the refinancing of sovereign debt especially in europe could negatively and materially affect demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 69 and 67 of our revenues for 2011 and 2010 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription agreements are generally for twelve months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 7 

 additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 82 at december 31 2011 and 83 at december 31 2010 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 21 of our total revenues for 2011 and 23 for 2010 these consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event and as the global economy recovers our ability to procure space for our events and keep associated costs down could become more challenging 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive significant revenues from contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2011 and 2010 approximately 2250 million and 2100 million respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments we believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at december 31 2011 will be filled in 2012 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause “termination for convenience” additionally many state governments their agencies and municipalities across the united states are under severe financial strain and are considering significant budget cuts should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase 

expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in 85 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues are earned outside of the us 

our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

our international operations expose us to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

natural disasters or geopolitical events may disrupt our business a major weather event terrorist attack earthquake flood volcanic activity or other catastrophic disaster could significantly disrupt our operations such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing and business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city which was the site of a major terrorist attack in 2001 and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions which may negatively impact our sales and increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition andor operating results 

internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems a cyberattack widespread internet failure or disruption of our critical information technology systems through viruses or otherwise could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition andor operating results 

we take steps generally acknowledged as standard for the industry to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition andor operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers harming our operating results and financial condition 

our outstanding debt obligation could impact our financial condition or future operating results we have a credit agreement that provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate which may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions 

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the credit arrangement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

we face risks related to litigation we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation we operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction may have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we recognize in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business and in the ordinary course of business we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities from time to time these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes and resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts we have recorded additionally the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its examination of the federal income tax return of the company for the tax year ended december 31 2007 in december 2010 the company received a report of the audit findings the company disagrees with certain of the proposed adjustments and is disputing this matter through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate in addition in the second quarter of 2011 the irs commenced an audit of the company’s 2008 and 2009 tax years the company continues to comply with all information requests and no material adjustments of the company’s tax positions have been proposed at this time for the 2008 and 2009 tax years although the final resolution of these audits is uncertain and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts recorded the company believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws or regulations a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a material impact on our business 

risks related to our common stock 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline 

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market

 business measurements 

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 

 executive summary of operations and financial position 

we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive doubledigit annual revenue and earnings growth the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content deliver innovative and highly differentiated product offerings build a strong sales capability provide world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention and continuously improve our operational effectiveness 

we had total revenues of 14686 million in 2011 an increase of 14 over 2010 while diluted earnings per share increased by 43 per share to 139 revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business segments excluding the impact of foreign currency 2011 total revenues increased 11 over 2010 

research revenues rose 17 yearoveryear to 10121 million in 2011 which is the first time our research segment revenues have exceeded one billion dollars the contribution margin increased 2 points in 2011 to 67 at december 31 2011 research contract value was 11158 million the highest in the company’s history and an increase of 14 over december 31 2010 client retention was 82 and wallet retention was 99 at december 31 2011 consulting revenues increased 2 over 2010 while the gross contribution margin was 37 consultant utilization was 65 for 2011 and we had 481 billable consultants at december 31 2011 compared to 473 at yearend 2010 events revenues increased 22 compared to 2010 we held 60 events in 2011 four more than the prior year while attendance at our events increased 15 to 42748 the segment contribution margin was 45 for 2011 for a more detailed discussion of our segment results see segment results below 

gartner generated almost 2560 million of cash from operating activities in 2011 an increase of 24 over 2010 excluding the 90 million in landlord reimbursements we received in 2011 related to the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility which is recorded as an operating cash flow benefit our operating cash flow increased 20 yearoveryear we continued to focus on maximizing shareholder value in 2011 and we repurchased 59 million of our common shares outstanding which was approximately 6 of the total common shares outstanding at the beginning of 2011 

we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs in addition to our strong operating cash flow we refinanced our debt in late 2010 to take advantage of favorable financing conditions and to obtain greater financial flexibility and liquidity through a larger revolving credit facility the credit arrangement provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility as of december 31 2011 we had 1427 million of cash and cash equivalents and we had almost 3770 million of available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 

fluctuations in quarterly results 

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry general economic conditions and other factors the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s financial statements in future periods 

our critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition — revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

 17 

 the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

uncollectible fees receivable — we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands 

 goodwill and other intangible assets — the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following 

 since 2002 the us gaap goodwill impairment rules required a quantitative approach in which the fair values of our reporting units was determined based on estimates of future business results and market and economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201108 intangiblesgoodwill and other – testing goodwill for impairment “asu no 201108” asu no 201108 optionally permits an evaluation of goodwill based on a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount as a result of the issuance of asu no 201108 the required annual goodwill impairment test may now be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or both the annual determination of the estimated fair value of reporting unit goodwill whether quantitative or qualitative contains judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty 

in 2010 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing the quantitative approach and concluded that the fair values of each of the company’s reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values in 2011 we early adopted asu no 201108 and evaluated reporting unit goodwill utilizing a qualitative assessment based on this assessment the company believes the fair value of goodwill for each of the company’s reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying 

values and thus concluded that it was not necessary to conduct the twostep goodwill impairment test see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

accounting for income taxes — as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made 

accounting for stockbased compensation — the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 “sab no 107” and no 110 “sab no 110” the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

restructuring and other accruals — we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 

we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end

cost of services and product development “cos” expense increased 10 in 2011 or 565 million to 6088 million compared to 5522 million in 2010 approximately half of the increase was due to higher payroll and related benefits costs resulting from our investment in additional headcount and merit salary increases the rest of the increase was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation as well as incremental expenses and additional investment in the events business cost of services and product development as a percentage of revenues improved by 2 points yearoveryear primarily driven by higher research revenues and the operating leverage inherent in our research business 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased by 705 million in 2011 or 13 to 6137 million from 5432 million in 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll and to a lesser extent the negative impact of foreign currency translation excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange sga expense increased 11 yearoveryear the higher payroll costs resulted from additional investment in headcount as well as higher sales commissions and merit salary increases the increased headcount was primarily due to our investment in additional quotabearing sales associates which increased 21 compared to december 31 2010

notes to the consolidated financial statements excluding the 37 million incremental charge interest expense net declined approximately 15 yearoveryear primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding which declined to 2200 million in 2011 from 3260 million in 2010

cost of services and product development increased 11 in 2010 or 539 million to 5522 million compared to 4984 million in 2009 the impact of foreign currency on the yearoveryear increase was not significant we recognized 368 million in higher payroll commissions and related personnel costs in 2010 primarily due to the impact of the increased headcount from the amr research and burton group businesses we had 120 million in higher conference and travel costs in 2010 due to the additional events we held and increased attendees as well as a general increase in travel activity from the depressed 2009 levels when the company had strict travel restrictions in place due to the economic downturn we also had 22 million in higher equity compensation expense due to a higher level of achievement on performancebased stock units 

cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales was 43 in 2010 and 44 in 2009 a 1 point improvement primarily driven by the substantial increase in our fourth quarter 2010 revenues which increased 16 over the fourth quarter of 2009 and was substantially greater than the increase in the quarterly cost of services 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased by 662 million in 2010 or 14 to 5432 million from 4770 million in 2009 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange sga expense increased 13 yearoveryear we had 470 million of higher sales commissions payroll and benefits and other personnel charges in 2010 which included the additional headcount costs attributable to the amr research and burton group businesses we also had 43 million of additional stockbased compensation expense due to the higher level of achievement on performancebased stock units and higher travel charges of 71 million primarily due to additional sales headcount and the loosening of travel restrictions the unfavorable impact of foreign currency added 31 million of additional expense

operating income increased 11 yearoveryear to 1493 million in 2010 from 1345 million in 2009 the increase was due to the significantly higher gross contribution from our three business segments in 2010 which increased 15 yearoveryear to 7423 million in 2010 from 6429 million in 2009 the increased gross contribution was partially offset by higher charges in 2010 for sga as well as higher intangible amortization and acquisition and integration charges related to our acquisitions operating income as a percentage of revenues was 12 for both 2010 and 2009

events revenues increased 22 yearoveryear or 271 million excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues increased 21 yearoveryear we held 60 events in 2011 which consisted of 53 ongoing events and 7 new event launches compared to 56 events in 2010 we discontinued 3 events in 2011 that had been held in prior years 

the additional revenue we earned in 2011 was attributable to significantly higher revenue at our ongoing events with doubledigit increases in the number of attendees and exhibitors average revenue per attendee rose 2 and average revenue per exhibitor increased 5 events revenue was strong in the fourth quarter of 2011 rising to 764 million an increase of 22 over the fourth quarter of 2010 and the highest reported fourth quarter revenue in gartner history for full year 2011 gross contribution margin decreased 1 point primarily due to incremental expenses and additional investment in the business to strengthen the portfolio and provide a foundation for future growth 

2010 versus 2009 

events revenues increased 209 million in 2010 or 21 compared to 2009 with little impact from foreign currency translation we held 2 additional events in 2010 for a total of 56 events which consisted of 48 ongoing events and 8 new event launches we discontinued 6 events that had been held in prior years we had a 22 increase in attendees and a 24 increase in exhibitors while average revenue increased 12 for attendees but was down slightly for exhibitors revenues increased 211 million and 52 million from our ongoing and new events respectively which was partially offset by a 54 million revenue loss from discontinued events 

the gross contribution margin increased 5 points primarily due to higher contribution from our ongoing events reflecting the strength in attendee volume and average revenue per attendee as well as higher exhibitor volume 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our ongoing operating activities for 2011 we had operating cash flow of 2556 million which was the highest in the company’s history and an increase of 24 over 2010 as of december 31 2011 we had 1427 million of cash and cash equivalents and 3768 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2011 1230 million of our cash was held outside the us and approximately onethird of this amount represented unremitted earnings of nonus subsidiaries under us gaap accounting rules no provision for us federal and local taxes is required for these unremitted overseas earnings if the company intends to reinvest such funds overseas our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy our us liquidity needs and we intend to reinvest these earnings in our nonus operations except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been recorded for these unremitted earnings however should we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings we may be required to accrue for us taxes as a result and these charges could be material and would be recorded in future periods 

changes in cash and cash equivalents 

the following tables summarize the changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending december 31 2011 in thousands

2011 versus 2010 

operating 

operating cash flow increased by 24 or 501 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to 406 million in higher net income and approximately 150 million in lower cash payments for acquisition costs severance and other costs we also received 90 million in landlord cash reimbursements for capital expenditures on the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility these increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash bonus and commission payments we paid in 2011 due to our stronger financial performance excluding the 90 million in landlord reimbursements we received in 2011 related to the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility our operating cash flow increased 20 yearoveryear 

investing 

we used 81 million of additional cash in our investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher capital expenditures capital expenditures were 420 million in 2011 compared to 217 million in 2010 we also made 122 million in payments related to the acquisition of burton group in early 2010 which we acquired in december 2009 

the 420 million of capital expenditures in the 2011 period included 95 million we paid for the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility which is fully reimbursable by the landlord the company received reimbursement of 90 million of this amount in 2011 which is recorded as an operating cash flow benefit the company will receive the remaining 05 million landlord reimbursement in 2012 which will also be recorded as an operating cash flow benefit when received 

financing 

we used an additional 150 million of cash in our financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to additional share repurchases during 2011 we used 2120 million for share repurchases compared to 998 million in 2010 the increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2011 was substantially offset by lower debt repayments in 2011 compared to 2010 on a net basis we repaid 998 million of our debt in 2010 and we paid 48 million in fees related to our refinancing compared to 201 million of debt repayments in 2011 

2010 versus 2009 

operating 

operating cash flow increased by 436 million or 27 when comparing 2010 to 2009 primarily due to the 133 million yearoveryear increase in net income a 90 million decrease in cash payments for income taxes and a 121 million decrease in payments for severance interest payments on our debt and excess facilities we also received 24 million in cash in 2010 from an insurance recovery and approximately 198 million of improvements in our working capital accounts which included improved cash collection on our receivables partially offsetting these increases were 80 million in acquisition and integration payments made in 2010 related to the acquisitions of amr research and burton group and 50 million more in 2010 bonus payments 

investing 

cash used in our investing activities declined by 858 million in 2010 due to the acquisitions of amr research and burton group in 2009 we paid 1045 million in cash for these acquisitions in december 2009 and an additional 122 million in january 2010 we used 217 million of cash in 2010 for capital expenditures compared to 151 million in the 2009 period an increase of 66 million or 43 

financing 

cash used in our financing activities was 978 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 with a total of 1716 million used in 2010 compared to 738 million used in 2009 the additional cash used was due to higher debt repayments and additional share repurchases in 2010 

on a net basis we repaid 1088 million of debt in 2010 compared to 873 million in the prior year an increase in cash used of 216 million we used 998 million of cash for share repurchases in 2010 compared to 37 million in 2009 an increase in cash used of 961 million we also paid 48 million in cash in 2010 for fees related to our debt refinancing partially offsetting these higher uses of cash was an additional 247 million in cash realized from option exercises and excess tax benefits as a higher average stock price in 2010 resulted in a significantly increased number of option exercises 

obligations and commitments 

at december 31 2011 we had 2000 million outstanding under our 2010 credit agreement which provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the 2010 credit agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased at the company’s option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate the term loan will be repaid in 19 consecutive quarterly installments which commenced in march 2011 with the final payment due in december 2015 and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the company’s option the revolving credit facility may be used for loans and up to 400 million may be used for letters of credit the revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until december 2015 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid see note 5 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2010 credit agreement

quarterly financial data 

the following tables present our quarterly operating results for the two year period ended december 31 2011 

   recently issued accounting standards 

accounting guidance issued by the various standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective with respect to our consolidated financial statements are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements 

comprehensive income in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201105 comprehensive income topic 22010 presentation of comprehensive income  the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders’ equity instead the new rule will require an entity to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance this new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2011 the company will adopt this new rule in the quarter ending march 31 2012 while the adoption of this new guidance will change the presentation of comprehensive income it is not expected to have an impact on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position 

fair value measurements in may 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201104 fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu no 201104 establishes a number of new requirements for fair value measurements these include 1 a prohibition on grouping financial instruments for purposes of determining fair value except when an entity manages market and credit risks on the basis of the entity’s net exposure to the group 2 an extension of the prohibition against the use of a blockage factor to all fair value measurements that prohibition currently applies only to financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets and 3 a requirement that for recurring level 3 fair value measurements entities disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs a description of the valuation process used and qualitative details about the sensitivity of the measurements in addition for items not carried at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed entities will be required to disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy that applies to the fair value measurement disclosed this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 the company will adopt this new rule in the quarter ending march 31 2012 the adoption of this asu may result in additional fair value disclosures but is not expected to have an impact on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position 

i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under our 2010 credit agreement at december 31 2011 we had 1800 million outstanding under the term loan and 200 million outstanding under the revolver borrowings under this facility are floating rate which may be either primebased or eurodollarbased the rate paid for these borrowings includes a base floating rate plus a margin between 050 and 125 on prime borrowings and between 150 and 225 on eurodollarbased borrowings 

we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings in excess of 2000 million a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would change pretax annual interest expense on the additional revolver borrowing capacity under the 2010 credit agreement not including the expansion feature by approximately 09 million 

foreign currency risk 

we have customers in numerous countries and 46 and 44 of our revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk 

translation risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact our operating results 

a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our condensed consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2011 we had 1427 million of cash and cash equivalents a substantial portion of which was denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the major currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2011 would have increased or decreased by approximately 90 million 

because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally 

transaction risk 

we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since we typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates 

we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2011 we had 60 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of 996 million and an immaterial net unrealized gain all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2012 

credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the company’s 2010 credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

 5 

 notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

i tem 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following sections discuss many but not all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance but is not intended to be allinclusive any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations financial condition 

and cash flows and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

risks related to our business 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions both domestic and abroad the global credit crisis and economic recession that began in 2008 contributed to significant slowdowns and uncertainty in global trade and economic activity which continue through today in addition difficulties related to the refinancing of sovereign debt especially in europe could negatively and materially affect demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 69 and 67 of our revenues for 2011 and 2010 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription agreements are generally for twelve months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 7 

 additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 82 at december 31 2011 and 83 at december 31 2010 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 21 of our total revenues for 2011 and 23 for 2010 these consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event and as the global economy recovers our ability to procure space for our events and keep associated costs down could become more challenging 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive significant revenues from contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2011 and 2010 approximately 2250 million and 2100 million respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments we believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at december 31 2011 will be filled in 2012 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause “termination for convenience” additionally many state governments their agencies and municipalities across the united states are under severe financial strain and are considering significant budget cuts should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase 

expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in 85 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues are earned outside of the us 

our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

our international operations expose us to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

natural disasters or geopolitical events may disrupt our business a major weather event terrorist attack earthquake flood volcanic activity or other catastrophic disaster could significantly disrupt our operations such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing and business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city which was the site of a major terrorist attack in 2001 and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions which may negatively impact our sales and increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition andor operating results 

internet and critical internal computer system failures cyberattacks or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business a significant portion of our business is conducted over the internet and we rely heavily on computer systems a cyberattack widespread internet failure or disruption of our critical information technology systems through viruses or otherwise could cause delays in initiating or completing sales impede delivery of our products and services to our clients disrupt other critical clientfacing or business processes or dislocate our critical internal functions such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition andor operating results 

we take steps generally acknowledged as standard for the industry to secure our management information systems including our computer systems intranet proprietary websites email and other telecommunications and data networks and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services however the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems and those of our outside service providers may be vulnerable to theft loss damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events including unauthorized access or security breaches cyberattacks computer viruses power loss or other disruptive events our reputation brand financial condition andor operating results could be adversely affected if as a result of a significant cyber event or other technologyrelated catastrophe our operations are disrupted or shutdown our confidential proprietary information is stolen or disclosed we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer employee or other confidential information we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers harming our operating results and financial condition 

our outstanding debt obligation could impact our financial condition or future operating results we have a credit agreement that provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the credit arrangement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate which may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions 

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the credit arrangement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit arrangement the associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

we face risks related to litigation we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation we operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction may have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we recognize in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business and in the ordinary course of business we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities from time to time these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes and resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts we have recorded additionally the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its examination of the federal income tax return of the company for the tax year ended december 31 2007 in december 2010 the company received a report of the audit findings the company disagrees with certain of the proposed adjustments and is disputing this matter through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate in addition in the second quarter of 2011 the irs commenced an audit of the company’s 2008 and 2009 tax years the company continues to comply with all information requests and no material adjustments of the company’s tax positions have been proposed at this time for the 2008 and 2009 tax years although the final resolution of these audits is uncertain and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts recorded the company believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations we operate in a number of countries and as a result we are required to comply with numerous and in many cases changing international and us federal state and local laws and regulations as a result we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws employee training annual affirmations monitoring and enforcement however if any employee fails to comply with or intentionally disregards any of these laws or regulations a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the company including but not limited to significant penalties and fines sanctions andor litigation and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing any of which could have a material impact on our business 

risks related to our common stock 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline 

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours  to our knowledge as of the date of this report and based upon sec filings six institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include

 business measurements 

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 

 executive summary of operations and financial position 

we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive doubledigit annual revenue and earnings growth the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content deliver innovative and highly differentiated product offerings build a strong sales capability provide world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention and continuously improve our operational effectiveness 

we had total revenues of 14686 million in 2011 an increase of 14 over 2010 while diluted earnings per share increased by 43 per share to 139 revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business segments excluding the impact of foreign currency 2011 total revenues increased 11 over 2010 

research revenues rose 17 yearoveryear to 10121 million in 2011 which is the first time our research segment revenues have exceeded one billion dollars the contribution margin increased 2 points in 2011 to 67 at december 31 2011 research contract value was 11158 million the highest in the company’s history and an increase of 14 over december 31 2010 client retention was 82 and wallet retention was 99 at december 31 2011 consulting revenues increased 2 over 2010 while the gross contribution margin was 37 consultant utilization was 65 for 2011 and we had 481 billable consultants at december 31 2011 compared to 473 at yearend 2010 events revenues increased 22 compared to 2010 we held 60 events in 2011 four more than the prior year while attendance at our events increased 15 to 42748 the segment contribution margin was 45 for 2011 for a more detailed discussion of our segment results see segment results below 

gartner generated almost 2560 million of cash from operating activities in 2011 an increase of 24 over 2010 excluding the 90 million in landlord reimbursements we received in 2011 related to the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility which is recorded as an operating cash flow benefit our operating cash flow increased 20 yearoveryear we continued to focus on maximizing shareholder value in 2011 and we repurchased 59 million of our common shares outstanding which was approximately 6 of the total common shares outstanding at the beginning of 2011 

we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs in addition to our strong operating cash flow we refinanced our debt in late 2010 to take advantage of favorable financing conditions and to obtain greater financial flexibility and liquidity through a larger revolving credit facility the credit arrangement provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility as of december 31 2011 we had 1427 million of cash and cash equivalents and we had almost 3770 million of available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 

fluctuations in quarterly results 

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter as well as other events the amount of new business generated the mix between domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of our new products and services competition in the industry general economic conditions and other factors the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s financial statements in future periods 

our critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition — revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

 17 

 the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

uncollectible fees receivable — we maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands 

 goodwill and other intangible assets — the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following 

 since 2002 the us gaap goodwill impairment rules required a quantitative approach in which the fair values of our reporting units was determined based on estimates of future business results and market and economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201108 intangiblesgoodwill and other – testing goodwill for impairment “asu no 201108” asu no 201108 optionally permits an evaluation of goodwill based on a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount as a result of the issuance of asu no 201108 the required annual goodwill impairment test may now be either quantitative or qualitative in nature or both the annual determination of the estimated fair value of reporting unit goodwill whether quantitative or qualitative contains judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events as a result both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty 

in 2010 we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing the quantitative approach and concluded that the fair values of each of the company’s reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values in 2011 we early adopted asu no 201108 and evaluated reporting unit goodwill utilizing a qualitative assessment based on this assessment the company believes the fair value of goodwill for each of the company’s reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying 

values and thus concluded that it was not necessary to conduct the twostep goodwill impairment test see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

accounting for income taxes — as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made 

accounting for stockbased compensation — the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 “sab no 107” and no 110 “sab no 110” the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 8 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

restructuring and other accruals — we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 

we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end

cost of services and product development “cos” expense increased 10 in 2011 or 565 million to 6088 million compared to 5522 million in 2010 approximately half of the increase was due to higher payroll and related benefits costs resulting from our investment in additional headcount and merit salary increases the rest of the increase was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation as well as incremental expenses and additional investment in the events business cost of services and product development as a percentage of revenues improved by 2 points yearoveryear primarily driven by higher research revenues and the operating leverage inherent in our research business

interest expense net was 100 million in 2011 compared to 156 million in 2010 a 36 decline the 156 million of interest expense in 2010 included 37 million of incremental expense related to the refinancing of our debt see note 5 — debt in the 

notes to the consolidated financial statements excluding the 37 million incremental charge interest expense net declined approximately 15 yearoveryear primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding which declined to 2200 million in 2011 from 3260 million in 2010

provision for income taxes was 653 million in 2011 compared to 378 million in 2010 and the effective tax rate was 323 for 2011 compared to 282 for 2010 the lower effective tax rate in 2010 was primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowances relating to certain net operating losses 

net income was 1369 million in 2011 and 963 million in 2010 an increase of 406 million or 42 primarily due to a substantially higher operating income which was partially offset by higher income tax charges basic earnings per share increased 42 yearoveryear while diluted earnings per share increased 45 due to the higher net income

total revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 increased 1487 million or 13 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2009 revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business segments total revenues were also up 13 excluding the impact of foreign currency which had an immaterial impact yearoveryear

 an overview of our results by segment follows 

 please refer to the section of this mda below entitled “segment results” for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

cost of services and product development increased 11 in 2010 or 539 million to 5522 million compared to 4984 million in 2009 the impact of foreign currency on the yearoveryear increase was not significant we recognized 368 million in higher payroll commissions and related personnel costs in 2010 primarily due to the impact of the increased headcount from the amr research and burton group businesses we had 120 million in higher conference and travel costs in 2010 due to the additional events we held and increased attendees as well as a general increase in travel activity from the depressed 2009 levels when the company had strict travel restrictions in place due to the economic downturn we also had 22 million in higher equity compensation expense due to a higher level of achievement on performancebased stock units 

cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales was 43 in 2010 and 44 in 2009 a 1 point improvement primarily driven by the substantial increase in our fourth quarter 2010 revenues which increased 16 over the fourth quarter of 2009 and was substantially greater than the increase in the quarterly cost of services 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased by 662 million in 2010 or 14 to 5432 million from 4770 million in 2009 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange sga expense increased 13 yearoveryear we had 470 million of higher sales commissions payroll and benefits and other personnel charges in 2010 which included the additional headcount costs attributable to the amr research and burton group businesses we also had 43 million of additional stockbased compensation expense due to the higher level of achievement on performancebased stock units and higher travel charges of 71 million primarily due to additional sales headcount and the loosening of travel restrictions the unfavorable impact of foreign currency added 31 million of additional expense 

depreciation expense decreased slightly yearoveryear capital spending increased to 217 million in 2010 from 151 million in 2009 a 43 increase the company had reduced its capital expenditures in 2009 due to the economic downturn 

amortization of intangibles was 105 million in 2010 compared to 16 million in 2009 the increase was due to the amortization of the intangibles acquired from amr research and burton group 

acquisition and integration charges was 79 million in 2010 and 29 million in 2009 these charges related to the acquisitions of amr research and burton group and included legal consulting severance and other costs 

operating income increased 11 yearoveryear to 1493 million in 2010 from 1345 million in 2009 the increase was due to the significantly higher gross contribution from our three business segments in 2010 which increased 15 yearoveryear to 7423 million in 2010 from 6429 million in 2009 the increased gross contribution was partially offset by higher charges in 2010 for sga as well as higher intangible amortization and acquisition and integration charges related to our acquisitions operating income as a percentage of revenues was 12 for both 2010 and 2009 

please refer to the section of this mda entitled “segment results” below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

interest expense net was 156 million in 2010 and 160 million in 2009 a 3 decline the 2010 period includes 37 million of incremental expense related to the refinancing of our debt in december 2010 see note 5 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements excluding the 37 million incremental charge interest expense net would have declined approximately 26 yearoveryear due to lower average debt outstanding and a lower weightedaverage rate 

other expense income net was 04 million in 2010 which consisted of a 24 million gain for an insurance recovery related to a prior period loss offset by net foreign currency exchange losses the 29 expense in 2009 primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses 

provision for income taxes was 378 million in 2010 compared to 326 million in 2009 and the effective tax rate was 282 for both periods yearoveryear increases in the rate attributable to a higher financial statement cost of repatriation and higher net reserve increases were substantially offset by reductions in the rate yearoveryear attributable to larger releases of valuation allowances 

net income was 963 million in 2010 and 830 million in 2009 an increase of 133 million or 16 primarily due to a 148 million yearoveryear increase in operating income we also had a 04 million gain from other income expense activity in 2010 compared to a loss of 29 million in 2009 as well as slightly lower interest expense in 2010 these increases were partially offset by higher income tax charges in 2010 basic earnings per share increased 15 yearoveryear while diluted earnings per share increased 13 yearoveryear the increased earnings per share were due to the higher net income in 2010 which was slightly reduced by higher weightedaverage shares outstanding in 2010 

segment results 

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain cost of services and product development charges sga depreciation acquisition and 

integration charges and amortization of intangibles gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues 

the following sections present the results of our three segments 

research 

  2011 versus 2010 

research segment revenues increased 17 in 2011 compared to 2010 and reached the one billion dollar level for the first time research revenues increased across all of our regions products and client types excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation research segment revenues increased 14 the segment gross contribution margin increased by 2 points to 67 as higher segment revenues and the operating leverage in this business resulted in a higher segment contribution contribution margin improved in spite of an 8 increase in headcount to deliver on revenue growth and new clients 

research contract value increased 14 in 2011 to 11158 million which is the highest reported contract value in the company’s history foreign currency translation had an immaterial impact yearoveryear on contract value we had doubledigit contract value growth in most of our research product lines client sizes and industry groups with the number of research client organizations we serve up 20 since 2009 we attribute the increase in contract value to our extraordinary research content our continuing focus on sales effectiveness and the expansion in the number of our quotabearing sales associates both client retention and wallet retention remained strong at 82 and 99 respectively 

2010 versus 2009 

research revenues increased 15 in 2010 but excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation revenues increased 14 approximately 39 of the 1125 million revenue increase was attributable to the amr research and burton group businesses the segment gross contribution margin was flat at 65 despite additional headcount expenses from the amr research and burton group businesses research contract value was 9777 million at december 31 2010 an increase of 25 compared to december 31 2009 excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation research contract value increased 20 over 2009 the amr research and burton group businesses contributed approximately 30 of the increase in contract value client retention and wallet retention improved 5 points and 11 points respectively 

consulting 

  2011 versus 2010 

consulting revenues increased 2 yearoveryear primarily due to higher revenues in core consulting excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues were down slightly the gross contribution margin declined by 3 points due to lower utilization in core consulting and higher payroll and benefit costs resulting from merit salary increases and the full year impact in 2011 from the additional headcount we added in the fourth quarter of 2010 backlog was down slightly yearoveryear to 1006 million at december 31 2011 

2010 versus 2009 

consulting revenues increased 5 in 2010 but excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues increased 6 the amr research and burton group businesses added approximately 35 of the revenue increase the gross contribution margin improved by 1 point primarily due to additional revenues in our contract optimization and sas businesses which have higher margins than core consulting consulting billable headcount was 473 at december 31 2010 an increase of 7 from yearend 2009 with the majority of the additional headcount added in the fourth quarter of 2010 backlog increased 11 yearoveryear with increases across all of our geographic regions 

events 

  2011 versus 2010 

events revenues increased 22 yearoveryear or 271 million excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues increased 21 yearoveryear we held 60 events in 2011 which consisted of 53 ongoing events and 7 new event launches compared to 56 events in 2010 we discontinued 3 events in 2011 that had been held in prior years 

the additional revenue we earned in 2011 was attributable to significantly higher revenue at our ongoing events with doubledigit increases in the number of attendees and exhibitors average revenue per attendee rose 2 and average revenue per exhibitor increased 5 events revenue was strong in the fourth quarter of 2011 rising to 764 million an increase of 22 over the fourth quarter of 2010 and the highest reported fourth quarter revenue in gartner history for full year 2011 gross contribution margin decreased 1 point primarily due to incremental expenses and additional investment in the business to strengthen the portfolio and provide a foundation for future growth 

2010 versus 2009 

events revenues increased 209 million in 2010 or 21 compared to 2009 with little impact from foreign currency translation we held 2 additional events in 2010 for a total of 56 events which consisted of 48 ongoing events and 8 new event launches we discontinued 6 events that had been held in prior years we had a 22 increase in attendees and a 24 increase in exhibitors while average revenue increased 12 for attendees but was down slightly for exhibitors revenues increased 211 million and 52 million from our ongoing and new events respectively which was partially offset by a 54 million revenue loss from discontinued events 

the gross contribution margin increased 5 points primarily due to higher contribution from our ongoing events reflecting the strength in attendee volume and average revenue per attendee as well as higher exhibitor volume 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our ongoing operating activities for 2011 we had operating cash flow of 2556 million which was the highest in the company’s history and an increase of 24 over 2010 as of december 31 2011 we had 1427 million of cash and cash equivalents and 3768 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world at december 31 2011 1230 million of our cash was held outside the us and approximately onethird of this amount represented unremitted earnings of nonus subsidiaries under us gaap accounting rules no provision for us federal and local taxes is required for these unremitted overseas earnings if the company intends to reinvest such funds overseas our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our us operations or otherwise satisfy our us liquidity needs and we intend to reinvest these earnings in our nonus operations except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax as a result no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been recorded for these unremitted earnings however should we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings we may be required to accrue for us taxes as a result and these charges could be material and would be recorded in future periods 

changes in cash and cash equivalents 

the following tables summarize the changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending december 31 2011 in thousands 

 26 

2011 versus 2010 

operating 

operating cash flow increased by 24 or 501 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to 406 million in higher net income and approximately 150 million in lower cash payments for acquisition costs severance and other costs we also received 90 million in landlord cash reimbursements for capital expenditures on the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility these increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash bonus and commission payments we paid in 2011 due to our stronger financial performance excluding the 90 million in landlord reimbursements we received in 2011 related to the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility our operating cash flow increased 20 yearoveryear 

investing 

we used 81 million of additional cash in our investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher capital expenditures capital expenditures were 420 million in 2011 compared to 217 million in 2010 we also made 122 million in payments related to the acquisition of burton group in early 2010 which we acquired in december 2009 

the 420 million of capital expenditures in the 2011 period included 95 million we paid for the renovation of our stamford headquarters facility which is fully reimbursable by the landlord the company received reimbursement of 90 million of this amount in 2011 which is recorded as an operating cash flow benefit the company will receive the remaining 05 million landlord reimbursement in 2012 which will also be recorded as an operating cash flow benefit when received 

financing 

we used an additional 150 million of cash in our financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to additional share repurchases during 2011 we used 2120 million for share repurchases compared to 998 million in 2010 the increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2011 was substantially offset by lower debt repayments in 2011 compared to 2010 on a net basis we repaid 998 million of our debt in 2010 and we paid 48 million in fees related to our refinancing compared to 201 million of debt repayments in 2011 

2010 versus 2009 

operating 

operating cash flow increased by 436 million or 27 when comparing 2010 to 2009 primarily due to the 133 million yearoveryear increase in net income a 90 million decrease in cash payments for income taxes and a 121 million decrease in payments for severance interest payments on our debt and excess facilities we also received 24 million in cash in 2010 from an insurance recovery and approximately 198 million of improvements in our working capital accounts which included improved cash collection on our receivables partially offsetting these increases were 80 million in acquisition and integration payments made in 2010 related to the acquisitions of amr research and burton group and 50 million more in 2010 bonus payments 

investing 

cash used in our investing activities declined by 858 million in 2010 due to the acquisitions of amr research and burton group in 2009 we paid 1045 million in cash for these acquisitions in december 2009 and an additional 122 million in january 2010 we used 217 million of cash in 2010 for capital expenditures compared to 151 million in the 2009 period an increase of 66 million or 43 

financing 

cash used in our financing activities was 978 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 with a total of 1716 million used in 2010 compared to 738 million used in 2009 the additional cash used was due to higher debt repayments and additional share repurchases in 2010 

on a net basis we repaid 1088 million of debt in 2010 compared to 873 million in the prior year an increase in cash used of 216 million we used 998 million of cash for share repurchases in 2010 compared to 37 million in 2009 an increase in cash used of 961 million we also paid 48 million in cash in 2010 for fees related to our debt refinancing partially offsetting these higher uses of cash was an additional 247 million in cash realized from option exercises and excess tax benefits as a higher average stock price in 2010 resulted in a significantly increased number of option exercises 

obligations and commitments 

at december 31 2011 we had 2000 million outstanding under our 2010 credit agreement which provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the 2010 credit agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased at the company’s option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate the term loan will be repaid in 19 consecutive quarterly installments which commenced in march 2011 with the final payment due in december 2015 and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the company’s option the revolving credit facility may be used for loans and up to 400 million may be used for letters of credit the revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until december 2015 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid see note 5 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2010 credit agreement

quarterly financial data 

the following tables present our quarterly operating results for the two year period ended december 31 2011 

   recently issued accounting standards 

accounting guidance issued by the various standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective with respect to our consolidated financial statements are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements 

comprehensive income in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201105 comprehensive income topic 22010 presentation of comprehensive income  the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders’ equity instead the new rule will require an entity to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance this new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2011 the company will adopt this new rule in the quarter ending march 31 2012 while the adoption of this new guidance will change the presentation of comprehensive income it is not expected to have an impact on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position 

fair value measurements in may 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201104 fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu no 201104 establishes a number of new requirements for fair value measurements these include 1 a prohibition on grouping financial instruments for purposes of determining fair value except when an entity manages market and credit risks on the basis of the entity’s net exposure to the group 2 an extension of the prohibition against the use of a blockage factor to all fair value measurements that prohibition currently applies only to financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets and 3 a requirement that for recurring level 3 fair value measurements entities disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs a description of the valuation process used and qualitative details about the sensitivity of the measurements in addition for items not carried at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed entities will be required to disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy that applies to the fair value measurement disclosed this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 the company will adopt this new rule in the quarter ending march 31 2012 the adoption of this asu may result in additional fair value disclosures but is not expected to have an impact on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position 

i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under our 2010 credit agreement at december 31 2011 we had 1800 million outstanding under the term loan and 200 million outstanding under the revolver borrowings under this facility are floating rate which may be either primebased or eurodollarbased the rate paid for these borrowings includes a base floating rate plus a margin between 050 and 125 on prime borrowings and between 150 and 225 on eurodollarbased borrowings 

we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings in excess of 2000 million a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would change pretax annual interest expense on the additional revolver borrowing capacity under the 2010 credit agreement not including the expansion feature by approximately 09 million 

foreign currency risk 

we have customers in numerous countries and 46 and 44 of our revenues for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk 

translation risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact our operating results 

a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our condensed consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2011 we had 1427 million of cash and cash equivalents a substantial portion of which was denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the major currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2011 would have increased or decreased by approximately 90 million 

because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally 

transaction risk 

we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since we typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates 

we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2011 we had 60 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of 996 million and an immaterial net unrealized gain all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2012 

credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the company’s 2010 credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future additionally we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 item 1a risk factors 

 

we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions you should carefully consider the following risk factors and those set forth in our most recent annual report on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement see “available information” you should also carefully consider all of the other information in this prospectus supplement or incorporated by reference herein any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects results of operations and financial condition and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment 

 

risks related to our business 

 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by general economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions both domestic and abroad the severe tightening of the credit markets significant bankruptcies and other disruptions in the financial markets and the global economic recession that began in 2008 contributed to significant slowdowns and uncertainty in global trade and economic activity although global credit and general economic conditions have improved continuing difficulties in the financial markets and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the global economic recovery could negatively and materially affect demand for our products and services such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

 

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our 

products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

 

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 67 and 66 of our revenues for 2010 and 2009 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

 

our research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

  

additionally as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while our research client retention rate was 83 at december 31 2010 and 78 at december 31 2009 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 23 of our total revenues for 2010 and 25 for 2009 these consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

  

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes 

transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event and as the global economy recovers our ability to procure space for our events and keep associated costs down could become more challenging 

 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive significant revenues from contracts with the us government and its respective agencies numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2010 and 2009 approximately 2100 million and 1820 million respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments we believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at december 31 2010 will be filled in 2011 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause “termination for convenience” additionally many state governments their agencies and municipalities across the united states are under severe financial strain and are considering significant budget cuts should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues 

 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in 85 countries and 44 and 45 of our revenues for 2010 and 2009 respectively were derived from sales outside of the us 

 

our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

 

our international operations expose us to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations or our ability to deliver our research content over the internet in the event of a major weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida in a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our operating results abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients 

 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers harming our operating results and financial condition 

 

our outstanding debt obligations could impact our financial condition or future operating results in december 2010 we refinanced our debt by entering into a new credit agreement that provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the “2010 credit agreement” the 2010 credit agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased at our option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate which may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions 

 

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the 2010 credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit agreement 

 

the associated debt service costs of the borrowing arrangement under our 2010 credit agreement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our needs 

 

however we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries particularly in emerging markets do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts additionally there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business additionally we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions 

 

we face risks related to litigation we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 

 

we face risks related to taxation we operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction may have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we recognize in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business and in the ordinary course of business we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities from time to time 

 

these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes and resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts we have recorded additionally the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

 

risks related to our common stock 

 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline 

 

our stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market 

 

as of december 31 2010 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under these plans was approximately 90 million shares approximately 35 million of which have vested in addition approximately 70 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable without further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours  to our knowledge as of the date of this report and based upon sec filings seven institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock additionally a representative of valueact capital master fund lp “valueact capital” presently holds one seat on our board of directors 

 

while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders 

 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include 

 

  

these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

we have three business segments research consulting and events 

 

 

 

 

business measurements 

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 

 

executive summary of operations and financial position 

the cornerstones of our growth strategy are to focus on producing extraordinary research content deliver innovative and highly differentiated product offerings enhance our sales capability provide world class client service and improve our operational effectiveness 

we had total revenues of 12885 million in 2010 an increase of 13 over the prior year while diluted earnings per share increased by 11 per share to 096 revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business segments total revenues were also up 13 excluding the impact of foreign currency 

research revenues rose 15 yearoveryear to 86500 million in 2010 while the contribution margin was flat at 65 at december 31 2010 research contract value was almost 9780 million the highest in the company’s history and an increase of 25 over december 31 2009 client retention was 83 and wallet retention was 98 at december 31 2010 

consulting revenues increased 5 over 2009 while the gross contribution margin improved by 1 point consultant utilization was 68 for 2010 the same as 2009 we had 473 billable consultants at december 31 2010 

events revenues increased 21 compared to 2009 we held 56 events in 2010 two more than the prior year and attendance at our events increased 22 to 37219 the segment contribution margin was 46 for 2010 an increase of 5 points over 2009 

for a more detailed discussion of our segment results see segment results below 

we refinanced our debt in late 2010 to take advantage of favorable financing conditions and to obtain greater financial flexibility and liquidity through a larger revolving credit facility the new credit arrangement provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility 

gartner generated over 2050 million of cash from operating activities in 2010 we had 1202 million of cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2010 and we had 3760 million of available borrowing capacity under our new revolving credit facility we believe we have a strong cash position and liquidity 

fluctuations in quarterly results 

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series that normally are held during the fourth calendar quarter and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in the industry and other factors the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below 

the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s financial statements in future periods 

our critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition — we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

 

 

 

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

for those government contracts that permit cancellation historically we only recorded fees receivables to the extent amounts were earned and deferred revenue to the extent cash was received as of september 30 2010 based on an analysis of historic contract cancellations we determined that the likelihood of such cancellations was remote accordingly as of that date we record the entire billable contract amount as fees receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount to deferred revenue consistent with other contracts this change in estimate had an immaterial impact 

uncollectible fees receivable — the allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses 

and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands 

 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets — the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis 

our annual goodwill assessment requires us to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge for a portion of the associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in our financial statements 

factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty and as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

we completed the required annual goodwill impairment testing in the quarter ended september 30 2010 and concluded that the fair values of each of the company’s reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values in addition management concluded that none of the goodwill impairment triggers discussed above occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 see note 1 — business and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional goodwill disclosures 

accounting for income taxes — as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that 

we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made 

accounting for stockbased compensation — the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 “sab no 107” and no 110 “sab no 110” the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 9 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

restructuring and other accruals — we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 

we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end

please refer to the section of this mda below entitled “segment results” for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

cost of services and product development “cos” increased 11 in 2010 or 539 million to 5522 million compared to 4984 million in 2009 the impact of foreign currency on the yearoveryear increase was not significant we recognized 368 million in higher payroll commissions and related personnel costs in 2010 primarily due to the impact of the increased headcount from the amr research and burton group businesses we had 120 million in higher conference and travel costs in 2010 due to the additional events we held and increased attendees as well as a general increase in travel activity from the depressed 2009 levels when the company had strict travel restrictions in place due to the economic downturn we also had 22 million in higher equity compensation expense due to a higher level of achievement on performancebased stock units 

cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales was 43 in 2010 and 44 in 2009 a 1 point improvement primarily driven by the substantial increase in our fourth quarter 2010 revenues which increased 16 over the fourth quarter of 2009 and was substantially greater than the increase in the quarterly cost of services the improvement reflects the operating leverage of our business model 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased by 662 million in 2010 or 14 to 5432 million from 4770 million in 2009 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange sga expense increased 13 yearoveryear we had 470 million of higher sales commissions payroll and benefits and other personnel charges in 2010 which included the additional headcount costs attributable to the amr research and burton group businesses we also had 43 million of additional stockbased compensation expense due to the higher level of achievement on performancebased stock units and higher travel charges of 71 million primarily due to additional sales headcount and the loosening of travel restrictions the unfavorable impact of foreign currency added 31 million of additional expense 

depreciation expense decreased slightly yearoveryear capital spending increased to 217 million in 2010 from 151 million in 2009 a 43 increase the company had reduced its capital expenditures in 2009 due to the economic downturn 

amortization of intangibles was 105 million in 2010 compared to 16 million in 2009 the increase is due to the amortization of the intangibles acquired from amr research and burton group 

acquisition and integration charges was 79 million in 2010 and 29 million in 2009 included is these charges are legal fees and consultant fees in connection with the acquisitions and integration of amr research and burton group as well as severance costs related to redundant headcount 

operating income increased 11 yearoveryear to 1493 million in 2010 from 1345 million in 2009 the increase was due to the significantly higher gross contribution from our three business segments in 2010 which increased 15 yearoveryear to 7423 million in 2010 from 6429 million in 2009 the increased gross contribution was partially offset by higher charges in 2010 for sga as well as higher intangible amortization and acquisition and integration charges related to our acquisitions operating income as a percentage of revenues was 12 for both 2010 and 2009 

please refer to the section of this mda entitled “segment results” below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

interest expense net was 156 million in 2010 and 160 million in 2009 a 3 decline the 2010 period includes 37 million of incremental expense related to the refinancing of our debt in december 2010 see note 6 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements excluding the 37 million incremental charge interest expense net would have declined approximately 26 yearoveryear due to lower average debt outstanding and a lower weightedaverage rate 

other income expense net was 04 million in 2010 and consisted of a 24 million gain for an insurance recovery related to a prior period loss offset by net foreign currency exchange losses the 29 expense in 2009 primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses 

provision for income taxes was 378 million in 2010 compared to 326 million in 2009 and the effective tax rate was 282 for both periods yearoveryear increases in the rate attributable to higher financial statement cost of repatriation and higher net reserve increases were substantially offset by reductions in the rate year over year attributable to larger releases of valuation allowances 

the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its examination of the federal income tax return of the company for the tax year ended december 31 2007 in december 2010 the company received a report of the audit findings the company disagrees with certain of the proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously dispute this matter through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate the company believes that it has recorded reserves sufficient to cover exposures related to these issues however the resolution of such matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts recorded although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain we believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

net income was 963 million in 2010 and 830 million in 2009 an increase of 133 million or 16 primarily due to a 148 million yearoveryear increase in operating income we also had a 04 million gain from other income expense activity in 2010 compared to a loss of 29 million in 2009 as well as slightly lower interest expense in 2010 these increases were partially offset by higher income tax charges in 2010 

basic earnings per share increased 15 yearoveryear while diluted earnings per share increased 13 yearoveryear the increased earnings per share were due to the higher net income in 2010 which was slightly reduced by higher weightedaverage shares outstanding in 2010 

2009 versus 2008 

total revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 decreased 1393 million or 11 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2008 revenues declined across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business segments the impact of foreign currency had a negative impact on our revenues in 2009 and excluding this impact total revenues in 2009 were down 8 compared to 2008 our revenues and operating results were negatively impacted by global economic conditions in 2009

an overview of our results by segment follows 

 

please refer to the section of this mda below entitled “segment results” for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

cost of services and product development decreased 738 million yearoveryear or 13 the favorable impact of foreign currency translation reduced expense by about 190 million we had lower conference expenses of 185 million primarily due to discontinued events we also had reduced travel and internal meeting charges of 167 million and lower personnel costs of about 125 million primarily due to our tight cost controls the remaining 71 million net decrease was spread across a number of other expense categories cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales declined by 1 point to 44 in 2009 from 45 in 2008 primarily due to tight expense controls across our businesses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense decreased by about 380 million in 2009 or 7 compared to 2008 despite increasing our sales force the impact of foreign currency translation reduced expense by about 180 million we also had lower travel internal meeting and recruiting costs of about 190 million again due to our tight cost controls the remaining net reduction was spread across a number of other expense categories excluding the 60 sales associates that joined us from amr research and burton group we had 942 quotabearing sales associates at december 31 2009 a 2 increase from the prior year end this additional investment in sales associates resulted in 90 million of higher payroll and benefits costs which was offset by lower ga charges 

depreciation expense decreased 2 yearoveryear which reflects reduced capital spending during 2009 capital spending decreased to 151 million in 2009 from 243 million in 2008 a 38 decline which reflects the company’s reduced 2009 capital expenditures 

amortization of intangibles was 16 million for both 2009 and 2008 

acquisition and integration charges was 29 million in 2009 and zero in 2008 included is these charges are legal fees and consultant fees in connection with the acquisitions and integration of amr research and burton group as well as severance costs related to redundant headcount 

operating income decreased 18 yearoveryear to 1345 million in 2009 from 1644 million in 2008 operating income as a percentage of revenues declined 1 point yearoveryear primarily due to lower profitability in our consulting and events segments and the 29 million acquisition and integration charge related to amr research and burton group 

please refer to the section of this mda entitled “segment results” below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

interest expense net was 160 million in 2009 and 193 million in 2008 a 17 decline the 2009 period includes 11 million of expense related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting on an interest rate swap contract see note 6 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements excluding the 11 million charge interest expense net would have declined approximately 22 yearoveryear the yearoveryear decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in the weightedaverage amount of debt outstanding 

other expense income net of 29 million in 2009 consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses the 04 million other expense in 2008 primarily consisted of a 12 million gain related to the settlement of a litigation matter offset by net foreign currency exchange losses 

provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 326 million in 2009 as compared to 476 million in 2008 the effective tax rate was 282 in 2009 and 329 in 2008 the lower effective tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 is attributable to several items the most significant of these items include the following a the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions relating to the expiration of statutes of limitation was larger in 2009 than in 2008 while pretax income was lower and b differences relating to the taxability of life insurance contracts yearoveryear 

income from discontinued operations net of taxes includes the results of the company’s vision events business which we sold in early 2008 the 67 million of income for 2008 includes a net gain on sale of approximately 71 million and a 04 million operating loss 

net income was 830 million in 2009 and 1039 million in 2008 a decline of 209 million or 20 the decline was primarily driven by the reduced contributions by our three business segments in the 2009 period and to a lesser extent the 29 million acquisition and integration charge we recorded related to amr research and burton group these decreases were partially offset by lower sga charges a lower effective income tax rate and reduced interest expense also contributing to the yearoveryear decline in net income was the 67 million net gain from the sale of the company’s former vision events business recorded in the 2008 period 

basic earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 14 yearoveryear diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 13 yearoveryear 

segment results 

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain cost of services and product development charges and sga depreciation acquisition and integration charges amortization of intangibles and other charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues 

the following sections present the results of our three segments 

research 

 

 

 25 

2010 versus 2009 

research revenues increased 15 in 2010 but excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation revenues increased 14 approximately 39 of the 1125 million revenue increase was attributable to the amr research and burton group businesses the segment gross contribution margin was flat at 65 despite additional headcount expenses from the amr research and burton group businesses 

research contract value was 9777 million at december 31 2010 an increase of 25 compared to december 31 2009 and the highest reported contract value in the company’s history excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation research contract value increased 20 over 2009 we attribute the increase to our continuing focus on sales effectiveness and the improving economic environment the increase is also due to the amr research and burton group businesses which contributed approximately 30 of the 1933 million increase in contract value client retention and wallet retention improved 5 points and 11 points respectively 

2009 versus 2008 

research revenues declined 4 yearoveryear but excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation research revenues were down about 1 

in spite of lower revenues the research contribution margin increased 2 points yearoveryear the improved margin was primarily driven by tight cost controls which resulted in lower costs concentrated in personnel travel and internal meetings and our ability to implement price increases for our products 

contract value decreased 6 when comparing december 31 2009 to december 31 2008 but excluding the impact of foreign currency translation contract value was down 1 yearoveryear 

while down yearoveryear contract value increased 420 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 or 6 with growth across all industries geographies and client sizes we believe the increase reflects both improved sales effectiveness as well as an improving economic environment 

consulting 

 

 

 26 

2010 versus 2009 

consulting revenues increased 5 in 2010 but excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues increased 6 the amr research and burton group businesses added approximately 35 of the 153 million revenue increase the gross contribution margin improved by 1 point primarily due to additional revenues in our contract optimization and sas businesses both of which have higher margins than core consulting 

consulting billable headcount was 473 at december 31 2010 an increase of 7 yearoveryear backlog was 1008 million at december 31 2010 and increase of 99 million or 11 over the prior year backlog increased across all of our geographic regions the amr research and burton group businesses added approximately 03 million of the increase 

2009 versus 2008 

consulting revenues declined 17 when comparing 2009 with 2008 with the majority of the decline in core consulting and to a lesser extent in our sas and contract optimization businesses the decline in core consulting was driven by lower headcount utilization and billing rates the decline in revenue in our contract optimization business reflects a large contract received at the end of 2008 which was not repeated in 2009 sas revenues declined due to approximately 17 fewer fulfilled sas days excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency overall consulting revenues were down about 15 

the 2 point decline in the consulting contribution margin reflects lower revenue in our sas and contract optimization businesses which have higher margins than core consulting to a lesser extent the decline also reflects lower utilization and billing rates in core consulting 

we ended 2009 with 442 billable consultants a decline of 11 from the prior year end as we tightly managed resources to match demand the decline reflects normal attrition as well as the termination of approximately 30 consultants in january 2009 to better align our delivery resources with lower backlog 

consulting backlog declined 6 yearoveryear but increased 7 sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 909 million as demand for our consulting services was solid in the us while demand in europe lagged 

events 

 

 

 2010 versus 2009 

events revenues increased 209 million in 2010 or 21 compared to 2009 with little impact from foreign currency translation we held 2 additional events in 2010 for a total of 56 events which consisted of 48 ongoing events and 8 new event launches we 

discontinued 6 events that had been held in prior years we had a 22 increase in attendees and a 24 increase in exhibitors while average revenue increased 12 for attendees but was down slightly for exhibitors revenues increased 211 million and 52 million from our ongoing and new events respectively which was partially offset by a 54 million revenue loss from discontinued events 

the gross contribution margin increased 5 points primarily due to higher contribution from our ongoing events reflecting the strength in attendee volume and average revenue per attendee as well as higher exhibitor volume 

2009 versus 2008 

events revenue was down 496 million or 33 in 2009 due to the impact of discontinued events and a decline in revenue from our ongoing events we held 54 events in 2009 a decline of 16 events compared to the prior year the 54 events held in 2009 consisted of 51 ongoing events and 3 new events the number of attendees at our 51 ongoing events was down 12 while the number of exhibitors was down 31 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency events revenues were down 32 yearoveryear 

approximately 240 million of the revenue decrease was due to 19 discontinued events including our spring symposium which was a significant event in prior years we discontinued these events in 2009 in response to the difficult operating environment with tight travel restrictions and budget cuts at many companies due to the weak economy we also had a 300 million decline in revenue from our 51 ongoing events these declines were slightly offset by approximately 40 million in higher revenue from new event launches and other miscellaneous events revenues the events contribution margin was down 2 points yearoveryear primarily due to lower average attendee and exhibitor revenue at our 51 ongoing events 

while the number of attendees was down significantly yearoveryear this trend began to show improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 with attendance at our ongoing events up 2 we also began to see improvement in exhibitor participation we believe these trends reflect a loosening of corporate travel budgets resumed growth in marketing spend by technology companies and our continuing efforts to increase client retention by enhancing the value and experience that our clients derive from our events 

liquidity and capital resources 

on december 22 2010 the company entered into a new credit facility with a syndication of banks led by jpmorgan chase to take advantage of favorable financing conditions and to obtain greater financial flexibility and liquidity through a larger revolving credit facility the new credit arrangement provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the new credit facility contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased at the company’s option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate 

we finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our ongoing operating activities and our 2010 operating cash flow increased 27 over the prior year as of december 31 2010 we had 1202 million of cash and cash equivalents and 3760 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately 75 held outside the united states as of december 31 2010 

we believe that we have adequate liquidity and that the cash we expect to earn from our ongoing operating activities our existing cash balances and the expanded borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable longterm operating needs 

the following table summarizes the company’s changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending december 31 2010 

 

2010 versus 2009 

operating 

our 2010 operating cash flow increased by 436 million or 27 primarily due to the 133 million increase in net income a 90 million decrease in cash payments for income taxes and a 121 million decrease in payments for severance interest payments on our debt and excess facilities we also received 24 million in cash in 2010 from an insurance recovery and approximately 198 million of improvements in our working capital accounts which includes increased cash collections on our receivables partially offsetting these increases were 80 million in acquisition and integration payments made in 2010 related to the acquisitions of amr research and burton group and 50 million more in 2010 bonus payments 

investing 

cash used in our investing activities declined by 858 million in 2010 due to the acquisitions of amr research and burton group in 2009 we paid 1045 million in cash for these acquisitions in december 2009 and an additional 122 million in january 2010 we used 217 million of cash in 2010 for capital expenditures compared to 151 million in the 2009 period an increase of 66 million or 43 

financing 

cash used in our financing activities was 978 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 with a total of 1716 million used in 2010 compared to 738 million used in 2009 the additional cash used was due to higher debt repayments and additional share repurchases in 2010 

on a net basis we repaid 1088 million of debt in 2010 compared to 873 million in the prior year an increase in cash used of 216 million we used 998 million of cash for share repurchases in 2010 compared to 37 million in 2009 an increase in cash used of 961 million we also paid 48 million in cash in 2010 for fees related to our debt refinancing partially offsetting these higher uses of cash was an additional 247 million in cash realized from option exercises and excess tax benefits as a higher average stock price in 2010 resulted in a significantly increased number of option exercises 

2009 versus 2008 

operating 

our operating cash flow decreased by 12 in 2009 or 224 million we had a decline of approximately 230 million in cash from our core operations along with 145 million more in cash taxes paid and 80 million in higher severance payments due to the workforce reduction completed in early january 2009 partially offsetting the declines were 148 million in lower interest payments on our debt bonus payments and payments on our excess facilities and an 83 million improvement in working capital the improved working capital primarily reflects improved cash collection on receivables 

investing 

we used an additional 1032 million of cash in our investing activities in 2009 due to the 1045 million of cash used for the acquisitions of amr research and burton group we had 151 million of capital expenditures in 2009 a decline of 38 compared to the 243 million of capital expenditures in 2008 the decline reflects the company’s tight focus on reducing costs we also realized 78 million of cash proceeds in 2008 from the sale of our vision events business 

financing 

cash used in financing activities declined by 461 million primarily due to a significant decline in the use of cash for stock repurchases cash used for stock repurchases declined by about 1971 million offsetting the decline in cash used for share repurchases was an increase in the use of cash to repay debt of about 1087 million and a decline in cash proceeds from option exercises and excess tax benefits from equity compensation of approximately 423 million 

obligations and commitments 

at december 31 2010 we had 2200 million outstanding under our 2010 credit agreement which provides for a fiveyear 2000 million term loan and a 4000 million revolving credit facility the 2010 credit agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased at the company’s option and under certain conditions by up to an additional 1500 million in the aggregate 

the term loan will be repaid in 19 consecutive quarterly installments commencing march 31 2011 plus a final payment due on december 22 2015 and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the company’s option the revolving credit facility may be used for loans and up to 400 million may be used for letters of credit the revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until december 22 2015 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid see note 6 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2010 credit agreement

 quarterly financial data 

the following tables present our quarterly operating results for the two year period ended december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 new accounting standards 

accounting guidance issued by the various standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective with respect to our consolidated financial statements are described below together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu 201006 “fair value measurements and disclosures” asu 201006 requires fair value hierarchy disclosures to be further disaggregated by class of assets and liabilities a class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the balance sheet in addition significant transfers between levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy are required to be disclosed these additional disclosure requirements became effective january 1 2010 in general we do not anticipate transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy and for the year ended december 31 2010 there were none our required fair value disclosures are presented in note 12 — fair value disclosures  herein in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning january 1 2011 the fasb will also require additional disclosures regarding changes in level 3 instruments the company currently does not have any level 3 instruments 

in september 2009 the fasb issued asu 200913 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” asu 200913 requires companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on the estimated selling price of each deliverable even though such deliverables are not sold separately either by the company itself or other vendors asu 200913 eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered as a result the new guidance is expected to allow some companies to recognize revenue on transactions that involve multiple deliverables earlier than under current requirements asu 200913 will be effective for gartner beginning january 1 2011 the company’s multiple revenue arrangements are limited and as a result we do not expect any impact on our consolidated statement of operations related to the adoption of this guidance 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to changes in interest rates arising from borrowings under our 2010 credit agreement and at december 31 2010 we had 2000 million outstanding under the term loan and 200 million outstanding under the revolver borrowings under this facility are floating rate which may be either primebased or eurodollarbased interest rates under these borrowings include a base rate plus a margin between 050 and 125 on prime borrowings and between 150 and 225 on eurodollarbased borrowings 

as of december 31 2010 the annualized interest rate on the term loan was 230 which consisted of a 03 threemonth eurodollar base rate plus a margin of 20 and 226 on the revolver which consisted of a 026 onemonth eurodollar base rate plus a margin of 20 we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first 2000 million of our borrowings to a 226 fixed rate 

the company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first 2000 million of its outstanding borrowings accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings in excess of 2000 million a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would change pretax annual interest expense on the additional 4000 million borrowing capacity under the 2010 credit agreement by approximately 10 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have customers in 85 countries and 44 and 45 of our revenues for 2010 and 2009 respectively were derived from sales outside of the us as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk 

translation risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact our operating results 

a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our condensed consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2010 we had over 1200 million of cash and cash equivalents a substantial portion of which was denominated in foreign currencies if the foreign exchange rates of the major currencies in which we operate changed in comparison to the us dollar by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2010 would have increased or decreased by approximately 50 million 

because our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally 

transaction risk 

we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since we typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates 

we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration and unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings at december 31 2010 we had 63 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of 2502 million and a net unrealized gain of 06 million all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2011 

concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the company’s cash and cash equivalents and its interest rate swap contract are with investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the company’s 2010 credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

competition 

we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are 

 

  

 

 

  

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future additionally we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

factors that may affect future performance 

we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following section discusses many but not all of these risks and uncertainties but is not intended to be allinclusive 

 

 

risks related to our business 

 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by general economic conditions our business is impacted by general economic conditions both domestic and abroad the global credit crisis and economic downturn that began in 2008 and continued throughout 2009 could negatively and materially affect demand for our products and services this downturn could materially and adversely affect our business including the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth and attract attendees and exhibitors to our events such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

 

while we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

 

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

 

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 66 and 60 of our revenues for 2009 and 2008 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

 

our research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

  

 

 

 

additionally as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while research client retention rate was 78 at december 31 2009 and 82 at december 31 2008 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 25 of our total revenues for 2009 and 27 for 2008 these consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

  

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control the global credit crisis and economic downturn that began in 2008 and continued throughout 2009 severely impacted travel budgets of all organizations which may continue to negatively impact our business the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event 

 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated we derive revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and their respective agencies as well as foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2009 and 2008 approximately 1820 million and 1920 million respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments we believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at december 31 2009 will be filled in 2010 our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government authorizations and funding mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause “termination for convenience” should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of revenue 

 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth we have clients in over 80 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign 

 

 

operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

 

our international operations expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates approximately 45 and 47 of our revenues for 2009 and 2008 respectively were derived from sales outside of the us revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida in a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our operating results abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients 

 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers harming our operating results and financial condition 

 

our outstanding debt obligations could impact our financial condition or future operating results at december 31 2009 we had 3290 million outstanding under our credit agreement which provides for two amortizing term loans with quarterly payments and a 3000 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional 1000 million at our lenders’ discretion the “expansion feature” for a total revolving credit facility of 4000 million however the 1000 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions 

 

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit agreement 

 

the associated debt service costs of the borrowing arrangement under our credit agreement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the remaining borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable longterm operating needs 

 

we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and 

 

 

use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business 

 

we face risks related to litigation we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 

 

we face risks related to taxation we operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction may have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we recognize in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business and in the ordinary course of business we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities from time to time 

 

these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes and resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts we have recorded additionally the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

 

risks related to our common stock 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline 

 

our stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid the trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors variations in operating results developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period such volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards as of december 31 2009 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under these plans was approximately 115 million shares approximately 58 million of which have vested in addition approximately 74 million shares may be issued in connection with future

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours as of december 31 2009 valueact capital and affiliates “valueact” owned approximately 217 of our common stock to our knowledge as of the date of this report four other institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock additionally a representative of valueact presently holds one seat on our board of directors 

 

while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in the company accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of the company or all stockholders 

 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include 

 

  

these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

the following items impact the presentation and discussion of results in this mda section 

 

on december 18 2009 we acquired amr research and on december 30 2009 we acquired burton group the financial results of these businesses which were not material to our 2009 results have been included in our results beginning on their respective dates of acquisition see note 2 — acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the operating metrics of these acquired businesses have been excluded from our business measurements presentations and discussions below for comparability purposes

we have three business segments research consulting and events 

 

  

 

 

  

business measurements 

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 

 

 

 

executive summary of operations and financial position 

we purchased amr research and burton group in december 2009 we believe each of these companies is recognized as bestinclass for what they do and will expand our research market opportunity and accelerate our growth rate over time 

 

we had total revenues of 11398 million in 2009 a decline of 11 from the prior year revenues decreased in all 3 of our business segments and all of our geographic regions excluding the impact of foreign currency translation total revenues were down about 8 in 2009 we attribute the decline in revenue to the global economic downturn that began in 2008 

 

we had income from continuing operations of 830 million in 2009 or 085 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of 971 million or 098 per diluted share for 2008 the decline primarily reflects lower profitability in our consulting and events segments 

 

research revenues were down 4 yearoveryear to 7525 million in 2009 from 7816 million in the prior year excluding the impact of foreign currency research revenues were down 1 yearoveryear despite the yearoveryear decline in research revenues gross contribution margin increased by 2 points primarily due to the tight cost controls we have implemented and to a lesser extent our ability to implement price increases for our products 

 

as of december 31 2009 research contract value was 7844 million client retention was 78 and wallet retention was 87 research contract value at december 31 2009 was down 6 compared to the prior year end but adjusted for the impact of foreign currency was down 1 yearoveryear while down yearoveryear the 7844 million of contract value at december 31 2009 increased 6 from september 30 2009 reflecting a broadbased increase with all industries geographies and client sizes showing improvement during the quarter 

 

consulting revenues declined 17 yearoveryear to 2868 million in 2009 from 3474 million in 2008 primarily due to a decline in core consulting excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues declined 15 the consulting segment contribution margin declined 2 points primarily due to lower revenue in our contract optimization business and fewer sas days filled which have a higher contribution margin than core consulting utilization in core consulting was 68 for 2009 backlog was 909 million at december 31 2009 a decline of 6 from december 31 2008 

 

events revenues decreased 33 in 2009 compared to the prior year due to discontinued events and a decline in revenue from our ongoing events we discontinued a number of events in 2009 in response to the economic downturn travel restrictions and other 

 

 

factors we held 54 events in 2009 compared to 70 in 2008 with a 12 decline in attendees at our 51 ongoing events the segment contribution margin declined by 2 points yearoveryear to 41 

 

for a more detailed discussion of our segment results see segment results below 

 

during 2009 we continued our focus on enhancing shareholder value by reducing our outstanding debt we repaid 953 million of our term loans during 2009 which represented approximately 32 of the amount outstanding we also used 1045 million in cash to acquire amr research and burton group 

 

we had 1619 million of operating cash flow for the year ended december 31 2009 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 1166 million as of december 31 2009 and we had approximately 1700 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we believe that our cash position and borrowing capacity is more than adequate to meet our existing cash and liquidity requirements 

 

fluctuations in quarterly results 

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series that normally are held during the fourth calendar quarter and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in the industry and other factors the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below 

 

the preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience as well as other factors including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate however our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision in addition these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company’s financial statements in future periods 

 

our critical accounting policies are as follows 

 

revenue recognition  – we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

 

  

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses which have not produced material cancellations to date it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

 

for those government contracts that permit cancellation we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract in addition we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were 653 million and 616 million at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively in addition at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 we had 

 

 

not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit termination of 83 million and 121 million respectively 

 

uncollectible fees receivable  – the allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 

 

the following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses in thousands 

 

 

 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  – the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis 

 

our annual goodwill assessment requires us to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge for a portion of the associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in our financial statements 

 

factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following 

 

  

due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty and as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

 

we completed the annual goodwill impairment testing in the quarter ended september 30 2009 and concluded that the fair values of each of the company’s reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 

 

accounting for income taxes  – as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation  – the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 107 “sab no 107” and no 110 “sab no 110” the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 

 

 

over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 10 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

 

restructuring and other accruals  – we may record accruals for severance costs costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased contract terminations asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 

 

we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end 

 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the changes in selected line items in our consolidated statements of operation for the periods indicated dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

  

2009 versus 2008 

total revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 decreased 1393 million or 11 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2008 revenues declined across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business 

 

 

segments the impact of foreign currency had a negative impact on our revenues in 2009 and excluding this impact total revenues in 2009 were down 8 compared to 2008 our revenues and operating results were negatively impacted by global economic conditions in 2009

please refer to the section of this mda below entitled “segment results” for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

 

cost of services and product development decreased 738 million yearoveryear or 13 the favorable impact of foreign currency translation reduced expense by about 190 million we had lower conference expenses of 185 million primarily due to discontinued events we also had reduced travel and internal meeting charges of 167 million and lower personnel costs of about 125 million primarily due to our tight cost controls the remaining 71 million net decrease was spread across a number of other expense categories cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales declined by 1 point to 44 in 2009 from 45 in 2008 primarily due to tight expense controls across our businesses 

 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense decreased by about 380 million in 2009 or 7 compared to 2008 despite increasing our sales force the impact of foreign currency translation reduced expense by about 180 million we also had lower travel internal meeting and recruiting costs of about 190 million again due to our tight cost controls the remaining net reduction was spread across a number of other expense categories excluding the 60 sales associates that joined us from amr research and burton group we had 942 quotabearing sales associates at december 31 2009 a 2 increase from the prior year end this additional investment in sales associates resulted in 90 million of higher payroll and benefits costs which was offset by lower ga charges 

 

depreciation expense decreased 2 yearoveryear which reflects reduced capital spending during 2009 capital spending decreased to 151 million in 2009 from 243 million in 2008 a 38 decline which reflects the company’s reduced 2009 capital expenditures 

 

amortization of intangibles was 16 million for both 2009 and 2008 

 

acquisition and integration charges was 29 million in 2009 and zero in 2008 included is these charges are legal fees and consultant fees in connection with the acquisitions and integration of amr research and burton group as well as severance costs related to redundant headcount 

 

operating income decreased 18 yearoveryear to 1345 million in 2009 from 1644 million in 2008 operating income as a percentage of revenues declined 1 point yearoveryear primarily due to lower profitability in our consulting and events segments and the 29 million acquisition and integration charge related to amr research and burton group 

 

please refer to the section of this mda entitled “segment results” below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

 

interest expense net was 160 million in 2009 and 193 million in 2008 a 17 decline the 2009 period includes 11 million of expense related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting on an interest rate swap contract see note 7 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements excluding the 11 million charge interest expense net would have 

 

 

declined approximately 22 yearoveryear the yearoveryear decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in the weightedaverage amount of debt outstanding 

 

other expense income net of 29 million in 2009 consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses the 04 million other expense in 2008 primarily consisted of a 12 million gain related to the settlement of a litigation matter offset by net foreign currency exchange losses 

 

provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 326 million in 2009 as compared to 476 million in 2008 the effective tax rate was 282 in 2009 and 329 in 2008 the lower effective tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 is attributable to several items the most significant of these items include the following a the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions relating to the expiration of statutes of limitation was larger in 2009 than in 2008 while pretax income was lower and b differences relating to the taxability of life insurance contracts yearoveryear 

 

income from discontinued operations net of taxes includes the results of the company’s vision events business which we sold in early 2008 the 67 million of income for 2008 includes a net gain on sale of approximately 71 million and a 04 million operating loss 

 

net income was 830 million in 2009 and 1039 million in 2008 a decline of 209 million or 20 the decline was primarily driven by the reduced contributions by our three business segments in the 2009 period and to a lesser extent the 29 million acquisition and integration charge we recorded related to amr research and burton group these decreases were partially offset by lower sga charges a lower effective income tax rate and reduced interest expense also contributing to the yearoveryear decline in net income was the 67 million net gain from the sale of the company’s former vision events business recorded in the 2008 period 

 

basic earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 14 yearoveryear diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 13 yearoveryear 

 

2008 versus 2007 

total revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 increased 1106 million or 9 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2007 revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in our research and consulting segments excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation total revenues for 2008 would have increased 8 over 2007 

 

an overview of our results by geographic region follows 

 

  

an overview of our results by segment follows 

 

  

please refer to the section of this mda below entitled “segment results” for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

 

cost of services and product development increased 256 million yearoveryear or 5 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange cost of service and product development would have increased by about 4 

 

the yearoveryear increase was due to several factors we had 170 million of higher salary commissions and other benefit costs 57 million in additional severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force and 40 million in additional events fulfillment costs the impact of foreign currency translation added about 21 million of expense partially offsetting these higher charges was a decrease of approximately 32 million in lower headcount costs primarily due to our exit from consulting operations in asiapacific in mid2007 

 

 

as a percentage of sales cost of services and product development was 45 and 47 in 2008 and 2007 respectively a decrease of 2 points which is due to a number of factors these factors include higher revenues coupled with the inherent operating leverage in our research business improved productivity in core consulting substantially increased revenues in our higher margin contract optimization business in our consulting segment and a continued focus on expense management 

 

sga expense increased by 580 million in 2008 or 13 compared to 2007 the increase in 2008 expense was primarily due to higher investment in our sales organization severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force and increases in other payroll and benefits costs growth in our sales organization resulted in approximately 380 million of additional payroll and benefits commissions and travel expense in 2008 when compared to 2007 we had 928 quotabearing sales associates as of december 31 2008 a 15 increase over december 31 2007 we had 28 million in severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter 2008 reduction in force while higher payroll and related benefits costs for our other staff added about 130 million in costs the remaining increase was spread across a number of other cost categories which was offset to some extent by lower recruiting and stockbased compensation charges 

 

depreciation expense increased 7 in 2008 to 259 million compared to 243 million for the prior year the increase was primarily due to a change in the mix of investment in capital expenditures 

 

amortization of intangibles was 16 million in 2008 compared to 21 million in 2007 the decrease was due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2007 

 

other charges was zero in 2008 and 91 million in 2007 the 91 million included charges of 87 million related to the settlement of litigation and 27 million of severance costs related to the company’s exit from consulting operations in asia offsetting these charges was a credit of 23 million related to an excess facility which the company returned to service 

 

operating income was 1644 million and 1295 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively an increase of 349 million or 27 operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13 in 2008 and 11 in 2007 a 2 point increase which is due to a number of factors the most significant being the impact from higher revenues in our research and consulting businesses the improved operating margin also reflects our tight focus on expense management and charges of 91 million in 2007 related to the settlement of litigation and other items 

 

please refer to the section of this mda entitled “segment results” below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment 

 

interest expense net was 193 million and 222 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively a decrease of 29 million the decrease was primarily due to a decline in the weightedaverage interest rate on our outstanding debt the weightedaverage interest rate on our debt including the impact of our interest rate swaps was 48 in 2008 and 60 in 2007 the impact of the lower average rate was partially offset by an increase in the weightedaverage amount of debt outstanding of approximately 500 million during 2008 in 2008 we also had about 02 million of additional interest income as well as a 02 million decrease in the amortization of debt issuance costs both of which are recorded in interest expense net 

 

other expense income net was 04 million in 2008 and 32 million in 2007 the 04 million other expense in 2008 primarily consisted of a 12 million gain related to the settlement of a litigation matter offset by net foreign currency exchange losses the 32 million of other income in 2007 primarily consisted of a 18 million gain from the settlement of a claim and net foreign currency exchange gains 

 

provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 476 million in 2008 as compared to 398 million 2007 the effective tax rate was 329 in 2008 and 360 in 2007 the lower effective tax rate in 2008 as compared to 2007 was attributable to several items the most significant of these items included the following a the company generated a larger percentage of its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2008 as compared to 2007 and b differences relating to the tax impact of repatriated funds in 2008 as compared to 2007 

 

income from discontinued operations net of taxes which includes the results of the company’s vision events business was 67 million and 29 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively the company sold the vision events business which had been part of the company’s events segment in early 2008 the results for 2008 included a net gain on the sale of approximately 71 million and a loss from operations of 04 million 

 

net income was 1039 million and 736 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively an increase of 303 million or 41 

 

basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased 034 per share yearoveryear diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 033 per share yearoveryear 

 

 

segment results 

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain cost of services and product development charges and sga depreciation acquisition and integration charges amortization of intangibles and other charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues 

 

we acquired amr research on december 18 2009 and burton group on december 30 2009 the financial results of these businesses are included in the financial measurements beginning on their respective dates of acquisition the results of these businesses were not material to our segment results business measurements exclude data applicable to these businesses 

 

the following sections present the results of our three segments 

 

research 

 

 

 

  

2009 versus 2008 

research revenues declined 4 yearoveryear but excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation research revenues were down about 1 

 

in spite of lower revenues the research contribution margin increased 2 points yearoveryear the improved margin was primarily driven by the tight cost controls we have implemented which resulted in lower costs concentrated in personnel travel and internal meetings and our ability to implement price increases for our products 

 

contract value decreased 6 when comparing december 31 2009 to december 31 2008 but excluding the impact of foreign currency translation contract value was down 1 yearoveryear 

 

while down yearoveryear contract value increased 420 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 or 6 one of our highest ever quarterly increases with growth across all industries geographies and client sizes we believe the increase reflects both improved sales effectiveness as well as an improving economic environment 

 

2008 versus 2007 

revenue in our research business was up 14 in 2008 to 7816 million we had growth across our entire product portfolio in 2008 foreign currency translation impact was not significant 

 

research gross contribution increased to 4954 million in 2008 from 4196 million in 2007 an 18 increase while the contribution margin increased 2 points to 63 from 61 the yearoveryear contribution margin improved primarily due to our stronger revenue performance coupled with the operating leverage inherent in our research business along with tight expense management 

 

contract value was 8343 million as of december 31 2008 up 11 from 7525 million at december 31 2007 adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation contract value was up approximately 8 

 

 

consulting 

 

 

 

  

2009 versus 2008 

consulting revenues declined 17 when comparing 2009 with 2008 with the majority of the decline in core consulting and to a lesser extent in our sas and contract optimization businesses the decline in core consulting was driven by lower headcount utilization and billing rates the decline in revenue in our contract optimization business reflects a large contract received at the end of 2008 which was not repeated in 2009 sas revenues declined due to approximately 17 fewer fulfilled sas days excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency overall consulting revenues were down about 15 

 

the 2 point decline in the consulting contribution margin reflects lower revenue in our sas and contract optimization businesses which have higher margins than core consulting to a lesser extent the decline also reflects lower utilization and billing rates in core consulting 

 

we ended 2009 with 442 billable consultants a decline of 11 from the prior year end as we tightly managed resources to match demand the decline reflects normal attrition as well as the termination of approximately 30 consultants in january 2009 to better align our delivery resources with lower backlog 

 

consulting backlog declined 6 yearoveryear but increased 7 sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 909 million as demand for our consulting services was solid in the us while demand in europe lagged 

 

2008 versus 2007 

consulting revenues increased yearoveryear by 224 million or 7 excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues for 2008 were up about 6 the revenue increase was due to strength in both the core consulting and benchmarking businesses and exceptionally strong results in our contract optimization business contributing to the yearoveryear revenue increase in our contract optimization business was the completion of one large contract in the fourth quarter of 2008 which resulted in approximately 110 million of revenue 

 

consulting gross contribution increased by 131 million while the gross contribution margin improved by 2 points these improvements were driven by improved utilization on higher headcount and higher billing rates and higher revenues in our contract optimization business which has a higher margin than our core consulting business 

 

consulting backlog which represents future revenues to be recognized from inprocess consulting measurement and sas was 972 million at december 31 2008 compared to 1214 million at december 31 2007 as bookings slowed in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the weaker economic environment 

 

 

events 

 

 

 

  

2009 versus 2008 

events revenue was down 496 million or 33 in 2009 due to the impact of discontinued events and a decline in revenue from our ongoing events we held 54 events in 2009 a decline of 16 events compared to the prior year the 54 events held in 2009 consisted of 51 ongoing events and 3 new events the number of attendees at our 51 ongoing events was down 12 while the number of exhibitors was down 31 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency events revenues were down 32 yearoveryear 

 

approximately 240 million of the revenue decrease was due to 19 discontinued events including our spring symposium which was a significant event in prior years we discontinued these events in 2009 in response to the difficult operating environment with tight travel restrictions and budget cuts at many companies due to the weak economy we also had a 300 million decline in revenue from our 51 ongoing events these declines were slightly offset by approximately 40 million in higher revenue from new event launches and other miscellaneous events revenues the events contribution margin was down 2 points yearoveryear primarily due to lower average attendee and exhibitor revenue at our 51 ongoing events 

 

while the number of attendees was down significantly yearoveryear this trend began to show improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 with attendance at our ongoing events up 2 we also began to see improvement in exhibitor participation we believe these trends reflect a loosening of corporate travel budgets resumed growth in marketing spend by technology companies and our continuing efforts to increase client retention by enhancing the value and experience that our clients derive from our events 

 

2008 versus 2007 

events revenues decreased 6 yearoveryear or 100 million reflecting lower revenues from both attendees and exhibitors excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation events revenues were down approximately 7 yearoveryear we held 70 events in 2008 compared to 62 events in 2007 with overall attendance down about 6 to 41352 in 2008 from 44216 in 2007 

 

the 70 events held in 2008 included 59 ongoing events and 11 new events during 2008 the number of exhibitors at our ongoing events declined by approximately 13 while attendance was 38961 as compared to 42554 attendees in 2007 an 8 decrease average revenue at these ongoing events declined slightly for attendees but increased slightly for exhibitors revenues from the 11 new events we held in 2008 was only slightly higher than the events we discontinued the majority of the yearoveryear revenue shortfall occurred in our fourth quarter as travel restrictions cuts in marketing budgets and other expense controls at many companies took effect in response to the credit crisis and weakening global economy 

 

events gross contribution was 650 million in 2008 compared to 819 million for 2007 while the yearoveryear gross contribution margin declined by 8 points to 43 from 51 the decrease in the gross contribution margin was primarily due to lower revenues higher fulfillment costs the impact of lower margin new events and severance charges related to our reduction in force 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our ongoing operating activities as of december 31 2009 we had 1165 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1700 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility not including the 1000 million expansion feature our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately 60 held outside the united states as of december 31 2009 

 

 

we repaid 953 million of our term loans in 2009 thus reducing the amount of term loans outstanding by about 32 we paid 1045 million in cash in december 2009 and 131 million in january 2010 for the acquisitions of amr research and burton group 

 

we believe that we have adequate liquidity and that the cash we expect to earn from our ongoing operating activities our existing cash balances and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable longterm operating needs 

 

the following table summarizes the company’s changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending december 31 2009 

 

 

 

2009 versus 2008 

operating 

our operating cash flow decreased by 12 in 2009 or 224 million we had a decline of approximately 230 million in cash from our core operations along with 145 million more in cash taxes paid and 80 million in higher severance payments due to the workforce reduction completed in early january 2009 partially offsetting the declines were 148 million in lower interest payments on our debt bonus payments and payments on our excess facilities and an 83 million improvement in working capital the improved working capital primarily reflects improved cash collection on receivables 

 

investing 

we used an additional 1032 million of cash in our investing activities in 2009 due to the 1045 million of cash used for the acquisitions of amr research and burton group we had 151 million of capital expenditures in 2009 a decline of 38 compared to the 243 million of capital expenditures in 2008 the decline reflects the company’s tight focus on reducing costs we also realized 78 million of cash proceeds in 2008 from the sale of our vision events business 

 

financing 

cash used in financing activities declined by 461 million primarily due to a significant decline in the use of cash for stock repurchases cash used for stock repurchases declined by about 1971 million offsetting the decline in cash used for share repurchases was an increase in the use of cash to repay debt of about 1087 million and a decline in cash proceeds from option exercises and excess tax benefits from equity compensation of approximately 423 million 

 

2008 versus 2007 

operating 

cash provided by operating activities increased 361 million or 24 in 2008 compared to 2007 the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to substantially increased cash from our core operations and improvement in our working capital which together added approximately 450 million in higher operating cash flow our working capital improved primarily due to improved collection of receivables also contributing to the improved cash flow was 120 million in lower cash payments related to severance excess facilities and settlement of litigation and about 20 million less in interest paid on our debt as interest rates declined the improved operating cash flow in 2008 was somewhat offset by higher cash payments for taxes and bonuses of approximately 230 million 

 

investing 

cash used in investing activities was 165 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to cash used of 241 million in 2007 we had capital expenditures of 243 million in the year ended december 31 2008 which was offset by net cash proceeds from the sale of our vision events business of approximately 78 million we had capital expenditures of 242 million in 2007 

 

 

financing 

cash used in financing activities totaled 1198 million in 2008 compared to cash used of 937 million in 2007 an increase in cash used of 261 million the increased use of cash was primarily due to a significantly higher use of cash for stock repurchases in 2008 we used an additional 340 million of cash to repurchase our shares in 2008 to 2008 million in 2008 compared to 1668 million in 2007 partially offsetting the additional use of cash used for stock repurchases was an increase of 102 million in cash proceeds from stock issued for stock plans which rose to 447 million in 2008 compared to 345 million in 2007 driven by higher option exercises 

 

obligations and commitments 

at december 31 2009 we had 3290 million outstanding under our credit agreement which provides for two amortizing term loans and a 3000 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional 1000 million at our lenders’ discretion the “expansion feature” for a total revolving credit facility of 4000 million however the 1000 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions 

 

the term loans are being repaid in consecutive quarterly installments plus a final payment due on january 31 2012 and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at our option the revolving loan facility may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until january 31 2012 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid see note 7 — debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the credit agreement

new accounting standards 

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu 20106 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fairvalue measurements including significant transfers into and out of level 1 and level 2 fairvalue measurements and information on purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level 3 fairvalue measurements asu 20106 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for level 3 reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2010 we do not expect the adoption of asu 20106 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to changes in interest rates resulting from the 2010 million outstanding on our two term loans and 1280 million outstanding on our revolver as of december 31 2009 all of these borrowings are floating rate which may be either primebased or liborbased interest rates under these borrowings include a base rate plus a margin currently between 000 and 075 on prime borrowings and between 625 and 175 on liborbased borrowings 

 

as of december 31 2009 the annualized interest rates on the original term loan the 2008 term loan and the revolver were 10 126 and 10 respectively the rates on the original and 2008 term loans consisted of a threemonth libor base rate plus margins of 075 and 100 respectively the rate on the revolver consisted of a onemonth libor base rate plus a margin of 075 

 

we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the original term loan to a fixed rate as a result our exposure to interest rate risk on the original term loan is capped including the effect of the interest rate swap the annualized interest rate on the original term loan was 581 as of december 31 2009 

 

the company does not hedge the interest rate risk on the 2008 term loan and the revolver accordingly we are exposed to interest rate risk on this debt a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would change pretax annual interest expense on the 3000 million revolver and the 800 million outstanding on the 2008 term loan by approximately 10 million 

 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have clients in over 80 countries and as a result we conduct business in numerous currencies other than the us dollar among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar our foreign currency exposure results in both translation risk and transaction risk 

 

translation risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency translation risk arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and these exchange rates fluctuate over time these foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact our operating results 

 

a measure of the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our consolidated balance sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2009 we had 1166 million of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 700 million was denominated in foreign currencies if foreign exchange rates in comparison to the us dollar changed by 10 the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on december 31 2009 would have increased or decreased by approximately 40 million 

 

our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional currency that differs from the us dollar revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations historically this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally 

 

transaction risk 

we also have foreign exchange transaction risk since we typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from local functional currencies in which the foreign subsidiaries operate 

 

we typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of this foreign currency transaction risk these contracts are normally short term in duration unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings at december 31 2009 we had 19 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a total notional amount of 1173 million and a net unrealized gain of approximately 07 million all of these contracts matured by the end of january 2010 

 

concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the company’s cash equivalent investments and its two interest rate swap contracts are with investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the company’s credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future additionally we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future performance 

we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions the following section discusses many but not all of these risks and uncertainties but is not intended to be allinclusive 

risks related to our business 

our operating results could be negatively impacted by the current global credit crisis and the economic downturn 

our business is impacted by general economic conditions both domestic and abroad the current global credit crisis and economic downturn may negatively and materially affect demand for our products and services this downturn could materially and adversely affect our business including the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth and attract attendees and exhibitors to our events such developments could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information available on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 

while we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services 

we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive 

the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the it industry as a whole the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process nonetheless to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services deliver all products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position additionally significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues 

a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 60 and 58 of our revenues for 2008 and 2007 respectively generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

our research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

additionally as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while research client retention rates were 82 at both december 31 2008 and 2007 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues 

consulting segment revenues constituted 27 of our total revenues for 2008 and 28 for 2007 these consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control 

the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions economic slowdowns terrorist attacks weather natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated 

we derive revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and their respective agencies as well as foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2008 and 2007 1920 million and 1900 million respectively of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government authorizations and funding mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts 

may be terminated at any time without cause ‘termination for convenience” should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of revenue 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services 

our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name 

we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth 

we have clients in over 80 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and laws and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

our international operations expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

approximately 47 and 45 of our revenues for 2008 and 2007 respectively were derived from sales outside of the us revenues earned outside the us are typically transacted in local currencies which may fluctuate significantly against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business 

a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from new york city and we have an operations center located in ft myers florida in a hurricaneprone area we also operate in numerous international locations a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our operating results abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs additionally these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure 

our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites however any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers harming our operating results and financial condition 

our outstanding debt obligations could impact our financial condition or future operating results 

at december 31 2008 we had 4163 million outstanding under our credit agreement which provides for two amortizing term loans with quarterly payments and a 3000 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional 1000 million at our lenders’ discretion the “expansion feature” for a total revolving credit facility of 4000 million however the 1000 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions 

the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the credit agreement could limit our future financial flexibility additionally a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current financial climate or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the credit agreement 

the associated debt service costs of the borrowing arrangement under our credit agreement could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

we believe that our existing cash balances projected cash flow from operations and the remaining borrowing capacity we have under our fiveyear revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable longterm operating needs 

we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business 

we face risks related to litigation 

we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation 

we operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction may have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we recognize in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business and in the ordinary course of business we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities from time to time recently we have been notified by the internal revenue service that it intends to audit our 2007 tax return and this audit is expected to commence shortly 

these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes and resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts we have recorded additionally the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

risks related to our common stock 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business currency fluctuations changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline 

our stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid 

the trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors variations in operating results developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period such volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards as of december 31 2008 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under these plans was approximately 111 million shares approximately 67 million of which have vested in addition approximately 58 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable without further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act we cannot predict the size of future issuances of 

our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours 

valueact capital and affiliates “valueact” owned approximately 221 of our common stock as of december 31 2008 while silver lake partners and affiliates “silver lake” owned approximately 128 on the same date to our knowledge three other institutional investors each presently hold over 5 of our common stock additionally representatives of silver lake and valueact in the aggregate presently hold three seats on our board of directors 

while no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares these significant stockholders may be able either individually or acting together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers acquisitions consolidations and sales or purchases of assets in addition in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third party this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in the company accordingly the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders or otherwise be in the best interests of the company or all stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include 

 

these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

we have three business segments research consulting and events 

 

 

 

 

business measurements 

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 

 

executive summary of operations and financial position 

the cornerstones of our strategy are to focus on producing extraordinary research content deliver innovative and highly differentiated product offerings enhance our sales capability provide world class client service and improve our operational effectiveness 

we had total revenues of 12791 million in 2008 up 9 over the prior year total revenues increased in all of our geographic regions we had income from continuing operations of 971 million in 2008 or 098 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of 707 million or 065 per diluted share for 2007 these improved results are due to a number of factors including higher overall revenues in research and consulting a continued focus on expense management the impact of a legal settlement and other charges in 2007 the favorable impact of foreign currency and a lower share base due to share repurchases these positive trends offset lower revenue and profitability in our events segment 

in our research business we had strong doubledigit revenue growth in 2008 with revenues up 15 over the prior year to 7732 million revenue growth occurred across our entire product portfolio with all client sizes industry segments and products delivering growth research contract value was 8343 million at december 31 2008 up 11 from december 31 2007 and a record level for us our contract value growth was broadbased across all of our industry sectors excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues and contract value were up 14 and 8 yearoveryear respectively 

our client retention and wallet retention rates for 2008 remained strong at 82 and 98 respectively compared to 82 and 101 in the prior year our executive program membership was 3733 at december 31 2008 compared to 3753 members at december 31 2007 

consulting revenue in 2008 was up 7 over 2007 to 3474 million reflecting growth in our core consulting and benchmarking businesses and exceptionally strong results in our contract optimization business our consultant utilization rate increased 3 points to 72 from 69 in the prior year reflecting improved engagement management billable headcount was 499 at december 31 2008 up from 472 at december 31 2007 the hourly billing rate remained above 350 per hour in 2008 while the average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately 458000 for 2008 about 7 higher than the prior year consulting backlog at december 31 2008 was 972 million down from 1214 million at december 31 2007 

events revenues decreased 6 or 100 million to 1501 million in 2008 compared to 1601 million in 2007 we held 70 events in 2008 compared to 62 in 2007 the revenue decrease was due to declines in both the number of attendees and exhibitors as travel restrictions and other expense controls negatively impacted our fourth quarter events segment results for 2009 we are currently planning to hold 54 events 

for a more detailed discussion of our segment results see segment results below 

we repurchased 97 million of our common shares in 2008 we had 1844 million of operating cash flow in 2008 significantly higher than the prior year and we ended the year with 1409 million in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2008 we also had 1783 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we believe we have a strong cash position and adequate borrowing capacity 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in the industry and other factors the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and the use of estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

revenue recognition — we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

 

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses which have not produced material cancellations to date it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that 

is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 

for those government contracts that permit termination we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract in addition we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were 616 million and 576 million at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively in addition at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit termination of 121 million and 108 million respectively 

uncollectible fees receivable — the allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and allowance reserve provisions are charged against earnings either as a reduction to revenues or an increase to expense the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable along with the related allowance for losses in thousands 

 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets — the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 — “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” among other requirements this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis these assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in our financial statements goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following 

 

due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty and as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

accounting for income taxes — as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment is 

made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made 

on january 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” see note 11 — income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements fin 48 is an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes in addition fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties and accounting in interim periods and requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 

accounting for stockbased compensation — on january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab no 107” effective with the adoption of sfas no 123r the company is recognizing stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 9 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals — we record accruals for severance costs lease costs associated with excess facilities contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates reserve levels may need to be adjusted in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved additionally we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end

cost of services and product development increased 240 million or about 5 when comparing 2008 with 2007 to 5548 million from 5308 million excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange cost of service and product development would have increased by about 4 

the yearoveryear increase of 240 million was due to several factors we had 170 million of higher salary commissions and other benefit costs 57 million in additional severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force and 40 million in additional events fulfillment costs the impact of foreign currency translation added about 21 million of expense partially offsetting these higher charges was a decrease of approximately 30 million in lower headcount costs primarily due to our exit from consulting operations in asiapacific in mid2007 as well as lower stockcompensation charges of about 12 million 

as a percentage of sales cost of services and product development was 43 and 45 in 2008 and 2007 respectively a decrease of 2 points which is due to a number of factors these factors include higher revenues coupled with the inherent operating leverage in our research business improved productivity in core consulting substantially increased revenues in our higher margin contract optimization business in our consulting segment and a continued focus on expense management 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased 13 or 596 million to 5324 million in 2008 compared to 4727 million in 2007 the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency translation was flat 

the 596 million increase in sga expense resulted primarily from increased investment in our sales organization severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force and increases in other payroll and benefits costs growth in our sales organization resulted in approximately 380 million of additional payroll and benefits commissions and travel expense in 2008 when compared to 2007 we now have 928 quotabearing sales associates a 15 increase over december 31 2007 we had 28 million in severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force while higher payroll and related benefits costs for our other staff added about 130 million in costs the remaining increase was spread across a number of other cost categories which was offset to some extent by lower recruiting and stockcompensation charges

amortization of intangibles was 16 million in 2008 compared to 21 million in 2007 the decrease was due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2007 

other charges was zero in 2008 and 91 million in 2007 the 91 million included charges of 87 million related to the settlement of litigation and 27 million of severance costs related to the company’s exit from consulting operations in asia offsetting these charges was a credit of 23 million related to an excess facility which the company returned to service

interest expense net was 193 million and 222 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively a decrease of 29 million the decrease was primarily due to a decline in the weightedaverage interest rate on our outstanding debt the weightedaverage interest rate on our debt including the impact of our interest rate swaps was 48 in 2008 and 60 in 2007 the impact of the lower average rate was 

partially offset by an increase in the weightedaverage amount of debt outstanding of approximately 500 million during 2008 in 2008 we also had about 02 million of additional interest income as well as a 02 million decrease in the amortization of debt issuance costs both of which are recorded in interest expense net

research gross contribution increased to 5077 million in 2008 from 4291 million in 2007 an 18 increase while the contribution margin increased 2 points to 66 from 64 the yearoveryear contribution margin improved primarily due to our stronger revenue performance coupled with the operating leverage inherent in our research business along with tight expense management 

contract value was 8343 million as of december 31 2008 up 11 from 7525 million at december 31 2007 adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation contract value was up approximately 8 at december 31 2008 our research client retention rate remained strong at 82 the same rate as of december 31 2007 wallet retention was 98 at december 31 2008 down from 101 at december 31 2007 our executive program membership was 3733 at december 31 2008 compared to 3753 members at december 31 2007 

consulting 

consulting revenues were 3474 million and 3250 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively an increase of 224 million or 7 excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues for 2008 were up about 6 the revenue increase was due to strength in both the core consulting and benchmarking businesses and exceptionally strong results in our contract optimization business contributing to the yearoveryear revenue increase in our contract optimization business was the completion of one large contract in the fourth quarter of 2008 which resulted in approximately 110 million of revenue 

consulting gross contribution of 1414 million for 2008 increased 10 from the 1282 million for 2007 while the contribution margin for 2008 increased 2 points to 41 from 39 in the prior year the increase in gross contribution and the gross contribution margin was driven by improved utilization on higher headcount and higher billing rates and higher revenues in our contract optimization business which has a higher margin than our core consulting business 

our consultant utilization rates were 72 and 69 for 2008 and 2007 respectively while the 366 hourly billing rate was up about 3 yearoveryear our billable headcount was 499 at december 31 2008 compared to 472 at december 31 2007 our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately 458000 for 2008 about 7 higher than the prior year these strong metrics reflect improved engagement management and the continuation of our focus on larger and more profitable engagements 

consulting backlog which represents future revenues to be recognized from inprocess consulting measurement and sas was 972 million at december 31 2008 compared to 1214 million at december 31 2007 as bookings slowed in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the weaker economic environment 

while we ended 2008 with 499 billable consultants the reduction in force action we took in january 2009 reduced this number by approximately 30 consultants this action was taken in order to better align our delivery resources with the lower backlog as we move into 2009 

events 

events revenues decreased 6 yearoveryear or 100 million to 1501 million in 2008 compared to 1601 million in 2007 reflecting lower revenues from both attendees and exhibitors excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation events revenues were down approximately 7 yearoveryear we held 70 events in 2008 compared to 62 events in 2007 with overall attendance down about 6 to 41352 in 2008 from 44216 in 2007

events gross contribution was 650 million in 2008 compared to 819 million for 2007 while the yearoveryear gross contribution margin declined by 8 points to 43 from 51 the decrease in gross contribution margin was primarily due to lower revenues higher fulfillment costs the impact of lower margin new events and severance charges related to our reduction in force 

as a result of the travel restrictions and other budget cuts at many companies and the weakening economy we have reduced the number of events planned in 2009 to 54 which reflects the discontinuance of 18 events including our two spring symposia as well as the launch of only two smaller new events the 18 discontinued events had approximately 210 million of revenue in 2008

cash used in investing activities was 241 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 218 million in 2006 the increase was due to a yearoveryear increase in capital expenditures which increased to 242 million in 2007 from 211 million in 2006

at december 31 2008 we had 4163 million outstanding under our credit agreement which provides for two amortizing term loans and a 3000 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional 1000 million at our lenders’ discretion the “expansion feature” for a total revolving credit facility of 4000 million however the 1000 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions 

the term loans are being repaid in consecutive quarterly installments plus a final payment due on january 31 2012 and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at our option the revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until january 31 2012 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid see note 6 — debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s credit agreement

 new accounting standards 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” which replaces fasb statement no 141 sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired in a business combination the statement requires that adjustments to tax benefits related to the acquiree that are recorded subsequent to the acquisition date will be recognized in income rather than as an adjustment of goodwill under the current rules the statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after december 15 2008 which for gartner is the fiscal year beginning january 1 2009 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 83 million of unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances related to our acquisition of meta while the possibility exists that some portion of these items may reverse in future periods we believe the impact to our provision and results of operations would not be significant accordingly we do not believe the adoption of the standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statement—amendments of arb no 51 “sfas no 160”” sfas no 160 requires the accounting and reporting of minority interests as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity the statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners sfas no 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements except notforprofit organizations but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary the statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after december 15 2008 which will be the company’s fiscal year beginning january 1 2009 the company does not believe the adoption of the standard will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to changes in interest rates resulting from 2963 million outstanding on our two term loans and 1200 million outstanding on our revolver all of which are floating rate borrowings our borrowings may be either primebased or liborbased interest rates under these borrowings include a base rate plus a margin between 000 and 075 on prime borrowings and between 625 and 175 on libor borrowings 

as of december 31 2008 the annualized interest rates on the original 2007 term loan the 2008 term loan and revolver were 246 296 and 147 respectively the rates on the original and new term loans consisted of a threemonth libor base rate plus margins of 100 and 150 on the original term loan and 2008 term loan respectively the rate on the revolver consisted of a onemonth libor base rate plus a margin of 100 

we have two interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base rates on the term loans to fixed rates including the effect of the interest rate swaps the annualized interest rates on the original term loan and 2008 term loan were 606 and 442 respectively as of december 31 2008 

the company does not hedge the interest rate risk on the revolver accordingly we are still exposed to interest rate risk on the revolver a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would change pretax annual interest expense on the 3000 million revolver by approximately 07 million when fully utilized 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 

amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact operating results revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk since we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these instruments are typically short term and are reflected at fair value with unrealized and realized gains and losses recorded in earnings at december 31 2008 we had 15 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a total notional amount of 734 million and a net unrealized loss of 25 million all of these contracts matured in january 2009 

concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of shortterm highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents accounts receivable and interest rate swap contracts the majority of the company’s cash equivalent investments and its two interest rate swap contracts are with investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the company’s credit agreement accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion

market overview 

information technology has become increasingly critical to the operational and financial success of corporations and governments over the last two decades once a support function it is now viewed as a strategic component of growth and operating performance accordingly it has become imperative for executives and it professionals to manage their it spending and purchasing decisions efficiently and effectively 

as the cost of it solutions continues to rise executives and technology professionals have realized the importance of making wellinformed decisions and increasingly seek to maximize their returns on it capital investments as a result any it investment decision in an enterprise is subject to increased financial scrutiny in addition today’s it marketplace is dynamic and complex technology providers continually introduce new products with a wide variety of standards and features that are prone to shorter life cycles users of technology — a group that encompasses nearly all organizations — must keep abreast of new developments in technology to ensure that their it systems are reliable efficient and meet their needs 

given the heightened emphasis organizations are placing on technology decision making and spending companies and governments are increasingly turning to outside experts for guidance in it procurement implementation and operations in order to maximize the value of their it investments accordingly it is critical that cios and other executives obtain valueadded independent and objective research and analysis of the it market to assist them in these itrelated decisions 

our solution

competition 

we believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding these differentiating factors we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future additionally we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future performance 

we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by the economy the following section discusses many but not all of these risks and uncertainties 

risks related to our business 

our operating results could be negatively impacted if the it industry experiences an economic down cycle 

our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in the it industry a general economic downturn or recession anywhere in the world could negatively affect demand for our products and services and may substantially reduce existing and potential client information technologyrelated budgets such a downturn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations including the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates and achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information that can be found on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services 

we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to introduce the new products and services that we need to remain competitive 

the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and approve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we depend on renewals of subscriptionbased services and sales of new subscriptionbased services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues 

a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 57 and 54 of our revenues for 2007 and 2006 respectively if we are not able to renew at historical rates and do not generate new sales in an amount sufficient to account for the shortfall arising from a decrease in renewals our revenues will be negatively affected 

our research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

 

additionally as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while research client retention rates were 82 and 81 at both december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

generating new sales of our subscriptionbased products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues 

consulting segment revenues constituted 27 and 29 of our revenues for 2007 and 2006 respectively these consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain desirable dates and locations 

the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns economic slowdowns terrorist attacks natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event 

our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated 

we derive revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and their respective agencies and foreign governments and their agencies at december 31 2007 approximately 1900 million of our research contract value and consulting backlog was attributable to governments our us government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the us congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government funding authorizations and mechanisms in general most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause ‘termination for convenience” should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed or should government contracts be terminated for convenience we may experience a significant loss of revenue 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services 

our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services as well as future business and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name 

we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively 

promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth 

our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

our international operations expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

approximately 45 of our revenues for 2007 and 2006 were derived from sales outside of the us revenues earned outside the us are transacted in local currencies which generally fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

the costs of servicing our outstanding debt obligations could impair our future operating results 

we have a 1800 million term loan as well as a 3000 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional 1000 million at our lenders’ discretion the “expansion feature” for a total revolving credit facility of 4000 million however the 1000 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions 

at december 31 2007 3940 million was outstanding on this facility the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the credit facility could limit our future financial flexibility the associated debt service costs of this facility could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

we may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

we believe that our existing cash balances cash flow from operations and the borrowing capacity we have under our fiveyear revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable longterm needs 

we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital if our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements we may seek additional borrowings prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost and as a result financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all in addition the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed 

we rely on a combination of copyright patent trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period we seek to enforce these noncompete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services including our acquisition of meta that we completed on april 1 2005 the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business 

the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business 

we face risks related to litigation 

we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to taxation 

we operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction may have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes and resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts provided 

risks related to our common stock 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts which typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events which also occur to a greater extent in the fourth calendar quarter the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we have given if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours 

valueact capital and affiliates “valueact” owned approximately 210 of our common stock as of december 31 2007 while silver lake partners and affiliates “silver lake” owned approximately 134 on the same date while neither silver lake nor valueact individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares they may be able either individually or together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and the approval of mergers consolidations and sales of our assets their interests may differ from the interests of other stockholders additionally representatives of silver lake and valueact in the aggregate presently hold three seats on our board of directors 

our stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid 

the trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors variations in operating results developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions general market conditions changes in the composition of our stockholder base changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period such volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stockbased awards as of december 31 2007 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants awarded under these plans was approximately 209 million shares approximately 88 million of which have vested in addition approximately 71 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable without further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by affiliates as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include 

 

these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 

 

 

executive summary of operations and financial position 

during 2007 we continued to execute on the strategy we launched in 2005 to accelerate the growth of our research business while at the same time maintaining the growth and profitability of our consulting and events businesses the cornerstones of this strategy are to produce extraordinary research content deliver innovative and highly differentiated product offerings enhance our sales capability provide world class client service and improve operational effectiveness the success of this strategy is evident in our 2007 financial results which includes total revenue growth of 12 earnings per share growth of 36 and cash flow from operations growth of 40 

we had net income of 736 million in 2007 or 068 per diluted share compared to 050 per diluted share for the prior year the 068 per diluted share for 2007 includes a net charge of 004 recorded in the second quarter of 2007 for certain nonoperating and other items we generated 1483 million of operating cash flow in 2007 and we ended the year with 1099 million in cash 

in our research business we executed on our strategy of accelerating growth by introducing new and innovative product offerings and expanding our sales force revenue was up 18 in 2007 with growth occurring across our entire product portfolio and geographic regions our sales force of 806 associates is up approximately 22 over the prior year end research contract value was 7525 million at december 31 2007 up 18 from the prior year end and was up 14 excluding the impact of foreign currency contract value increased at least 18 in each of the four quarters of 2007 on a yearoveryear basis reflecting the successful execution of our strategy to accelerate the growth of our research business both our research client retention rate and wallet retention rate remained strong at 82 and 101 respectively 

in our consulting business we continue to focus on achieving maximum profitability by targeting the most profitable accounts and geographies revenue from our consulting business was up 6 in 2007 to 3250 million despite lower headcount consulting backlog at december 31 2007 was 1214 million up 11 from the 1096 at december 31 2006 the consultant utilization rate increased 5 points in 2007 to 69 from 64 in the prior year reflecting improved engagement management and reduced headcount the hourly billing rate remained above 350 per hour while the average annualized revenue per billable headcount was up approximately 5 from the prior year billable headcount was 472 at december 31 2007 down about 10 yearoveryear primarily due to the exit from our asian consulting operations 

our events business strategy is to continue to focus on managing the events portfolio by retaining successful events that are content driven and introducing promising new events that will yield greater profitability while eliminating less profitable and less attended events events revenue for 2007 was up 7 with 78 events held in the year as compared to 74 in the prior year with attendance up about 8 in furtherance of our events strategy on february 20 2008 we announced that we had contracted to sell our vision events portfolio of events see note 15 — subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

for a more detailed discussion of our segment results see segment results below 

we also continued our focus on enhancing shareholder value through the continued evolution of our capital structure during 2007 we repurchased 84 million shares of our common stock bringing the total number of shares repurchased since january 1 2005 to 241 million shares in january 2007 we closed on a new credit facility which increased our total debt capacity to 4800 million 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of our symposiumitxpo series that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates 

the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services competition in the industry and other factors the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

revenue recognition — we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

 

the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that have a 30day cancellation clause but have not produced material cancellations to date it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim for those government contracts that permit termination we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract in addition we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were 576 million and 479 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively in addition at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit termination of 108 million and 96 million respectively 

uncollectible fees receivable — the allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and allowance reserve provisions are charged against earnings the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable along with the related allowance for losses in thousands 

 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets — the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 — “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” among other requirements this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis these assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in our financial statements goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following 

 

 

due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty and as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

accounting for income taxes — as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment is made to the deferred tax asset to increase income in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged against income in the period such determination is made 

accounting for stockbased compensation — on january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab no 107” effective with the adoption of sfas no 123r the company is recognizing stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 9 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals — we record accruals for severance costs lease costs associated with excess facilities contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates reserve levels may need to be adjusted in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved additionally we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end 

results of operations 

2007 versus 2006 

revenues increased 1289 million or 12 to 11892 million in 2007 from 10603 million during 2006 excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation total revenues for 2007 would have increased 9 over 2006 

 

 

 

 

please refer to the section of this mda entitled “segment results” for a further discussion of revenues by segment 

revenues increased in all regions revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients increased 8 to 6819 million in 2007 from 6313 million in 2006 revenues from sales to clients in europe the middle east and africa “emea” increased to 4039 million in 2007 from 3377 million in 2006 a 20 increase revenues from sales to clients in the other international region increased 13 to 1033 million in 2007 from 913 million in 2006 

cost of services and product development increased 399 million or 8 when comparing 2007 with 2006 to 5453 million from 5053 million respectively excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation cost of services and product development would have increased 4 the 399 million increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency which added about 170 million of additional expense 182 million of merit salary bonus and fringe increases 64 million of higher event fulfillment costs driven by higher events revenue and additional stockbased compensation costs under sfas no 123r of about 25 million these increases were offset to some extent by lower nonsales headcount and other charges for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 cost of services and product development as a percentage of revenue was 46 and 48 respectively 

selling general and administrative sga expense increased 592 million or 14 to 4753 million from 4161 million when comparing 2007 to 2006 excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation sga expense would have increased by 12 yearoveryear the 592 million increase in sga yearoveryear resulted primarily from increased investment in our sales organization with expenses up approximately 300 million foreign currency translation which added about 201 million of expense and additional stockbased compensation under sfas no 123r of 54 million we now have 806 sales associates a 22 increase over the prior yearend while sga expense increased 14 yearoveryear when salesrelated expenses are excluded general and administrative ga expense was actually down about one percentage point yearoveryear as a percentage of revenue 

depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2007 was 243 million compared to 234 million in 2006 driven by higher capital expenditures we had 242 million and 211 million of capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006 respectively and for 2008 the company projects capital expenditures of approximately 250 million to 270 million 

amortization of intangibles was 21 million in 2007 compared to 107 million in 2006 the decrease was due to certain intangibles acquired in the meta acquisition becoming fully amortized in 2006 

meta integration charges was zero in 2007 and 15 million in 2006 these expenses were primarily for severance and for consulting accounting and tax services 

other charges was 91 million and zero in 2007 and 2006 respectively the 91 million charge in 2007 includes an 87 million charge for the expert choice litigation settlement and 27 million of restructuring costs related to the company’s exit from consulting operations in asia offsetting these charges was a credit of 23 million related to an excess facility which the company returned to service 

interest expense net was 222 million and 166 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in our interest expense was due to a higher weightedaverage amount of debt outstanding in 2007 the increased interest expense from additional debt outstanding was partially offset by a slight decline in rates and higher interest income 

other income expense net was 32 million and 08 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 2007 includes a gain from the settlement of a claim for 18 million while the majority of the other income expense net balances in both years consists of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

provision for income taxes was 406 million for 2007 as compared to 277 million in 2006 the effective tax rate for 2007 was 356 as compared to 322 for 2006 the higher effective tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2006 is attributable to several items the most significant of these items includes the following a the company generated a smaller percentage of its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2007 as compared to 2006 and b differences relating to the release of valuation allowances and changes in reserves 

2006 versus 2005 

revenues increased 7 or 713 million to 10603 million during 2006 from 9890 million during 2005 

 

 

 

 

excluding the impact of foreign currency translation total revenues for 2006 would have increased slightly less than 7 see the segment results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues gartner acquired meta on april 1 2005 and as a result gartner’s 

first quarter of 2005 operating results did not contain meta because meta had been completely integrated into gartner we could not approximate the impact on our 2006 results from the acquisition 

revenues increased in all regions revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients increased 3 to 6313 million in 2006 from 6110 million in 2005 revenues from sales to clients in europe the middle east and africa “emea” increased 14 to 3377 million in 2006 from 2967 million in 2005 revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 12 to 913 million in 2006 from 813 million in 2005 

cost of services and product development expense increased 187 million or 4 to 5053 million in 2006 from 4866 million in 2005 excluding the effects of foreign currency translation cost of services and product development expense would have increased 3 for the year ended december 31 2006 

the 4 yearoveryear increase in cost of services and product development expense was primarily due to charges of 80 million for stockbased compensation under sfas no 123r approximately 60 million of incremental delivery costs associated with continued growth in our events business the inclusion of a full year of salary and benefit expense for former meta employees in 2006 compared to nine months in 2005 and higher compensation costs related to merit salary increases the company adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 under the modified prospective transition method so the prior year excludes such charges in addition to these expense increases cost of services and product development expense for 2005 benefited from the reversal of 21 million of prior year’s bonus accruals for 2006 and 2005 cost of services and product development expense as a percentage of sales was 48 and 49 respectively 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased 5 or 188 million to 4161 million in 2006 from 3973 million in 2005 excluding the effects of foreign currency translation sga expense would have increased by 4 yearoveryear 

the 5 increase in sga expense on a yeartodate basis resulted primarily from increased investment in our sales organization we now have 663 sales associates a 21 increase over the prior year which added approximately 180 million of costs also contributing to the increase were charges of 87 million for stockbased compensation under sfas no 123r and increased recruiting and relocation expenses offsetting these increases were reductions in a number of ga expense categories to include consulting travel facilities and fulfillment in addition sga expense in 2005 benefited from the reversal of 08 million of prior year’s bonus accruals 

depreciation expense for 2006 decreased 8 to 234 million compared to 255 million for 2005 the reduction is due to a decline in capital spending in both the current and prior periods reflecting our focus on disciplined capital spending on projects that support our strategic initiatives 

amortization of intangibles was 107 million for 2006 and 102 million in 2005 of the 256 million of intangibles we recorded related to meta both the intellectual property and database intangibles are now fully amortized with 50 million in customer relationship intangibles remaining to be amortized 

meta integration charges were 15 million and 150 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively these expenses were primarily for severance and for consulting accounting and tax services related to our integration of meta the company will not record any additional meta integration charges in 2007 or later 

other charges were zero in 2006 and 291 million in 2005 the 2005 charges consisted of 106 million of employee severance costs 82 million of charges mostly related to excess office space 60 million related to an option buyback and 43 million primarily for restructuring in our international operations 

loss on investments net was zero and 58 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2005 loss was primarily due to the writedown of an investment in a venture capital fund to its net realizable value the investment was sold in late 2005 at book value 

interest expense net was 166 million and 111 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively a 55 million increase the increase was primarily related to an increase in rates and an increase in the amount of debt outstanding and to a lesser extent higher amortization and writeoff of debt issue costs the weightedaverage interest rate on our debt was 63 in 2006 compared to 49 in the prior year in addition the weightedaverage debt outstanding was about 50 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005 

other income expense net for both 2006 and 2005 consists primarily of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

provision for income taxes was 277 million for 2006 compared to 79 million for 2005 the effective tax rate was 322 and 1448 for 2006 and 2005 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable to several items the most significant of those items include the following a the company generated a larger percentage of its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2006 as compared to 2005 and b 2006 included a significant decrease in valuation allowances for state and local net operating losses while 2005 included a significant increase in valuation allowances for foreign tax credits the impact of these items is partially offset by a benefits taken to reduce overall tax expense in 2005 relating to repatriated earnings no such items occurred in 2006 b larger benefits taken in 2005 as compared to 2006 for foreign tax credits generated and c an overall increase in reserve needs in 2006 as compared to an overall 

decrease in 2005 note that the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2006 

in march 2005 we repatriated approximately 520 million in cash from our nonus subsidiaries also in 2005 we took into account technical corrections issued by the treasury department related to repatriating earnings under the american jobs creation act ajca as a result of favorable provisions in the technical corrections we realized a tax benefit of 36 million in 2005 that reduced the cumulative charge on the repatriated earnings to 14 million in addition as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections we reevaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of 25 million to reestablish valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that will more likely than not expire unused upon filing our 2005 income tax return in 2006 the company determined that it would be more beneficial not to avail itself of the provision of the ajca with respect to the taxation of the repatriation therefore the repatriation was taxed as an ordinary dividend under existing tax law 

excluding the impact of sfas no 123r amortization of certain intangibles acquired as part of the meta acquisition and various meta integration charges the effective tax rate was 324 for 2006 excluding the impact of the amortization of certain intangibles acquired as part of the meta acquisition various meta integration charges and certain onetime charges for facility closures and capital asset impairments the effective tax rate was 366 for 2005 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable to several items the most significant of those items include the following a the company generated more income in low tax jurisdictions in 2006 as compared to 2005 and b 2006 included a significant decrease in valuation allowances for state and local net operating losses while 2005 included a significant increase in valuation allowances for foreign tax credits the impact of these items is partially offset by a benefits taken to reduce overall tax expense in 2005 relating to repatriated earnings no such items occurred in 2006 b larger benefits taken in 2005 as compared to 2006 for foreign tax credits generated and c an overall increase in reserve needs in 2006 as compared to an overall decrease in 2005 the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments was amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2006 

2007 segment results 

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain cost of services and product development charges and selling general and administrative expenses depreciation meta integration charges amortization of intangibles and other charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues 

research 

revenue in our research business increased 1021 million or 18 in 2007 to 6733 million compared to 5712 million for 2006 we had yearoveryear growth across our entire product portfolio and in all of our geographic regions excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency revenue was up about 15 over the prior year research gross contribution increased to 4291 million in 2007 from 3455 million in 2006 a 24 increase while the contribution margin increased 4 points to 64 from 60 the contribution margin improved primarily due to better operating leverage from our stronger revenue performance 

contract value was 7525 million at december 31 2007 up 18 from 6403 million at december 31 2006 the yearoveryear increase was driven by increases in both core research and executive programs and reflects the great success of our new rolebased product offerings we had contract value growth across all of our major geographic regions and client industry segments adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation contract value was up about 14 yearoveryear 

at december 31 2007 our research client retention rate remained strong at 82 up from 81 at december 31 2006 wallet retention was 101 at december 31 2007 up from 96 at december 31 2006 reflecting higher spending at retained clients our executive program membership was 3753 at december 31 2007 which is up about 3 over the prior yearend 

consulting 

consulting revenues were 3250 million in 2007 compared to 3052 million in 2006 an increase of 6 or 198 million despite a decline in billable headcount excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenues were up 3 yearoveryear the increased revenue was driven by substantial improvement in our contract optimization business as well as higher utilization and billing rates in our core consulting business our contract optimization business was weak in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to changes in sales incentives which we have since rectified billable headcount was 472 at december 31 2007 compared to 518 at december 31 2006 a 9 decrease the reduced billable headcount primarily reflects our decision to exit our consulting business in asia 

consulting gross contribution of 1282 million in 2007 increased 6 from 1207 million in 2006 while contribution margin decreased 1 point to 39 in 2007 from 40 in the prior year the decrease in gross contribution margin yearoveryear was driven by lower sas revenue performance and additional investment in senior level consultants 

the consultant utilization rate was 69 and 64 for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the billing rate remained above 350 per hour for both 2007 and 2006 our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was up about 5 to approximately

events revenues for 2007 increased 7 or 114 million to 1808 million compared to 1694 million in 2006 adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign exchange revenues were up about 3 we held 78 events held in 2007 and 74 in 2006 the increased revenue was primarily due to the addition of 10 new events in 2007 and an increase in both attendee volume and ticket prices attendance at events was 44216 in 2007 an 8 increase over 2006 for 2008 we are currently projecting that we will hold 82 events gross contribution was 882 million in 2007 compared to 837 million in 2006 a 5 increase while gross contribution margin was 49 for both periods 

on february 20 2008 we announced that we had contracted to sell our vision events portfolio of events see note 15 — subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

2006 segment results 

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain cost of services and product development charges and sga expense depreciation meta integration charges amortization of intangibles and other charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues 

research 

we had strong revenue performance in our research business in 2006 with revenue up 9 to 5712 million from 5230 in 2005 foreign currency had an immaterial impact on revenue for the year the revenue growth for the year was across all of our regions and client sectors as well as across the entire client portfolio 

both client and wallet retention rates remained strong at december 31 2006 our research client retention rate was 81 the same rate as of december 31 2005 wallet retention was up 3 points from the prior year to 96 at december 31 2006 from 93 at december 31 2005 our executive program membership was 3646 at december 31 2006 compared to 3522 at the prior year end 

research gross contribution of 3455 million for 2006 increased 11 from the 3100 million in 2005 while gross contribution margin increased 1 point in 2006 to 60 from 59 in the prior year the improvement in the contribution margin was mainly due to operating leverage resulting from the strong revenue performance sfas no 123r decreased gross contribution margin in the research segment by about 1 point in 2006 

contract value at december 31 2006 was the highest in the company’s history at 6403 million up 8 over the prior year value of 5926 million excluding the impact of foreign currency contract value increased by approximately 11 contract value has now increased for 12 consecutive quarters the increase was driven by growth in both core research and executive programs 

consulting 

consulting revenues increased 1 to 3052 million in 2006 as compared to 3011 million in 2005 with a strong emphasis on growing the research segment coupled with a decline in revenues in the contract optimization portion of the consulting business change due to a change in sales incentives growth slowed in the second half of 2006 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation revenues were up slightly less than 1 

the yearoveryear revenue increase reflects increases in annualized revenue per billable headcount billing rate and consultant utilization billable headcount was 518 at december 31 2006 compared to 525 for the prior year a decline of 1 consultant utilization rates were 64 and 62 for 2006 and 2005 respectively the billing rate remained at over 300 per hour in 2006 while the average annualized revenue per billable headcount was about 410000 

consulting gross contribution of 1207 million for 2006 decreased 4 from the 1257 million in 2005 while the contribution margin for 2006 decreased to 40 from 42 in the prior year the margin decline was primarily due to costs related to sfas no 123r costs related to exiting less profitable geographies and investments made in senior level hires related to our growth strategy the impact of sfas no 123r which we adopted on january 1 2006 decreased gross contribution margin in the consulting segment for 2006 by approximately half a point 

consulting backlog which represents future revenues to be recognized from inprocess consulting measurement and sas was 1096 million at december 31 2006 compared to 1077 million at september 30 2006 and 1199 million at december 31 2005 

events 

events revenues in 2006 were up 12 or 181 million to 1694 million from 1513 million in the prior year we held 74 events in 2006 with over 41000 attendees compared to 70 events in 2005 with over 35000 attendees the increase in revenue was due to new 

events as well as strong performance from our ongoing events we had 11 new events in 2006 which had higher revenues than the events that were eliminated while revenue from existing events was up 7 reflecting underlying strength in our ongoing summit events excluding the impact of foreign currency translation events revenues were up approximately 11 in 2006 

events gross contribution was 837 million or 49 of revenues for 2006 compared to 761 million or 50 of revenues for 2005 the decrease in gross contribution margin was primarily due to the mix of new events and existing events sfas no 123r had an immaterial impact on the events gross contribution margin for 2006 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 1483 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to cash provided of 1063 million for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of 421 million or 40 the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash from our core operations of approximately 390 million lower cash payments for taxes of about 210 million and to a lesser extent lower cash payments for severance and other items of 50 million offsetting these improvements was a payment of 95 million related to a legal settlement and higher cash payments for interest on our outstanding debt of about 80 million and a higher reduction from excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 56 million 

cash used in investing activities was 241 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 218 million in 2006 the increase was due to a yearoveryear increase in capital expenditures which increased to 242 million in 2007 from 211 million in 2006 

cash used in financing activities increased slightly to 937 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 915 million in 2006 on a net basis we borrowed an additional 240 million in 2007 compared to 1230 million of additional borrowings in 2006 a decrease of 990 million yearoveryear we decreased our use of cash to repurchase shares by 1039 million as we repurchased 1668 million of our common stock in 2007 compared to 2707 million in 2006 we received proceeds from stock issued under stock plans of 345 million in 2007 compared to 467 million in 2006 a decrease of 122 million excess tax benefits from stock compensation increased approximately 56 million to 148 million in 2007 compared to 92 million in 2006 

at december 31 2007 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1099 million the effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by about 116 million during 2007 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 1063 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 271 million in 2005 the increase in cash flow from operating activities of 792 million was primarily due to an increase in cash from core operations of approximately 500 million the improved cash flow also reflects lower cash payments for severance and other charges of about 210 million as well as a decrease of 280 million of payments related to the integration of meta these improvements were somewhat offset by higher cash payments for bonus and to a lesser extent interest and other items 

cash used in investing activities was 218 million for 2006 compared to 1810 million in 2005 the decrease in cash used was primarily due to the net expenditure of 1613 million for the acquisition of meta in 2005 capital expenditures of 211 million was down about 12 million from the prior year period reflecting the company’s continued focus on disciplined capital spending 

cash used by financing activities totaled 915 million in 2006 compared to 700 million of cash provided in the year ended december 31 2005 the decline in cash provided was due to the repurchase of 2707 million of our common shares in 2006 which includes 2000 million repurchased directly from silver lake in december 2006 for which we borrowed an additional 1900 million and utilized 100 million of existing cash during 2005 we had 96 million of common share repurchases we borrowed additional amounts in both 2006 and 2005 and our outstanding debt increased by about 1230 million in 2006 compared to an increase of approximately 560 million in the prior year 

we realized about 157 million more in cash from stock issued under stock plans during 2006 with 467 million of proceeds in 2006 compared to 310 million during the prior year period the increase was a result of our higher stock price during 2006 as compared to 2005 which resulted in more stock option exercises by employees in 2006 we also had 92 million in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation awards under sfas no 123r 

obligations and commitments 

the company has a borrowing arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 1800 million term loan and a 3000 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional 1000 million at our lenders’ discretion the “expansion feature” for a total revolving credit facility of 4000 million however the 1000 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions 

the term loan will be repaid in 18 consecutive quarterly installments which commenced on september 30 2007 plus a final payment due on january 31 2012 and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at our option the revolving credit facility may be used for loans and up to 150 million may be used for letters of credit the revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until january 31 2012 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid at december 31 2007 the company had 1740 million outstanding under the term loan and 2200 million outstanding under the revolver as of december 31 2007 the company had approximately 770 million of available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility not including the expansion feature 

we believe that our existing cash balances together with cash from our operating activities and the borrowing capacity we have under our fiveyear revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable longterm needs 

the following table represents our contractual cash commitments in thousands due after december 31 2007

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” which replaces fasb statement no 141 sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired in a business combination the statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after december 15 2008 which will be the company’s fiscal year beginning january 1 2009 the company is currently evaluating the potential impact if any the adoption of sfas no 141r will have on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statement—amendments of arb no 51 “sfas no 160”” sfas no 160 requires the accounting and reporting of minority interests as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity the statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners sfas no 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements except notforprofit organizations but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary the statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after december 15 2008 which will be the company’s fiscal year beginning january 1 2009 the company is currently evaluating the potential impact if any the adoption of sfas no 160 will have on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” 110 which permits companies under certain circumstances to continue to use the simplified method when calculating the expected term of “plain vanilla” share options originally the use of simplified method was due to expire on december 31 2007 a company may use the simplified method if it concludes that it is not reasonable to base its estimate of expected term on its experience with exercising historical share options although there is no expiration date for sab 110 the sec staff believes that more detailed external information about exercise behavior will over time become readily available the effective date for sab 110 is january 1 2008 the company expects that it will continue to use the simplified method for awards of stockbased compensation after january 1 2008 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2007 we have exposure to changes in interest rates resulting from 1740 million outstanding on our term loan and 2200 million outstanding on our revolver both of which are floating rate borrowings may be either primebased or liborbased interest rates under these borrowings include a base rate plus a margin between 000 and 025 on prime borrowings and between 625 and 125 on libor borrowings 

as of december 31 2007 the annualized interest rates on the term loan and revolver were 571 and 577 respectively which consist of a threemonth libor base rate and onemonth libor base rate respectively plus a margin of 0875 on each 

we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the base floating interest rate on the term loan to a fixed rate accordingly the base interest rate on the term loan is effectively capped at 506 however we are still exposed to interest rate risk on the revolver a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would change pretax annual interest expense on the 3000 million revolver by approximately 07 million when fully utilized 

investment risk 

none 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 

amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact operating results revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk since we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts offset the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these instruments are typically short term and are reflected at fair value with unrealized and realized gains and losses recorded in earnings at december 31 2007 we had 35 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a total notional amount of 2260 million with an immaterial net unrealized loss all of these contracts matured in january 2008 currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included within other income expense net within the consolidated statements of operations currency transaction gains losses net were 11 million 05 million and 28 million during 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future performance 

we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by the economy the following section discusses many but not all of these risks and uncertainties 

risks related to our business 

our operating results could be negatively impacted if the it industry experiences an economic down cycle 

our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in the it industry a general economic downturn or recession anywhere in the world could negatively affect demand for our products and services and may substantially reduce existing and potential client information technologyrelated budgets such a downturn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations including the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates and achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information that can be found on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services 

we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to introduce the new products and services that we need to remain competitive 

the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and approve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial position 

we depend on renewals of subscription based services and sales of new subscription based services for a significant portion of our revenue and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues 

a large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services and new sales of such products and services both to new clients and existing clients these products and services constituted 54 and 53 of our revenues for 2006 and 2005 respectively if we are not able to renew at historical rates and do not generate new sales in an amount sufficient to account for the shortfall arising from a decrease in renewals our revenues will be negatively affected 

our research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

 

additionally as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while research client retention rates were 81 at both december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals 

generating new sales of our subscription based products and services both to new and existing clients is often a time consuming process if we are unable to generate new sales due to competition or other factors our revenues will be adversely affected 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues 

consulting segment revenues constituted 29 and 30 of our revenues for 2006 and 2005 respectively these consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

the profitability and success of our conferences symposia and events could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain desirable dates and locations 

the market for desirable dates and locations for conferences symposia and events is highly competitive if we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences symposia and events their profitability could suffer and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control such as labor strikes transportation shutdowns economic slowdowns terrorist attacks natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services 

our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services and our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name 

we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 

our international operations expose us to a variety of risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth 

approximately 40 of our revenues for 2006 and 38 for 2005 were derived from sales outside of north america as a result our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations differences between us and foreign tax rates and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

the costs of servicing our outstanding debt obligations could impair our future operating results 

in january 2007 we refinanced our debt and we now have a 1800 million term loan as well as a 3000 million revolving credit facility which we can increase to 4000 million the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the credit facility could limit our future financial flexibility the associated debt service costs of these facilities could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed 

we rely on a combination of copyright patent trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the noncompete provision 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services including our acquisition of meta that we completed on april 1 2005 the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business 

we face risks related to litigation 

we are and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal actions such as employment breach of contract intellectual propertyrelated and business torts including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets given the nature of our business we are also subject to defamation including libel and slander negligence or other claims relating to the information we publish regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to our common stock 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts which typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events which also occur to a greater extent in the fourth calendar quarter the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours 

valueact capital master fund lp and affiliates “valueact” owned approximately 199 of our common stock as of december 31 2006 while silver lake partners lp and affiliates “silver lake” owned approximately 127 on the same date while neither silver lake nor valueact individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares they may be able either individually or together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and the approval of mergers consolidations and sales of our assets their interests may differ from the interests of other stockholders additionally representatives of silver lake and valueact in the aggregate presently hold three seats on our board of directors 

our stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid 

the trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to among other factors variations in operating results developments in the industries in which we do business general economic conditions changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period such volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price 

sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders or the threat that substantial sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock furthermore we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units and other stock based awards as of december 31 2006 the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants awarded under these plans was approximately 239 million shares approximately 91 million of which have vested in addition approximately 105 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable without further registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except for any shares held by an affiliate as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include 

 

these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock

on december 23 2003 gartner was sued in an action entitled expert choice inc v gartner inc  docket no 303cv02234 united states district court for the district of connecticut the plaintiff expert choice inc seeks an unspecified amount of damages for claims 

relating to royalties for the development licensing marketing sale and distribution of certain computer software and methodologies in january 2004 an arbitration demand was filed against decision drivers inc one of our subsidiaries and against gartner inc by expert choice the arbitration demand described the claim as being in excess of 100 million but did not provide further detail on february 22 2006 we were informed of an offer from expert choice’s counsel to settle the matter for 350 million we immediately rejected expert choice’s settlement offer the case is currently in the discovery phase we believe we have meritorious defenses against the claims and we continue to vigorously defend the case 

in addition to the matters discussed above we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we believe that the potential liability if any in excess of amounts already accrued from all proceedings claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations when resolved in a future period

we employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our research intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our marketleading position and brand franchise the foundation for our business model is our ability to create and distribute our unique proprietary research content as broadly as possible via 

 

in early 2005 we undertook an initiative to better utilize the intellectual capital associated with our core research product our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research consulting and events a critical part of our longterm strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and analysis we also seek to extend the gartner brand name to develop new client relationships and augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world in addition we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services these initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging campaigning and crossselling of our products and services 

we intend to maintain a balance between 1 pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a strict focus on growing our three core businesses and 2 generating profitability through a streamlined cost structure 

we have three business segments research consulting and events 

 

 

 

we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 

 

 

executive summary of operations and financial position 

our 2006 results continue to reflect our focused execution on our strategy to grow our research business and improve our operational margins 

we continue to invest in our sales capability and our sales force of 663 associates is up approximately 21 from the prior year the research segment benefited strongly from this investment with revenue up 9 in 2006 to 5712 million from 5230 million in 2005 contract value at december 31 2006 was the highest in the company’s history at 6403 million up 11 over the prior year excluding the impact of foreign currency contract value has now increased for 12 consecutive quarters both our research client retention rate and wallet retention remained strong at yearend 2006 at 81 and 96 respectively 

revenue from our consulting segment was 3052 million in 2006 up 1 compared to the prior year consulting backlog at december 31 2006 was 1098 million up about 2 from september 30 2006 but down about 8 from december 31 2005 the consultant utilization rate increased 2 points to 64 in 2006 from 62 in 2005 both the average hourly billing rate and the average annualized revenue per billable headcount remained strong billable headcount was down about 2 from the prior year reflecting our planned focus on operational effectiveness over growth 

our events segment continues to deliver strong revenue growth our continuing emphasis on managing the events portfolio to retain successful events and introduce promising new events continues to yield increasing revenue performance revenue for this segment in 2006 was up 12 over the prior year with increases in both our ongoing events and new events we held 74 events in 2006 compared to 70 in the prior year period and had an overall increase in attendance of 17 

for a more detailed discussion of our segment results see segment results below 

we also continue our focus on enhancing shareholder value through the continued evolution of our capital structure during 2006 we repurchased 158 million shares of our common stock through both open market purchases and direct share repurchases from silver lake in addition in january 2007 we closed on a new credit facility which increased our total debt capacity to 4800 million and in february 2007 our board of directors approved a new 2000 million share buyback program 

on january 1 2006 we adopted the new accounting rule for stockbased compensation sfas no 123r and as a result we are now recording compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted to employees the company awards stockbased compensation as an incentive for employees to contribute to our longterm success and to better align the interests of our employees and our shareholders 

we had net income of 582 million in 2006 or 050 per diluted share compared to a loss of 002 per diluted share for the prior year period and we ended the year with 678 million of cash 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of symposium our flagship event that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign 

currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

revenue recognition — we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

 

uncollectible fees receivable — the allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and allowance reserve provisions are charged against earnings the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable along with the related allowance for losses in thousands 

 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets — the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 — “goodwill and other intangible assets” ”sfas 142” among other requirements this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis these assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit to earnings in our financial statements goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following 

 

 

due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty and as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates during 2004 we recorded an impairment charge of 07 million in the first quarter relating to goodwill associated with certain operations in south america that were closed and in the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 20 million related to the exit from certain noncore product lines 

accounting for income taxes — as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryovers existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 

we operate in numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these audits however resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts provided 

in october 2005 and october 2006 we received irs examination reports showing proposed changes that primarily relate to the valuation of intangible assets licensed to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation of payments under a cost sharing arrangement the company appealed the initial findings and has reached an agreement on the issues with irs appeals office see item 3 legal proceedings for additional information 

accounting for stockbased compensation — on january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab no 107” effective with the adoption of sfas no 123r the company is recognizing stockbased compensation expense which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant over the related service period net of estimated forfeitures see note 10 — stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the company’s common stock price volatility in addition determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions or if the quantity and nature of the company’s stockbased compensation awards changes then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period 

contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals — we record accruals for severance costs lease costs associated with excess facilities contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates reserve levels may need to be adjusted in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved during 2005 we revised our previous estimate for costs and losses associated with excess facilities and we recorded a charge of approximately 82 million primarily due to a reduction of office space in san jose california where we consolidated employees from two buildings into one the charge is included in other charges additionally we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end 

results of operations 

2006 versus 2005 

revenues increased 7 or 713 million to 10603 million in 2006 from 9890 million in 2005 

 

 

 

 

excluding the impact of foreign currency translation total revenues for 2006 would have increased slightly less than 7 see the segment results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues gartner acquired meta on april 1 2005 and as a result gartner’s first quarter of 2005 operating results did not contain meta because meta has been completely integrated into gartner we cannot approximate the impact on our 2006 results from the acquisition 

revenues increased in all regions revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients increased 3 to 6313 million in 2006 from 6110 million in 2005 revenues from sales to clients in europe the middle east and africa “emea” increased 14 to 3377 million in 2006 from 2967 million in 2005 revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 12 to 913 million in 2006 from 813 million in 2005 

cost of services and product development expense increased 187 million or 4 to 5053 million in 2006 from 4866 million in 2005 excluding the effects of foreign currency translation cost of services and product development expense would have increased 3 for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 

the 4 yearoveryear increase in cost of services and product development expense was primarily due to charges of 80 million for stockbased compensation under sfas no 123r approximately 60 million of incremental delivery costs associated with continued growth in our events business the inclusion of a full year of salary and benefit expense for former meta employees in 2006 compared to nine months in 2005 and higher compensation costs related to merit salary increases the company adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 under the modified prospective transition method so the prior year excludes such charges in addition to these expense increases cost of services and product development expense for 2005 benefited from the reversal of 21 million of prior year’s bonus accruals for 2006 and 2005 cost of services and product development expense as a percentage of sales was 48 and 49 respectively 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” increased 5 or 188 million to 4161 million in 2006 from 3973 million in 2005 excluding the effects of foreign currency translation sga expense would have increased by 4 yearoveryear 

the 5 increase in sga expense on a yeartodate basis resulted primarily from increased investment in our sales organization we now have 663 sales associates a 21 increase over the prior year which added approximately 180 million of costs also contributing to the increase were charges of 87 million for stockbased compensation under sfas no 123r and increased recruiting and relocation expenses offsetting these increases were reductions in a number of ga expense categories to include consulting travel facilities and fulfillment in addition sga expense in 2005 benefited from the reversal of 08 million of prior year’s bonus accruals 

depreciation expense for 2006 decreased 8 to 234 million compared to 255 million for 2005 the reduction is due to a decline in capital spending in both the current and prior periods reflecting our focus on disciplined capital spending on projects that support our strategic initiatives 

amortization of intangibles was 107 million for 2006 and 102 million in 2005 of the 256 million of intangibles we recorded related to meta both the intellectual property and database intangibles are now fully amortized with 50 million in customer relationship intangibles remaining to be amortized 

meta integration charges were 15 million and 150 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively these expenses were primarily for severance and for consulting accounting and tax services related to our integration of meta the company will not record any additional meta integration charges in 2007 or later 

other charges were zero in 2006 and 291 million in 2005 the 2005 charges consisted of 106 million of employee severance costs 82 million of charges mostly related to excess office space 60 million related to an option buyback and 43 million primarily for restructuring in our international operations 

loss on investments net was zero and 58 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2005 loss was primarily due to the writedown of an investment in a venture capital fund to its net realizable value the investment was sold in late 2005 at book value as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 03 million of investments 

interest expense net was 166 million and 111 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively a 55 million increase the increase was primarily related to an increase in rates and an increase in the amount of debt outstanding and to a lesser extent higher amortization and writeoff of debt issue costs the weightedaverage interest rate on our debt was 63 in 2006 compared to 49 in the prior year in addition the weightedaverage debt outstanding was about 50 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005 

other expense net for both 2006 and 2005 consists primarily of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

provision benefit for income taxes was 277 million for 2006 compared to 79 million for 2005 the effective tax rate was 322 and 1448 for 2006 and 2005 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable to several items the most significant of those items include the following a the company generated more income in low tax jurisdictions in 2006 as compared to 2005 and b 2006 included a significant decrease in valuation allowances for state and local net operating losses due to expected utilization as a result of legal entity restructuring while 2005 included a significant increase in valuation allowances for foreign tax credits the impact of these items is partially offset by a benefits taken to reduce overall tax expense in 2005 relating to repatriated earnings no such items occurred in 2006 b larger benefits taken in 2005 as compared to 2006 for foreign tax credits generated and c an overall increase in reserve needs in 2006 as compared to an overall decrease in 2005 note that the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2006 

in march 2005 we repatriated approximately 520 million in cash from our nonus subsidiaries also in 2005 we took into account technical corrections issued by the treasury department related to repatriating earnings under the american jobs creation act ajca as a result of favorable provisions in the technical corrections we realized a tax benefit of 36 million in 2005 that reduced the cumulative charge on the repatriated earnings to 14 million in addition as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections we reevaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of 25 million to reestablish valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that will more likely than not expire unused upon filing our 2005 income tax return in 2006 the company determined that it would be more beneficial not to avail itself of the provision of the ajca with respect to the taxation of the repatriation therefore the repatriation was partially taxed as an ordinary dividend and partially as a taxfree return of capital under existing tax law 

excluding the impact of sfas no 123r amortization of certain intangibles acquired as part of the meta acquisition and various meta integration charges the effective tax rate was 324 for 2006 excluding the impact of the amortization of certain intangibles acquired as part of the meta acquisition various meta integration charges and certain onetime charges for facility closures and capital asset impairments the effective tax rate was 366 for 2005 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable to several items the most significant of those items include the following a the company generated more income in low tax jurisdictions in 2006 as compared to 2005 and b 2006 included a significant decrease in valuation allowances for state and local net operating losses while 2005 included a significant increase in valuation allowances for foreign tax credits the impact of these items is partially offset by a benefits taken to reduce overall tax expense in 2005 relating to repatriated earnings no such items occurred in 2006 b larger benefits taken in 2005 as compared to 2006 for foreign tax credits generated and c an overall increase in reserve needs in 2006 as compared to an overall decrease in 2005 note that the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2006 

2005 versus 2004 

revenues increased 11 or 952 million to 9890 million during 2005 from 8938 million during 2004 

 

 

 

 

the effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a 11 million negative effect on total revenues for 2005 compared to 2004 while the meta purchase added approximately 500 million of revenue excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and the meta acquisition revenues would have increased approximately 5 yearoveryear see the segment results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues 

revenues increased in all regions revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients increased 9 to 6110 million in 2005 from 5594 million in 2004 revenues from sales to clients in europe the middle east and africa “emea” increased 13 to 2967 million in 2005 from 2630 million in 2004 revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 14 to 813 million in 2005 from 714 million in 2004 

cost of services and product development expense increased 521 million or 12 to 4866 million in 2005 from 4345 million in 2004 with foreign currency translation having a negligible impact the increase in cost of services and product development expense on a yeartodate basis resulted primarily from an increase in salary and benefits expense of approximately 335 million primarily driven by the addition of 140 people related to the meta purchase and higher bonus expense and sales commissions of 142 million and 50 million respectively the increase in bonus expense reflects the company’s decision to restore bonus payouts to a competitive level in addition we had 53 million of higher conference expenses related to an increase in the number of events and attendees 

cost of services and product development expense in 2005 benefited by the reversal of 21 million of prior years’ bonus accruals additionally cost of services and product development expense during 2004 benefited by the reversal of 35 million of prior years’ incentive compensation program accruals for 2005 and 2004 cost of services and product development expense as a percentage of sales was 49 for both periods 

selling general and administrative expense increased 474 million or 14 to 3973 million in 2005 from 3498 million in 2004 with foreign currency translation having a negligible impact the increase in sga expense on a yeartodate basis was primarily driven by our continued investment in our sales organization we added over 110 new sales associates in 2005 which includes 80 from meta we added 111 people related to the meta purchase including the 80 sales associates accounting for approximately 107 million of the increase in addition to the 107 million increase attributable to meta other salary and benefit increases totaled 121 million while bonus expense and sales commissions increased by 69 million and 70 million respectively also we had approximately 164 million of additional external consulting facilities outsourcing and other charges these charges were offset by the favorable impact of approximately 44 million of lower costs primarily marketing and production sga expense in 2005 benefited by the reversal of 09 million of prior years’ incentive compensation program accruals during 2004 sga expense benefited by the reversal of 33 million of prior year’s incentive compensation program accruals during 2004 the company reduced its allowance for doubtful accounts by 37 million as a result of increased collections and a decline in writeoffs 

depreciation expense for 2005 decreased 8 to 255 million compared to 276 million for 2004 the reduction is due to a decline in capital spending reflecting our disciplined capital spending on projects that support our strategic initiatives 

amortization of intangibles increased to 102 million in 2005 from 07 million in the prior year due to the amortization of the 256 million of intangibles acquired in the meta acquisition 

goodwill impairments were 27 million in 2004 reflecting the writeoff of 07 million of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in latin america and 20 million related to the exit from certain noncore product lines

other charges during 2005 were 292 million which includes 107 million related to workforce reductions 60 million for an option buyback 82 million related to a reduction in office space and 43 million of other charges the company severed a total of 150 employees in 2005 and estimates the annualized savings from the termination of these employees to be approximately 152 million the company has reinvested a significant portion of these savings into improving its products processes and infrastructure to help drive future growth 

other charges during 2004 were 358 million included in this amount was 297 million related to severance and benefits for approximately 200 employees during 2004 the company also revised its estimate of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded 23 million of additional provisions the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases the company also recorded charges in 2004 of 19 million related to the restructuring of certain internal systems and 18 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other noncore operations 

loss on investments net was 58 million and 30 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively these losses were primarily for writedowns of the company’s investments in venture capital funds 

other expense net for 2005 of 29 million consists primarily of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses other expense net of 39 million in 2004 includes the noncash writeoff of 31 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in south america that we closed as a result of this decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 52 “foreign currency translation” 

provision for income taxes was 1448 and 510 of income before income taxes for 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate for 2005 as compared to that of 2004 is principally due to the fact that the company generated less income in low tax jurisdictions as compared to the prior year and recorded valuation allowances against capital losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards the impact of these items is offset in part by benefits taken to reduce the overall tax expense on repatriated earnings as well as reductions for interest costs related to tax contingencies the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2004 

excluding the effect of certain onetime charges the provision for income taxes for the years ended 2005 and 2004 would have been 366 and 360 respectively in 2005 the most significant of these onetime charges included expenses related to the acquisition and integration of meta various capital losses and impairments charges associated with the buyback of under water stock options and severance and facilities reduction charges in 2004 the most significant of these onetime charges included nondeductible goodwill impairment the writeoff of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain south american operations various capital losses and impairments and severance and facilities reduction charges 

in 2004 we took a 50 million tax charge in anticipation of repatriating approximately 520 million in earnings from our nonus subsidiaries in 2005 the repatriation was expected to qualify for a onetime reduced tax rate pursuant to the american jobs creation act ajca the charge was partially offset by a benefit of 25 million to the release of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits that was expected to be utilized before they expired 

in march 2005 we repatriated approximately 520 million in cash from our nonus subsidiaries also in 2005 we took into account technical corrections issued by the treasury department related to repatriating earnings under the ajca as a result of favorable provisions in the technical corrections we realized a tax benefit of 36 million in 2005 that reduced the cumulative charge on the repatriated earnings to 14 million in addition as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections we reevaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of 25 million to reestablish valuation allowances for foreign tax credits that will more likely than not expire unused

contract value at december 31 2006 was the highest in the company’s history at 6403 million up 8 over the prior year value of 5926 million excluding the impact of foreign currency contract value increased by approximately 11 contract value has now increased for 12 consecutive quarters the increase was driven by growth in both core research and executive programs 

consulting 

consulting revenues increased 1 to 3052 million in 2006 as compared to the 3011 million in 2005 with a strong emphasis on growing the research and events segments coupled with a change in sales incentives for the successfee portion of the consulting segment growth slowed from the first half of 2006 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation revenues were up slightly less than 1 

the yearoveryear revenue increase reflects increases in annualized revenue per billable headcount billing rate and consultant utilization billable headcount was 514 at december 31 2006 compared to 525 for the prior year a decline of 2 consultant utilization rates were 64 and 62 for 2006 and 2005 respectively the billing rate remained at over 300 per hour in 2006 while the average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately 390000 

consulting gross contribution of 1207 million for 2006 decreased 4 from the 1257 million in 2005 while the contribution margin for 2006 decreased to 40 from 42 in the prior year the margin decline was primarily due to costs related to sfas no 123r costs related to exiting less profitable geographies and investments made in senior level hires related to our growth strategy the impact of sfas no 123r which we adopted on january 1 2006 decreased gross contribution margin in the consulting segment for 2006 by approximately half a point

research contract value an indicator of future research revenue was 5926 million at december 31 2005 an increase of 16 or 834 million from 5092 million at december 31 2004 approximately half of the increase in contract value is attributable to the meta acquisition excluding the impact of foreign currency contract value increased by approximately 13 the research contract value of 5926 million at december 31 2005 represented our highest reported contract value since september 30 2000

consulting 

consulting revenues of 3011 million for 2005 were up 16 or 417 million when compared to the 2594 million in 2004 with meta contributing approximately 180 million of the revenue growth the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth in our core consulting services as well as in the performancefee portion of our consulting business the increase in the performancefee business for 2005 includes revenues that the company did not expect to close until the first quarter of 2006 and as a result our margin for that quarter will be impacted the growth in our core consulting services reflects our continuing execution of our strategy of focusing on fewer accounts attracting larger deals through integrated solutions and enhancing engagement profitability through improved resource management revenue in 2005 increased despite our exit from certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies in 2004 the effect of foreign currency exchange rates reduced revenues by approximately 1 excluding the impact of meta and foreign currency revenue was up 11 

consulting gross contribution of 1257 million for 2005 increased significantly from the prior year up 36 from the 927 million for 2004 primarily due to higher profitability per engagement as well as the impact of the timing of performancefees discussed above gross contribution margin for 2005 increased to 42 from 36 in the prior year consulting utilization rates were 62 during 2005 as compared to 63 during 2004 while our billable rate was over 300 per hour for both 2005 and 2004 our billable headcount increased to 525 at december 31 2005 as compared to 475 at december 31 2004 an 11 increase primarily related to consultants from the meta acquisition our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately 390000 in 2005 compared to 342000 in 2004

gross contribution of 761 million for 2005 was 96 higher than the 695 million recorded in 2004 as a percentage of revenues gross contribution was 50 during 2005 and 2004 since new events typically run at lower margins in their first year of existence the 15 new events we launched in 2005 had slightly lower margins than existing events however in addition to launching these new events we continued to rationalize our existing portfolio by exiting from events that no longer met our profit targets as a result of this active portfolio management we were able to deliver a flat contribution margin yearoveryear 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 1063 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 compared to 271 million in the prior year period the increase in cash flow from operating activities of 792 million was primarily due to an increase in cash from core operations of approximately 500 million the improved cash flow also reflects lower cash payments for severance and other charges of about 210 million as well as a decrease of 280 million of payments related to the integration of meta these improvements were somewhat offset by higher cash payments for bonus and to a lesser extent interest and other items 

cash used in investing activities was 218 million for 2006 compared to 1810 million in the prior year period the decrease in cash used was primarily due to the net expenditure of 1613 million for the acquisition of meta in 2005 capital expenditures of 211 million was down about 12 million from the prior year period reflecting the company’s continued focus on disciplined capital spending 

cash used by financing activities totaled 915 million in 2006 compared to 700 million of cash provided in the twelve months ended december 31 2005 the decline in cash provided was due to the repurchase of 2707 million of our common shares in 2006 which includes 2000 million repurchased directly from silver lake in december 2006 for which we borrowed an additional 1900 million and utilized 100 million of existing cash during 2005 we had 96 million of common share repurchases we borrowed additional amounts in both 2006 and 2005 and our outstanding debt increased by about 1230 million in 2006 compared to an increase of approximately 560 million in the prior year 

we realized about 157 million more in cash from stock issued under stock plans during 2006 with 467 million of proceeds in 2006 compared to 310 million during the prior year period the increase was a result of our higher stock price during 2006 as compared to 2005 which resulted in more stock option exercises by employees in 2006 we also had 92 million in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation awards under sfas no 123r 

at december 31 2006 cash and cash equivalents totaled 678 million the effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by about 46 million during 2006 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 271 million for 2005 compared to 482 million for the prior year a 211 million decline the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was due primarily to the payment of 350 million of meta integration payments higher employee salary costs primarily related to higher headcount due to the acquisition of meta and to a lesser extent a shift in the mix of our products in the research segment from higher margin core research to lower margin executive programs offsetting these decreases was a 120 million reduction in bonus payments and a decline of approximately 100 million in severance and related payments 

cash used in investing activities increased to 1810 million during 2005 as compared to 290 million in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of meta which was completed on april 1 2005 the company’s net cash investment in meta was approximately 1764 million of cash paid including transaction costs less the 151 million acquired from meta offsetting the cash paid for meta was a decline in capital expenditures which decreased 27 million for 2005 as compared to 2004 and 21 million in cash received from the sale of the company’s investment in si ii and other investments 

cash provided by financing activities totaled 700 million for 2005 compared to 972 million of cash used for 2004 the increase was primarily driven by the borrowing of additional debt in 2005 and cash used in 2004 for stock repurchases 

we had an additional 567 million of debt at december 31 2005 compared to the prior year end during 2005 we borrowed 3270 million and we repaid 2713 million we borrowed 2500 million on june 29 2005 related to the refinancing of our debt 670 million in april under the revolver related to the meta acquisition and 100 million under the revolver of the 2713 million repaid during 2005 we paid 2470 million on june 29 2005 related to the refinancing we made 234 million in quarterly debt payments and we paid 

09 million for a note payable we acquired in the meta acquisition we also paid 11 million in debt issue costs during the second quarter of 2005 related to the refinancing of our debt 

we received proceeds from stock issued for stock plans of 310 million during 2005 as compared to 679 million in the prior year as a result of our higher stock price during 2004 as compared to 2005 which resulted in more stock option exercises by employees in 2004 the company used 60 million of cash including expenses to buy back employee stock options in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 in the fourth quarter of 2005 we used 96 million of cash to repurchase our stock while in 2004 we used 3461 million of cash for a stock tender offer and 61 million of cash for treasury stock purchases 

at december 31 2005 cash and cash equivalents totaled 702 million the effect of exchange rates decreased cash and cash equivalents by approximately 60 million during 2005 

obligations and commitments 

on january 31 2007 the company entered into a new credit arrangement that provides for a fiveyear 1800 million term loan and a 3000 million revolving credit facility which may be increased at gartner’s option by up to an additional 1000 million for a total revolving credit facility of 4000 million the company also drew down 1900 million from the revolving facility and 1800 million from the term loan facility and repaid the 3700 million outstanding under its existing facilities

 recently issued accounting standards 

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab no 108” this sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment sab no 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects on each of the company’s financial statements and related financial statement disclosures the sab permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november 15 2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings additionally the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose the company has recorded adjustments under sab no 108 effective the beginning of the 2006 fiscal year see note 2—adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 108 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in june 2006 the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0603 “how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation” “eitf 0603” the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure eitf 0603 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december 15 2006 the company’s policy is to present taxes on a net basis and as a result the adoption of eitf 0603 will not have any effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which will become effective for the company on january 1 2007 the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for any benefit to be recognized a tax position must be morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities if a position meets the morelikelythannot threshold the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

the fasb is expected to give additional guidance regarding the meaning of ultimate settlement this guidance could have an impact on whether certain reserves related to the ongoing irs appeals case are released through retained earnings upon adoption of fin 48 or through current earnings in a later period while the company’s analysis of the final impact of fin 48 is not yet complete its best estimate is that it will increase retained earnings at january 1 2007 by less than 60 million 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 therefore the company will begin to apply the standard in its fiscal year commencing january 1 2008 the company is in the process of evaluating the impact if any sfas no 157 will have on the company’s financial position or  results of operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas statement no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” this new standard requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status b measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year with limited exceptions and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur those changes will be reported in comprehensive income of a business entity the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december 15 2006 for

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

on january 31 2007 the company refinanced its existing borrowing arrangements by entering into a new credit agreement the “2007 credit agreement” with several lenders the 2007 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 1800 million term loan and a 3000 million revolving credit facility the term loan will be repaid in 18 consecutive quarterly installments commencing september 30 2007 plus a final payment due on january 31 2012 and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the option of gartner the revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until january 31 2012 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid 

loans under the 2007 credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to at gartner’s option either i the greatest of the administrative agent’s prime rate the administrative agent’s rate for threemonth certificates of deposit adjusted for statutory reserves plus 1 and the average rate on overnight federal funds plus 12 of 1 plus a margin equal to between 000 and 025 depending on gartner’s leverage ratio as of the end of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended or ii at the eurodollar rate adjusted for statutory reserves plus a margin equal to between 625 and 125 depending on gartner’s leverage ratio as of the end of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended 

as of midfebruary 2007 we had 1800 million outstanding under the term loan and 1900 million under the revolver at an annualized interest rate of 63 assuming the revolver was fully utilized a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase annual pretax interest expense by approximately 12 million 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2006 we had an investment in an equity security totaling 03 million if there were a 100 adverse change in the value of this equity investment this would result in a noncash impairment charge of approximately 03 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 

amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact operating results revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk since we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts offset the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these instruments are typically short term and are reflected at fair value with unrealized and realized gains and losses recorded in earnings at december 31 2006 we had 15 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a total notional amount of 640 million with an immaterial net unrealized loss all of these contracts matured in january 2007 currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included within other income expense net within the consolidated statements of operations currency transaction gains losses net were 05 million 28 million and 31 million during 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively

note 13 — segment information to the consolidated financial statements within this form 10k includes financial information about our geographic areas and our three business segments research consulting and events 

competition 

we believe that the principal competitive factors that differentiate us from our competitors are 

 

we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services we compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future additionally we face competition from our clients receiving information from free sources through the internet limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in us losing market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures 

intellectual property 

our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies software reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of copyright patent trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights we have policies related to confidentiality and ownership and to the use and protection of gartner’s intellectual property and we also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by the economy the following section discusses many but not all of these risks and uncertainties 

our operating results could be negatively impacted if the it industry experiences an economic down cycle  our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in the it industry a general economic downturn or recession anywhere in the world could negatively affect demand for our products and services and may substantially reduce existing and potential client information technologyrelated budgets such a downturn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations including the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates and achieve contract value and consulting backlog 

we have grown and may continue to grow through acquisitions and strategic investments which could involve substantial risks  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services including our acquisition of meta that we completed on april 1 2005 the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business 

we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information that can be found on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources however we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures furthermore we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price 

we depend on renewals of subscription base services and our failure to renew at historical rates could lead to a decrease in our revenues some of our success depends on renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services which constituted 53 and 54 of our revenues for calendar 2005 and calendar 2004 respectively these research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

additionally as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while research client retention rates were 81 and 80 at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals any material decline in renewal rates could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

we depend on nonrecurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues consulting segment revenues constituted 30 of our revenues for calendar 2005 and 29 for calendar 2004 these consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including the following 

 

any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of our products and services our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services and our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to maintain our existing products and services  we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 

we may not be able to introduce the new products and services that we need to remain competitive  the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial position 

our international operations expose us to a variety of risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth  approximately 38 of our revenues for calendar 2005 were derived from sales outside of north america as a result our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations different or overlapping tax structures higher levels of united states taxation on foreign income and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions furthermore we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 

we may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name  we believe that our “gartner” brand including our independence is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 

the costs of servicing our outstanding debt obligations could impair our future operating results  we have a 2000 million term loan as well as a 1250 million revolving credit facility the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the credit facility could limit our future financial flexibility the associated debt service costs of these facilities could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 

if we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed  we rely on a combination of copyright patent trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the noncompete provision 

we may be subject to infringement claims  third parties may assert infringement claims against us regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 

our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts which typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events which also occur to a greater extent in the fourth calendar quarter the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results furthermore our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline 

interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours  silver lake partners lp “slp” and its affiliates own approximately 330 of our common stock as of february 28 2006 slp is restricted from purchasing additional stock without our consent pursuant to the terms of a securityholders’ agreement this securityholders’ agreement also provides that we cannot take certain actions including acquisitions and sales of stock andor assets without slp’s consent additionally valueact partners and its affiliates own approximately 163 of our common stock as of february 28 2006 while neither slp nor valueact holds a majority of our outstanding shares they may be able either individually or together to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and the approval of mergers consolidations and sales of our assets their interests may differ from the interests of other stockholders 

our antitakeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors these provisions include 

 

 

these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

there are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the sec staff 180 days or more before the end of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports under the securities act of 1934 




 item 2 properties 

our corporate headquarters is located in approximately 213000 square feet of leased office space in three buildings located in stamford connecticut usa these facilities accommodate research and analysis marketing sales client support production and corporate administration the leases on these facilities expire in 2010 however the leases do contain renewal options we have a significant presence in the united kingdom with approximately 72000 square feet of leased office space in two buildings located in egham uk for which the leases expire in 2020 and 2025 respectively we have an additional 25 domestic and 50 international locations that support our research and analysis domestic and international sales efforts and other functions which includes certain meta locations that we have decided to continue to lease as part of our continuing effort to adjust our office space as needs change during 2005 we reduced our office space in san jose california by consolidating employees from two buildings into one building and continued to close or reduce office space where appropriate we continue to constantly assess our space needs as our business changes but we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional space will be available as needed 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

the internal revenue service “irs” has completed the field work portion of an audit of our federal income tax returns for tax years ended september 30 1999 through 2002 in october 2005 we received an examination report indicating proposed changes that primarily relate to the valuation of intangible assets licensed to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation of payments under a cost sharing arrangement between gartner inc and one of its foreign subsidiaries gartner disagrees with the proposed adjustments relating to valuation and the cost sharing arrangement and intends to vigorously dispute this matter through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate however if the irs were to ultimately prevail on the issues it could result in additional taxable income for the years under examination of approximately 1307 million and an additional federal cash tax liability of approximately 410 million the company recorded a provision in prior periods based on our estimate of the amount for which the claim will be settled and no additional amount was booked in the current period although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain we believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations the irs has commenced an examination of tax years 2003 and 2004 there have been no significant developments to date 

on december 23 2003 gartner was sued in an action entitled expert choice inc v gartner inc  docket no 303cv02234 united states district court for the district of connecticut the plaintiff expert choice inc seeks unspecified amount of damages for claims relating to royalties for the development licensing marketing sale and distribution of certain computer software and methodologies the case is currently in the discovery phase subsequently in january 2004 an arbitration demand was filed against decision drivers inc one of our subsidiaries and against gartner inc by expert choice the arbitration demand described the claim as being in excess of 100 million but did not provide further detail on february 22 2006 we were informed of an offer from expert choice’s counsel to settle the matter for 350 million we immediately rejected expert choice’s settlement offer since we believe we have meritorious defenses against the claims and we intend to continue to vigorously defend the case 

in addition to the matters discussed above we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we believe that the potential liability if any in excess of amounts already accrued from all proceedings claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations when resolved in a future period

during calendar 2005 we acquired meta group inc “meta” in an allcash transaction for 1000 per share or approximately 1683 million excluding transaction costs of 81 million meta was a publicly owned premier information technology and research firm that was based in stamford connecticut with about 715 employees in 2004 meta generated 1415 million in revenue from 52 worldwide locations and had 908 million of assets at december 31 2004 the results of operations of meta are included in our consolidated financial results beginning april 1 2005 the date of the acquisition as of december 31 2005 we have fully and successfully integrated meta into our operations 

we initiated and completed several actions during calendar 2005 to enhance shareholder value we simplified our capital structure by eliminating our dual class stock and since july 7 th our common stock has been trading under one ticker symbol—it we believe this change increased the trading liquidity of our common stock for our shareholders in september we completed a buy back of certain vested and outstanding stock options for cash which resulted in the tender and cancellation of approximately 64 million options we undertook the buy back to reduce the option overhang resulting from the high number of options outstanding in october our board of directors authorized a 1000 million common share repurchase program and we repurchased approximately 838000 of our common shares by the end of the year 

we enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during calendar 2005 by amending our credit agreement in addition to increasing our available credit and securing a more favorable amortization schedule we also obtained more favorable covenant terms we also reduced our exposure to rising interest rates on the term portion of the loan facility by entering into an interest rate swap agreement in the fourth quarter of calendar 2005 which effectively converted the base floating rate on the base term loan to a fixed rate we ended calendar 2005 with 703 million in cash which we believe is sufficient to meet our current needs and our stockholders’ equity at december 31 2005 was 1466 million 

we believe that we have stabilized our core research business and will continue to focus on growing its revenues research revenue was up 9 over the prior year to 5230 million revenue was up about 3 excluding the impact of meta and the effect of foreign currency at december 31 2005 contract value was 5926 million up 16 or 834 million from 5092 million at december 31 2004 this represents our highest contract value since september 30 2000 and our second highest level ever in addition the growth in contract value shows increases across all regions as well as across the entire product portfolio our research client retention rate at december 31 2005 increased to 81 from 80 at the prior yearend while wallet retention was down to 93 from 95 over the same period 

consulting revenue for calendar 2005 was up 16 over the prior year revenue was up 11 excluding meta and foreign currency impact and we ended calendar 2005 with a backlog of 1199 million a 7 increase from december 31 2004 during calendar 2005 our average consultant utilization rate was 62 compared to 63 in the prior year while billable headcount increased to 525 at december 31 2005 compared to 475 at december 31 2004 our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was above 375000 

our events business continues to deliver consistent and profitable growth our emphasis on managing the events portfolio to retain our longtime successful events and introduce promising new events has resulted in continued positive revenue performance with calendar 2005 revenue up 9 over the prior year same event revenue also increased up 5 over the prior year contributing to the increased 

revenue was a substantial increase in the number of events with 70 held during calendar 2005 as compared to 56 held in calendar 2004 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our quarterly and annual revenue operating income and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors including the timing of symposia our flagship event that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter and other events the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 

revenue recognition — we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements “sab 101” and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows 

 

the preliminary purchase price allocation of the meta acquisition includes an estimate of the fair value of the cost to fulfill the deferred revenue obligation assumed from meta the estimated fair value of the deferred revenue obligation was determined by estimating the costs to provide the services plus a normal profit margin and did not include any costs associated with selling efforts as a result in allocating the purchase price we recorded adjustments to reduce the carrying value of meta’s march 31 2005 deferred revenue by approximately 126 million consequently revenues related to meta contracts existing at the date of acquisition in the amount of approximately 90 million that would have been recorded by meta had it remained an independent entity were not recognized in calendar 2005 and the remaining 36 million will impact calendar 2006 as former meta customers renew their contracts we will recognize the full value of revenue from those new contracts over the respective contract periods 

uncollectible fees receivable — the allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and allowance reserve provisions are charged against earnings the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable along with the related allowance for losses in thousands 

 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets — the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 — “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” among other requirements this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis these assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit to earnings in our financial statements goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following 

 

due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty and as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates during calendar 2004 we recorded an impairment charge of 07 million in the first quarter relating to goodwill associated with certain operations in south america that were closed and in the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 20 million related to the exit from certain noncore product lines 

accounting for income taxes — as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 

we operate in numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide in any given year in addition our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these audits however resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts provided 

in october 2005 we received an irs examination report showing proposed changes that primarily relate to the valuation of intangible assets licensed to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation of payments under a cost sharing arrangement see item 3 legal proceedings for additional information

contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals — we record accruals for severance costs lease costs associated with excess facilities contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates reserve levels may need to be adjusted in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved during calendar 2005 we revised our previous estimate for costs and losses associated with excess facilities and we recorded a charge of approximately 82 million primarily due to a reduction of office space in san jose california where we consolidated employees from two buildings into one the charge is included in other charges along with severance the option buyback impairment and other costs additionally we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end 

change in fiscal year 

on october 30 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved a change of our fiscal yearend from september 30 to december 31 effective january 1 2003 this change resulted in a threemonth transitional period ending december 31 2002 references to transition 2002 unless otherwise indicated refer to the threemonth transitional period ended december 31 2002 references to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 unless otherwise indicated are to the respective fiscal year period from october 1 through september 30 references to calendar 2006 calendar 2005 calendar 2004 calendar 2003 and calendar 2002 unless otherwise indicated are to the 

respective twelvemonth period from january 1 through december 31 

results of operations 

calendar 2005 versus calendar 2004 

total revenues increased 11 or 952 million to 9890 million during calendar 2005 from 8938 million during calendar 2004 

 

the effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a 11 million negative effect on total revenues for calendar 2005 compared to calendar 2004 while the meta purchase added approximately 500 million of revenue excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and the meta acquisition revenues would have increased approximately 5 yearoveryear see the segment results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues 

revenues increased in all regions revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients increased 9 to 6110 million in calendar 2005 from 5594 million in calendar 2004 revenues from sales to clients in europe the middle east and africa “emea” increased 13 to 2968 million in calendar 2005 from 2630 million in calendar 2004 revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 14 to 812 million in calendar 2005 from 714 million in calendar 2004 

cost of services and product development increased 521 million or 12 to 4866 million in calendar 2005 from 4345 million in calendar 2004 with foreign currency translation having a negligible impact the increase in cost of services and product development on a yeartodate basis resulted primarily from an increase in salary and benefits expense of approximately 335 million primarily driven by the addition of 140 people related to the meta purchase and higher bonus expense and sales commissions of 142 million and 50 million respectively the increase in bonus expense reflects the company’s decision to restore bonus payouts to a competitive level in addition we had 53 million of higher conference expenses related to an increase in the number of events and attendees 

cost of services and product development in calendar 2005 benefited by the reversal of 21 million of prior years’ incentive compensation program accruals additionally cost of services and product development during calendar 2004 benefited by the reversal of 35 million of prior years’ incentive compensation program accruals for calendar 2005 and 2004 cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales was 49 for both periods 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 474 million or 14 to 3973 million in calendar 2005 from 3498 million in calendar 2004 with foreign currency translation having a negligible impact the increase in sga expenses on a yeartodate basis was primarily driven by our continued investment in our sales organization in which we now have over 700 sales associates a 17 increase over calendar 2004 reflecting the addition of 110 sales associates in 2005 we added 111 people related to the meta purchase including 80 sales associates accounting for approximately 107 million of the increase in addition to the 107 million increase attributable to meta other salary and benefit increases totaled 121 million while bonus expense and sales commissions increased by 69 million and 70 million respectively also we had approximately 164 million of additional external consulting facilities outsourcing and other charges these charges were offset by the favorable impact of approximately 44 million of lower costs primarily marketing and production sga expenses in calendar 2005 benefited by the reversal of 09 million of prior years’ incentive compensation program accruals during calendar 2004 sga expenses benefited by the reversal of 33 million of prior year’s incentive compensation program accruals during calendar 2004 the company reduced its allowance for doubtful accounts by 37 million as a result of increased collections and a decline in writeoffs 

depreciation expense for calendar 2005 decreased 8 to 255 million compared to 276 million for calendar 2004 the reduction is due to a decline in capital spending reflecting our disciplined capital spending on projects that support our strategic initiatives 

amortization of intangibles increased to 102 million in calendar 2005 from 07 million in the prior year due to the amortization of the 256 million of intangibles asset acquired in the meta acquisition the majority of the intangibles related to the meta acquisition will be fully amortized by the end of calendar 2006 

goodwill impairments were 27 million in calendar 2004 reflecting the writeoff of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in latin america and other noncore product lines 

other charges during calendar 2005 were 292 million which includes 107 million related to workforce reductions 60 million for an option buyback 82 million related to a reduction in office space and 43 million of other charges the company severed a total of 150 employees in calendar 2005 and estimates the annualized savings from the termination of these employees to be approximately 152 million the company plans to reinvest a significant portion of these savings into improving its products processes and infrastructure to help drive future growth 

during the fourth quarter of calendar 2005 the company recorded other charges of 15 million for costs associated with employee termination severance payments and related benefits for 27 employees in addition during the fourth quarter of calendar 2005 the company reversed approximately 07 million of previously accrued severance benefits because the amounts actually paid were less than estimated during the third quarter of calendar 2005 the company recorded other charges of 60 million related to its completion of a one time offer to buy back certain vested and outstanding stock options for cash see note 8 — equity and stock programs in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information during the second quarter of calendar 2005 the company recorded other charges of 82 million included in the second quarter charge was 82 million of costs primarily related to the reduction of office space in san jose california by consolidating employees from two buildings into one the company also recorded a charge of 06 million associated with certain stock combination expenses which was offset by a reversal of approximately 09 million of accrued severance and other charges that the company determined would not be paid during the first quarter of calendar 2005 the company recorded other charges of 143 million included in the charge was 106 million for costs associated with employee termination severance payments and related benefits the workforce reduction was a continuation of the plan announced in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 which resulted in the termination of 123 employees during the three months ended march 31 2005 in addition during the first quarter of calendar 2005 the company also recorded other charges of approximately 37 million primarily related to a restructuring of the company’s international operations 

other charges during calendar 2004 were 358 million included in this amount was 297 million related to severance and benefits for 203 employees including costs of 77 million related to the departure of our president and coo and our chairman and ceo of the 203 employees 132 were severed as part of the action plan announced in the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 during calendar 2004 the company also revised its estimate of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded 23 million of additional provisions the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases the company also recorded charges in calendar 2004 of 19 million related to the restructuring of certain internal systems and 18 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other noncore operations 

loss gain on investments net for calendar 2005 includes noncash charges of 51 million and 02 million during the first and second quarters respectively primarily related to writedowns of its investment in si venture fund ii lp “si ii” which the company had decided to sell in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 the company recorded the writedown in the first quarter of calendar 2005 to reduce the investment to its estimated net realizable value after receiving preliminary indications of interest to acquire the investment for less than its recorded value the company took the additional writedown in the second quarter of calendar 2005 based on a preliminary sale agreement for which the proceeds were less than the recorded value on august 2 calendar 2005 the company sold its investment in si ii for approximately 13 million with no resulting gain or loss recorded on the sale since the investment was already at net realizable value during the fourth quarter of calendar 2005 the company sold an investment in common stock it had acquired in the meta acquisition for 07 million and recorded a loss of 05 million which is recorded in loss gain from investments net in the consolidated statements of operations 

loss gain on investments net for calendar 2004 was a loss of 30 million in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 the company made the decision to liquidate its equity investments in si venture associates llc “si i” and to sell the company’s interest in si ii si i and si ii were venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to midstage itbased or internetenabled companies of which the company owned 100 of si i and 22 of si ii at december 31 2004 in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 the company recorded a charge of 15 million related to the liquidation of si i to include 08 million for the writedown of the investment and 07 million in related shutdown charges no charges were recorded on si ii in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 related to the planned sale since management believed that the carrying value of the investment approximated its net realizable value in the third quarter of calendar 2004 the company recorded a noncash charge of 22 million related to the transfer of an investment to si ii as well as a decrease in the company’s ownership percentage in si ii of seven hundred basis points the carrying value of the company’s investments held by si i and si ii were zero and 67 million respectively at december 31 2004 

other expense net for calendar 2005 of 29 million consists primarily of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses other expense net of 39 million in calendar 2004 includes the noncash writeoff of 31 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in south america that we have closed as a result of this decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 52 “foreign currency translation” 

provision for income taxes was 1448 and 510 of income before income taxes for calendar 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate for calendar 2005 as compared to that of calendar 2004 is principally due to the fact that the company generated less income in low tax jurisdictions as compared to the prior year and recorded valuation allowances against capital losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards the impact of these items is offset in part by benefits taken to reduce the overall tax expense on repatriated earnings as well as reductions for interest costs related to tax contingencies the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2004 

in calendar 2004 we took a 50 million tax charge in anticipation of repatriating approximately 520 million in earnings from our nonus subsidiaries in calendar 2005 the repatriation was expected to qualify for a onetime reduced tax rate pursuant to the american jobs creation act ajca the charge was partially offset by a benefit of 25 million to release valuation allowance on foreign tax credits that were expected to be utilized before they expired 

in march 2005 we repatriated approximately 520 million in cash from our nonus subsidiaries also in 2005 we took into account technical corrections issued by the treasury department related to repatriating earnings under the ajca as a result of favorable provisions in the technical corrections we realized a tax benefit of 36 million in 2005 that reduced the cumulative charge on the repatriated earnings to 14 million in addition as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections we reevaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of 25 million to reestablish valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that will more likely than not expire unused 

excluding the effect of certain onetime charges the provision for income taxes for calendar years ended 2005 and 2004 would have been 366 and 360 respectively in 2005 the most significant of these onetime charges included expenses related to the acquisition and integration of meta various capital losses and impairments charges associated with the buyback of under water stock options and severance and facilities reduction charges in 2004 the most significant of these onetime charges included nondeductible goodwill impairment the writeoff of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain south american operations various capital losses and impairments and severance and facilities reduction charges 

2005 segment results 

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling general and administrative expenses depreciation amortization of intangibles goodwill impairments income taxes meta integration charges and other charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues 

research 

research revenues increased 9 or 425 million when comparing calendar 2005 and calendar 2004 with meta contributing approximately 290 million and growth in our executive programs accounting for the majority of the rest of the increase the impact of foreign currency was immaterial excluding the impact of meta and foreign currency revenue was up 3 

research gross contribution of 3100 million for calendar 2005 increased from the 2927 million for calendar 2004 while the gross contribution margin for calendar 2005 decreased to 59 from 61 in the prior year the decrease in the gross contribution margin in calendar 2005 was primarily due to increased revenues from our executive programs which have lower margins than our core subscription products an increase in compensation costs mostly due to headcount related to the meta acquisition and the impact of converting meta contract value to gartner contract value we have now transacted on approximately 95 of the meta contract value 

research contract value an indicator of future research revenue was 5926 million at december 31 2005 an increase of 16 or 834 million from 5092 million at december 31 2004 approximately half of the increase in contract value is attributable to the meta acquisition excluding the impact of foreign currency contract value increased by approximately 13 the research contract value of 5926 million at december 31 2005 represents our highest reported contract value since september 30 2000 

at december 31 2005 our research client retention rate increased 1 percentage point to 81 from 80 at december 31 2004 while our wallet retention rate was 93 compared to 95 at december 31 2004 our executive program membership was 3522 at december 31 2005 up 18 from 2975 at december 31 2004 which is attributed to new business growth in north america and emea as well as improved renewal rates and clients obtained as a result of the meta acquisition our executive program membership remains the largest in our industry and has almost doubled in the last three years 

consulting consulting revenues of 3011 million for calendar 2005 were up 16 or 417 million when compared to the 2594 million in calendar 2004 with meta contributing approximately 180 million of the revenue growth the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth in our core consulting services as well as in the performancefee portion of our consulting business the increase in the performancefee business for calendar 2005 includes revenues that the company did not expect to close until the first quarter of 2006 and as a result our margin for that quarter will be impacted the growth in our core consulting services reflects our continuing execution of our strategy of focusing on fewer accounts attracting larger deals through integrated solutions and enhancing engagement profitability through improved resource management revenue in calendar 2005 increased despite our exit from certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies in calendar 2004 the effect of foreign currency exchange rates reduced revenues by approximately 1 excluding the impact of meta and foreign currency revenue was up 11 

consulting gross contribution of 1257 million for calendar 2005 increased significantly from the prior year up 36 from the 927 million for calendar 2004 primarily due to higher profitability per engagement as well as the impact of the timing of performancefees discussed above gross contribution margin for calendar 2005 increased to 42 from 36 in the prior year consulting utilization rates were 62 during calendar 2005 as compared to 63 during calendar 2004 while our billable rate was over 350 per hour in calendar 2005 compared to a 318 per hour billable rate in calendar 2004 our billable headcount increased to 525 at december 31 2005 as compared to 475 at december 31 2004 an 11 increase primarily related to consultants from the meta acquisition our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately 390000 in calendar 2005 compared to 342000 in calendar 2004 

consulting backlog which represents future revenues to be recognized from inprocess consulting measurement and sas increased 7 or 81 million to 1199 million at december 31 2005 compared to 1118 million at december 31 2004 

events events revenues increased 9 or 129 million to 1513 million for calendar 2005 compared to 1384 million for calendar 2004 with approximately 24 million of the increase related to meta changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible effect on revenues when comparing calendar 2005 to calendar 2004 excluding meta and foreign currency revenue was up 8 the revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of events to 70 for calendar 2005 compared to 56 in the prior year period as we added 15 new events in new topic areas and geographies revenue increased to a lesser extent due to continued performance from our recurring events for which revenue was up about 5 year over year the number of attendees at our events increased by about 14 in calendar 2005 compared to calendar 2004 rising to 35502 from 31223 respectively 

gross contribution of 761 million for calendar 2005 was 96 higher than the 695 million recorded in calendar 2004 as a percentage of revenues gross contribution was 50 during calendar 2005 and calendar 2004 since new events typically run at lower margins in their first year of existence the 15 new events we launched in calendar 2005 had slightly lower margins than existing events however in addition to launching these new events we continued to rationalize our existing portfolio by exiting from events that no longer met our profit targets as a result of this active portfolio management we were able to deliver a flat contribution margin yearoveryear 

calendar 2004 versus calendar 2003 

total revenues increased 4 to 8938 million during calendar 2004 from 8584 million during calendar 2003 

 

 

 

 

the effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a 3 positive effect on total revenues for calendar 2004 compared to calendar 2003 excluding the positive effects of foreign currency translation revenues would have increased approximately 1 year 

overyear see the segment results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues

depreciation expense for calendar 2004 decreased 23 to 277 million compared to 360 million for calendar 2003 the decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during calendar 2004 calendar 2003 and calendar 2002 relative to the capital spending during fiscal 2001 and 2000 which led to a decrease in depreciation expense 

amortization of intangibles decreased 46 when comparing calendar 2004 to calendar 2003 due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized since the third quarter of calendar 2003 

goodwill impairments were 27 million in calendar 2004 compared to 0 in calendar 2003 reflecting the writeoff of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in latin america and other noncore product lines 

other charges during the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 were 119 million of which 59 million was for severance and benefits related to a workforce reduction of 40 employees other charges of 43 million during the third quarter of calendar 2004 primarily included severance costs associated with the departure of our president and our former ceo of 31 million and 08 million respectively other charges of 91 million during the second quarter of calendar 2004 included 38 million of severance costs associated with the departure of our former ceo as well as 53 million of costs associated with the termination of 30 employees during the first quarter of calendar 2004 other charges of 105 million were primarily associated with a realignment of our workforce this workforce realignment was a continuation of the action plan initiated during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 and resulted in the termination of 132 employees or approximately 4 of our workforce bringing the total terminations associated with the action plan to 262 employees 

for all of calendar 2004 we recorded total charges of 297 million related to the realignment of our workforce including costs of 77 million related to the departure of our president and our former ceo the realignment resulted in the termination of 203 employees for the full year the annualized savings from the termination of these employees would be approximately 233 million however we plan to reinvest a significant portion of these savings into improving our products processes infrastructure and to fund increases in sales capacity to drive future growth 

additionally during the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded 23 million of additional provisions the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases we also recorded a charge of 19 million in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 related to the abandonment of certain internal systems and 18 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other noncore operations 

other charges of 297 million during calendar 2003 were for costs for employee severance and benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions 54 million during the first quarter of calendar 2003 and 146 million during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 additionally during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded 97 million of additional provisions the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases the workforce reduction that occurred during the first quarter of calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in transition 2002 which resulted in the termination of 92 employees or approximately 2 of our workforce the purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments the workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 resulted in the termination of 130 employees or approximately 3 of our workforce the purpose of this workforce reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations strengthen key consulting practices and align our organizational structure to focus on client needs these remaining payments 

associated with the workforce reduction were completed in the second quarter of calendar 2004 and were funded out of existing cash 

loss gain on investments net during calendar 2004 was a loss of 30 million in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 we recorded a charge of 08 million related to the liquidation of si i in addition we recorded an additional charge of 07 million in related liquidation costs which is recorded in other charges in the third quarter of calendar 2004 we recorded a charge of 22 million for the transfer of our investment in trusecure to si ii as well as a decrease in our ownership percentage in si ii of seven hundred basis points as a result of this transfer and the decrease in ownership we were relieved of all future capital calls which had totaled 40 million see note 3 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

loss gain on investments net during calendar 2003 was a gain of 47 which included a 55 million insurance recovery received during calendar 2003 associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a business also included was an impairment loss of 09 million associated with a minorityowned investment not publicly traded we evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee’s recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value 

the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt to equity during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 decreased our interest expense however due to the new credit agreement signed in the third quarter of calendar 2004 interest expense will increase in the future 

other expense net for calendar 2004 of 39 million includes the noncash writeoff of 31 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in south america that we have closed as a result of this decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 52 “foreign currency translation” other income net for calendar 2003 of 05 million consists primarily of net foreign exchange gains 

provision for income taxes was 510 and 334 of income before income taxes for calendar 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate for calendar 2004 as compared to that of calendar 2003 reflects the impact of a planned repatriation of foreign earnings in calendar 2005 at a onetime favorable tax rate pursuant to the jobs creation act of 2004 

excluding the effect of certain onetime charges the provision for income taxes for calendar years ended 2004 and 2003 would have been 360 and 330 respectively in calendar 2004 the most significant of these onetime charges included nondeductible goodwill impairment the writeoff of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain south american operations various capital losses and impairments and severance and facilities reduction charges in calendar 2003 the most significant of these onetime charges included various capital losses and impairments and severance and facilities reduction charges 

segment results 

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling general and administrative expenses depreciation amortization of intangibles goodwill impairments and other charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues 

research research revenues increased 3 when comparing calendar 2004 and calendar 2003 but excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates revenue was flat 

research gross contribution of 2927 million for calendar 2004 decreased slightly from the 2929 million for calendar 2003 while gross contribution margin for calendar 2004 decreased to 61 from 63 in the prior year the decrease in the gross contribution margin in calendar 2004 was primarily due to increased revenues from our executive programs which have lower margins than our core subscription products as well as continued investment in our people products and processes required to provide research growth 

research contract value an indicator of future research revenue was 5092 million at december 31 2004 an increase of 6 from 4822 million at december 31 2003 with roughly half of the increase due to the effects of foreign currency the research contract value of 5092 million at december 31 2004 represented our highest reported contract value since the first quarter of calendar 2002 during this period we focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core research business this continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter half of calendar 2003 we ended the latter half of 2003 with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract value contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of calendar 2004 decreased slightly during the second quarter of calendar 2004 and increased sequentially again in both the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2004 

at december 31 2004 our client retention rates increased 2 percentage points to 80 as compared to the same measure at december 31 2003 wallet retention increased 6 percentage points during calendar 2004 to 95 while wallet retention rates held steady or climbed 

over the four quarters of calendar 2004 client retention dipped slightly in the first quarter and then climbed for the remainder of the year our executive program membership was 2708 at december 31 2004 up 16 from 2332 at december 31 2003 which is attributed to new business growth in north america and emea as well as improved renewal rates 

consulting consulting revenues of 2594 for calendar 2004 were up slightly when compared to the 2586 million in calendar 2003 excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates revenues would have decreased approximately 4 in calendar 2004 compared to calendar 2003 adjusted for currency effects consulting revenue decreased compared to the prior year as a result of our realignment of our business to exit certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies 

consulting gross contribution of 927 million for calendar 2004 increased 7 from the 868 million for calendar 2003 while gross contribution margin for calendar 2004 increased to 36 from 34 in the prior year the increase in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to higher consultant utilization rates which were approximately 63 during calendar 2004 as compared to approximately 54 during calendar 2003 as the effects of the realignment were realized and the reduction in our billable headcount to 475 at december 31 2004 as compared to 526 at december 31 2003 a 10 decrease our billable rate was 32700 per hour in calendar 2004 a 7 increase from the 30600 rate in calendar 2003 which is due to more efficient use of staff globally and a higher billable rate in emea due to the effects of foreign exchange 

consulting backlog increased 12 to 1118 million at december 31 2004 compared to 997 million at december 31 2003 our consulting business ended calendar 2004 with the continuation of the positive trend that began in calendar 2003 when we ended that year with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases due to the realignment in which we exited certain practices and geographies consulting backlog decreased to 917 million at march 31 2004 but increased to 977 million at june 30 2004 and 1034 million at september 30 2004 as business ramped up in our areas of focus 

events events revenues increased 16 to 1384 million for calendar 2004 compared to 1194 million for calendar 2003 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a 2 favorable impact on revenues when comparing calendar 2004 to calendar 2003 revenues increased despite having one less event during calendar 2004 as compared to calendar 2003 with 56 and 57 events respectively revenue for calendar 2004 increased due to higher attendance and higher average exhibitor revenue resulting in higher average revenue per event in our recurring events attendance at events increased to 31223 in calendar 2004 from 27547 in calendar 2003 a 13 increase which is attributed to the popularity of the topics offered 

gross contribution of 695 million for calendar 2004 was 24 higher than the 560 million recorded in calendar 2003 as a percentage of revenues gross contribution increased to 50 during calendar 2004 from 47 during calendar 2003 the increase in gross contribution margin was due to the mix of events as well as lower personnel and marketing costs also during calendar 2003 we invested more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak economy especially in the technology sector 

liquidity and capital resources 

calendar 2005 cash provided by operating activities totaled 271 million for calendar 2005 compared to 482 million for the prior year a 211 million decline the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was due primarily to the payment of 350 million of meta integration payments higher employee salary costs primarily related to higher headcount due to the acquisition of meta and to a lesser extent a shift in the mix of our products in the research segment from higher margin core research to lower margin executive programs offsetting these decreases was a 120 million reduction in bonus payments and a decline of approximately 100 million in severance and related payments 

cash used in investing activities increased to 1810 million during calendar 2005 as compared to 290 million in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of meta which was completed on april 1 2005 the company’s net cash investment in meta was approximately 1764 million of cash paid including transaction costs less the 151 million acquired from meta offsetting the cash paid for meta was a decline in capital expenditures which decreased 27 million for calendar 2005 as compared to calendar 2004 and 21 million in cash received from the sale of the company’s investment in si ii and other investments 

cash provided by financing activities totaled 700 million for calendar 2005 compared to 972 million of cash used for calendar 2004 the increase was primarily driven by the borrowing of additional debt in calendar 2005 and cash used in calendar 2004 for stock repurchases 

we had an additional 567 million of debt at december 31 2005 compared to the prior year end during calendar 2005 we borrowed 3270 million and we repaid 2713 million we borrowed 2500 million on june 29 2005 related to the refinancing of our debt by 

entering into an amended and restated credit agreement as discussed in note 6 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 670 million in april under the revolver related to the meta acquisition and 100 million under the revolver which was used to make the second quarter of calendar 2005 quarterly payment on the term loan of the 2713 million repaid during calendar 2005 we paid 2470 million on june 29 2005 related to the refinancing we made 234 million in quarterly debt payments and we paid 09 million for a note payable we acquired in the meta acquisition we also paid 11 million in debt issue costs during the second quarter of calendar 2005 related to the refinancing of our debt 

we received proceeds from stock issued for stock plans of 310 million during calendar 2005 as compared to 679 million in the prior year as a result of our higher stock price during 2004 as compared to 2005 which resulted in more stock option exercises by employees in 2004 the company used 60 million of cash including expenses to buy back employee stock options in the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2005 in the fourth quarter of calendar 2005 we used 96 million of cash to repurchase our stock while in 2004 we used 3461 million of cash for a stock tender offer and 61 million of cash for treasury stock purchases 

at december 31 2005 cash and cash equivalents totaled 702 million the effect of exchange rates decreased cash and cash equivalents by 60 million during calendar 2005 and was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the euro and sterling 

calendar 2004 cash provided by operating activities during calendar 2004 totaled 483 million compared to 1363 million in calendar 2003 the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities of 880 million was due to several factors we paid 270 million in bonuses during 2004 compared to zero in calendar 2003 no bonuses were paid during calendar 2003 as they had previously been paid during the quarter ended december 31 2002 but are now being paid during the first half of the year as a result of our change in fiscal year that became effective january 1 2003 as a result the 2003 bonuses were paid in calendar 2004 further we paid a portion of our 2004 bonuses in the third quarter of calendar 2004 in accordance with the current year corporate bonus plan additionally cash from operating activities declined because we paid approximately 140 million more in severance during calendar 2004 than in calendar 2003 the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was also due to the accelerated collection of receivables in calendar 2003 which improved operating cash flow in that year by approximately 260 million which was not repeated in calendar 2004 lastly approximately 150 million of certain accrued liabilities booked in the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 were paid in the first quarter of calendar 2004 

cash used in investing activities increased to 290 million during calendar 2004 as compared to 254 million for calendar 2003 the increase was primarily due to 39 million we prepaid related to the acquisition of meta capital expenditures in calendar 2004 of 251 million were 15 lower than the 289 million in calendar 2003 during calendar 2003 we received an insurance recovery of 55 million and we funded 20 million of our capital commitment to si ii 

cash used by financing activities totaled 973 million for calendar 2004 compared to 30 million used in calendar 2003 we purchased 3523 million of our common stock for treasury during calendar 2004 of which 3462 million represents the tender offer and silver lake repurchases inclusive of related costs as compared to 434 million during the prior year we received proceeds from stock issued for stock plans of 678 million during calendar 2004 as compared to 417 million during the prior year this increase is a result of higher stock option exercises by our employees as increases in our stock price caused a significantly larger percentage of our vested stock options to be in the money during calendar 2004 as compared to calendar 2003 we borrowed 200 million related to the tender in the third quarter of calendar 2004 receiving proceeds net of debt issuance costs of 1972 million we repaid 100 million of this debt in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 

at december 31 2004 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1601 million the effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by 81 million during calendar 2004 and was due to the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the euro and sterling 

obligations and commitments 

the company has a 3250 million unsecured fiveyear credit agreement with a bank group led by jpmorgan chase bank consisting of a 2000 million term loan and a 1250 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility may be increased up to 1750 million as of december 31 2005 there was 1967 million outstanding on the term loan and 500 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2005 the company had approximately 456 million borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 

the term loan will be repaid in 19 quarterly installments with the final payment due on june 29 2010 the revolving credit facility may be used for loans and up to 150 million may be used for letters of credit the revolving loans may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed until june 29 2010 at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid the loans bear interest at the company’s option at a rate equal to the greatest of the administrative agent’s prime rate the administrative agent’s rate for threemonth certificates of deposit adjusted for statutory reserves and the average rate on overnight federal funds plus 1  2 of 1 plus a spread equal to between 000 and 075 

depending on the company’s leverage ratio as of the fiscal quarter most recently ended or at the eurodollar rate adjusted for statutory reserves plus a spread equal to between 100 and 175 depending on the company’s leverage ratio as of the fiscal quarter most recently ended 

the credit agreement contains certain restrictive loan covenants including among others financial covenants requiring a maximum leverage ratio a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum annualized contract value ratio and covenants limiting gartner’s ability to incur indebtedness grant liens make acquisitions be acquired dispose of assets pay dividends repurchase stock make capital expenditures and make investments gartner’s obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by gartner’s us subsidiaries it also contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees inaccuracy of representations and warranties violation of covenants cross defaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency events material judgments and events constituting a change of control the occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of interest by 20 and could result in the acceleration of gartner’s obligations under the credit agreement and an obligation of any or all of the guarantors to pay the full amount of gartner’s obligations under the credit agreement 

in december 2005 the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the base interest rate risk on the term loan the effect of the swap is to convert the floating base rate on the term loan to a fixed rate under the swap terms the company will pay a 4885 fixed rate and in return will receive a threemonth libor rate the threemonth libor rate received on the swap will match the base rate paid on the term loan since both use threemonth libor the swap had an initial notional value of 2000 million which will decline as payments are made on the term loan so that the amount outstanding under the term loan and the notional amount of the swap will always be equal the swap had a notional amount of 1967 million at december 31 2005 which was the same as the outstanding amount of the term loan 

in october 2005 the company’s board of directors authorized a 1000 million common share repurchase program repurchases under the program will be made from timetotime through open market purchases andor block trades repurchases are subject to the availability of our common stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the company’s common stock and our financial performance the company intends to fund the repurchases from cash flow from operations but may also borrow under the company’s existing credit agreement during the fourth quarter of calendar 2005 the company repurchased 837800 shares of its common stock under this program for a total purchase price of 111 million of which 15 million was paid in early january 2006 when the related share repurchase transactions settled 

we believe that our existing cash balances together with cash from our operating activities and the additional borrowing capacity under our amended fiveyear revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable longterm needs 

the following table represents our contractual cash commitments at december 31 2005 in millions including contractual commitments related to the meta acquisition the table excludes interest payments under our credit facility

recently issued accounting standards 

in june 2005 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” “sfas no 154” which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods’ financial statements unless this would be impracticable sfas no 154 supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 20 “accounting changes” which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period’s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle sfas no 154 also makes a distinction between “retrospective application” of an accounting principle and the “restatement” of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error the statement is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r this statement replaces sfas no 123 and apb 25 and will require the recognition of expense for sharebased payments to include the value of stock options and other equity awards granted to employees the revised statement was originally effective for periods beginning after june 15 2005 with early adoption permitted on april 21 2005 the sec issued a standard that amends the date of compliance with sfas no 123r “the sec amendment” under the sec amendment sfas no 123r must be adopted beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant’s first fiscal year beginning on or after june 15 2005 gartner adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 under the modified prospective method of adoption 

projecting the amount of future stock compensation expense is inherently difficult as it is dependent on the type and amount of future awards granted and the volatility and price of our common stock on the date of grant the company is currently reviewing its stock compensation strategy and anticipates that it will make changes to the types of equity awards that it will grant in the future based on our current estimates we project that the adoption of sfas 123r will result in 120 million to 140 million of pretax expense in calendar 2006 which will have a materially negative impact on our earnings 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2005 we have exposure to changes in interest rates since we had 2467 million outstanding on our unsecured credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank with 1967 million outstanding on the term loan and 500 million outstanding on the revolver under the credit agreement the interest rate on our borrowings is libor plus an additional 100 to 150 basis points based on our debttoebitda ratio during the fourth quarter of calendar 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base interest rate on the term loan to a fixed rate accordingly the base interest rate risk on the term loan has been eliminated but we are still exposed to interest rate risk on the revolver however a 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would only have an approximate 03 million pretax annual effect under the revolver when fully utilized 

investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our equity investments as of december 31 2005 we had investments in equity securities totaling 03 million see note 3 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements if there were a 100 adverse change in the value of our equity portfolio as of december 31 2005 this would result in a noncash impairment charge of approximately 03 million 

foreign currency exchange risk we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact operating results revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included within other income expense net within the consolidated statements of operations currency transaction gains losses net were 28 million 31 million and 05 million during 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to offset the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange forward contracts are reflected at fair value with unrealized and realized gains and losses recorded in earnings the following table presents information about our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2005 expressed in us dollar equivalents

 uncollectible fees receivable – provisions for bad debts are recognized as incurred the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience aging of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates these valuation reserves are periodically reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts the following table provides our total fees receivable along with the related allowance for losses in thousands  

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets – the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142  “goodwill and other intangible assets” ”sfas 142” among other requirements this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis these assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we must recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit to earnings in our financial statements goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following  due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty and as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates during 2004 we recorded an impairment charge of 07 million in the first quarter relating to goodwill associated with certain operations in south america that were closed and in the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 20 million related to the exit from certain noncore product lines accounting for income taxes – as we prepare our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question we consider the availability of loss carryforwards existing deferred tax liabilities future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals – we record accruals for severance costs lease costs associated with excess facilities contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates reserve levels may need to be adjusted in addition these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved during the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 we revised our previous estimates for costs and losses associated with excess facilities due to declines in market rates for expected sublease income and revised expected periods of sublease as a result of these revised estimates we recorded a charge for excess facilities of 23 million which was included in other charges along with severance impairment and other costs additionally we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end 11 

impairment of investment securities – a charge to earnings is made when a market decline below cost is other than temporary management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer the valuation of comparable companies and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment’s current carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future we own equity securities through two limited partnerships si venture associates “si i” and si venture fund ii “si ii” which are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to midstage itbased or internetenabled companies at december 31 2004 we owned 100 of si i and 22 of si ii in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 we made the decision to liquidate si i and to sell our interest in si ii in addition in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 we recorded a charge of 15 million related to the liquidation of si i which included 08 million for the writedown of the investment and 07 million in related shutdown charges no charges were recorded on si ii in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 related to the planned sale since the carrying value of the investment approximates its net realizable value in the third quarter of calendar 2004 we recorded a noncash charge of 22 million related to the transfer of our investment in trusecure to si ii as well as a decrease in our ownership percentage in si ii of seven hundred basis points as a result of this transfer and the decrease in ownership we were relieved of all future capital calls which had totaled 40 million total investments in equity securities were 70 million at december 31 2004 and 109 million at december 31 2003 see note 5 – investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements change in fiscal year on october 30 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved a change of our fiscal yearend from september 30 to december 31 effective january 1 2003 this change resulted in a threemonth transitional period ending december 31 2002 references to transition 2002 unless otherwise indicated refer to the threemonth transitional period ended december 31 2002 references to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 unless otherwise indicated are to the respective fiscal year period from october 1 through september 30 references to calendar 2004 calendar 2003 and calendar 2002 unless otherwise indicated are to the respective twelvemonth period from january 1 through december 31 results of operations calendar 2004 versus calendar 2003 total revenues increased 4 to 8938 million during calendar 2004 from 8584 million during calendar 2003     the effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a 3 positive effect on total revenues for calendar 2004 compared to calendar 2003 excluding the positive effects of foreign currency translation revenues would have increased approximately 1 see the segment results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues revenues increased in all regions revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients increased 4 to 5594 million in calendar 2004 from 5357 million in calendar 2003 revenues from sales to clients in europe the middle east and africa “emea” increased 4 to 2630 million in calendar 2004 from 2523 million in calendar 2003 revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 1 to 714 million in calendar 2004 from 705 million in calendar 2003 cost of services and product development increased 6 during calendar 2004 to 4345 million from 4107 million during calendar 2003 excluding the effects of foreign currency translation cost of services and product development would have increased by 2 primarily due to increased investment in our core research business growth in our executive programs and events businesses also contributed to higher costs in calendar 2004 as a percentage of sales cost of services and product development increased to 486 from 478 in the prior year period cost of services and product development in calendar 2004 benefited from the reversal of 35 million of prior years’ incentive compensation 12 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 to 3498 million during calendar 2004 from 3334 million during calendar 2003 sga would have increased by approximately 2 excluding the negative effects of foreign currency translation as a percentage of sales sga expense increased slightly in calendar 2004 to 391 of sales from 388 in calendar 2003 sga expenses benefited during calendar 2004 from the reversal of 33 million of prior years’ incentive compensation as well as a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts of 37 million due to increased collections and a decline in bad debt writeoffs as a percentage of sales depreciation expense for calendar 2004 decreased 23 to 277 million compared to 360 million for calendar 2003 the decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during calendar 2004 calendar 2003 and calendar 2002 relative to the capital spending during fiscal 2001 and 2000 which led to a decrease in depreciation expense amortization of intangibles decreased 46 when comparing calendar 2004 to calendar 2003 due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized since the third quarter of calendar 2003 goodwill impairments were 27 million in calendar 2004 compared to 0 in calendar 2003 reflecting the writeoff of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in latin america and other noncore product lines other charges during the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 were 119 million of which 59 million was for severance and benefits related to a workforce reduction of 40 employees we expect additional workforce reductions to occur during the first quarter of calendar 2005 which will result in an additional severance and benefits charge estimated at between 50 million and 60 million other charges of 43 million during the third quarter of calendar 2004 primarily included severance costs associated with the departure of our president and our former ceo of 31 million and 08 million respectively other charges of 91 million during the second quarter of calendar 2004 included 38 million of severance costs associated with the departure of our former ceo as well as 53 million of costs associated with the termination of 30 employees during the first quarter of calendar 2004 other charges of 105 million were primarily associated with a realignment of our workforce this workforce realignment was a continuation of the action plan initiated during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 and resulted in the termination of 132 employees or approximately 4 of our workforce bringing the total terminations associated with the action plan to 262 employees we expect payments associated with the workforce reduction to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of calendar 2005 we are funding these costs out of existing cash for all of calendar 2004 we recorded total charges of 297 million related to the realignment of our workforce including costs of 77 million related to the departure of our president and our former ceo the realignment resulted in the termination of 203 employees for the full year the annualized savings from the termination of these employees would be approximately 233 million however we plan to reinvest a significant portion of these savings into improving our products processes and infrastructure to help drive future growth additionally during the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded 23 million of additional provisions the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases we also recorded a charge of 19 million in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 related to the abandonment of certain internal systems and 18 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other noncore operations as part of our continuing effort to adjust our office space as needs change we have announced plans to reduce our office space in san jose california by consolidating employees from two buildings into one building in the second or third quarter of calendar 2005 which we estimate will result in a charge ranging from 60 to 70 million in the first quarter of calendar 2005 we plan to restructure certain international operations which we estimate will result in a charge ranging from 40 million to 50 million other charges of 297 million during calendar 2003 were for costs for employee severance and benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions 54 million during the first quarter of calendar 2003 and 146 million during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 additionally during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded 97 million of additional provisions the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases the workforce reduction that occurred during the first quarter of calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in transition 2002 which resulted in the termination of 92 employees or approximately 2 of our workforce the purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments the workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 resulted in the termination of 130 employees or approximately 3 of our workforce the purpose of this workforce reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations strengthen key consulting practices and align our organizational structure to focus on client needs gain loss on investments net during calendar 2004 was a loss of 30 million in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 we recorded a charge of 08 million related to the liquidation of si i in addition we recorded an additional charge of 07 million in related liquidation costs which is recorded in other charges in the third quarter of calendar 2004 we recorded a charge of 22 million for the transfer of our investment in trusecure to si ii as well as a decrease in our ownership percentage in si ii of seven hundred basis points as a result of this transfer and the decrease in ownership we were relieved of all future capital calls which had totaled 40 million see note 5 – investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 13 

gain loss on investments net of 47 million during calendar 2003 includes a 55 million insurance recovery received during calendar 2003 associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a business gain loss on investments net during calendar 2003 also includes an impairment loss of 09 million associated with a minorityowned investment not publicly traded we evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee’s recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt to equity during the fourth quarter of 2003 decreased our interest expense however due to the new credit agreement signed in the third quarter of 2004 interest expense will increase in the future other expense net for calendar 2004 of 39 million includes the noncash writeoff of 31 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in south america that we have closed as a result of this decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 52 “foreign currency translation” other income net for calendar 2003 of 05 million consists primarily of net foreign exchange gains provision for income taxes was 510 and 334 of income before income taxes for calendar 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate for calendar 2004 as compared to that of calendar 2003 reflects the impact of a charge for planned repatriation of foreign earnings in calendar 2005 at a onetime favorable tax rate pursuant to the jobs creation act of 2004 it also reflects the impact of certain nondeductible book charges for workforce reductions excess facilities asset impairments and losses on capital investments these additional charges are partially offset by the release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credits excluding these other charges the effective tax rate would have been 327 in calendar 2004 as compared to 33 in calendar 2003 segment results we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling general and administrative expenses depreciation amortization of intangibles goodwill impairments and other charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues research research revenues increased 3 when comparing calendar 2004 and calendar 2003 but excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates revenue was flat research gross contribution of 2927 million for calendar 2004 decreased slightly from the 2929 million for calendar 2003 while gross contribution margin for calendar 2004 decreased to 61 from 63 in the prior year the decrease in the gross contribution margin in calendar 2004 was primarily due to increased revenues from our executive programs which have lower margins than our core subscription products as well as continued investment in our people products and processes required to provide research growth research contract value an indicator of future research revenue was 5092 million at december 31 2004 an increase of 6 from 4822 million at december 31 2003 with roughly half of the increase due to the effects of foreign currency the research contract value of 5092 million at december 31 2004 represents our highest reported contract value since the first quarter of calendar 2002 during this period we have been focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core research business this continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter half of calendar 2003 we ended the latter half of 2003 with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract value contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of calendar 2004 decreased slightly during the second quarter of calendar 2004 and increased sequentially again in both the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2004 at december 31 2004 our client retention rates increased 2 percentage points to 80 as compared to the same measure at december 31 2003 wallet retention increased 6 percentage points during calendar 2004 to 95 while wallet retention rates held steady or climbed over the four quarters of calendar 2004 client retention dipped slightly in the first quarter and then climbed for the remainder of the year our executive program membership was 2708 at december 31 2004 up 16 from 2332 at december 31 2003 which is attributed to new business growth in north america and emea as well as improved renewal rates consulting consulting revenues of 2594 for calendar 2004 were up slightly when compared to the 2586 million in calendar 2003 excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates revenues would have decreased approximately 4 in calendar 2004 compared to calendar 2003 adjusted for currency effects consulting revenue decreased compared to the prior year as a result of our realignment of our business to exit certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies 14 

consulting gross contribution of 927 million for calendar 2004 increased 7 from the 868 million for calendar 2003 while gross contribution margin for calendar 2004 increased to 36 from 34 in the prior year the increase in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to higher consultant utilization rates which were approximately 63 during calendar 2004 as compared to approximately 54 during calendar 2003 as the effects of the realignment were realized and the reduction in our billable headcount to 493 at december 31 2004 as compared to 526 at december 31 2003 a 6 decrease our billable rate was 32700 per hour in calendar 2004 a 7 increase from the 30600 rate in calendar 2003 which is due to more efficient use of staff globally and a higher billable rate in emea due to the effects of foreign exchange consulting backlog increased 12 to 1118 million at december 31 2004 compared to 997 million at december 31 2003 our consulting business ended calendar 2004 with the continuation of the positive trend that began in calendar 2003 when we ended that year with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases due to the realignment in which we exited certain practices and geographies consulting backlog decreased to 917 million at march 31 2004 but increased to 977 million at june 30 2004 and 1034 million at september 30 2004 as business ramped up in our areas of focus events events revenues increased 16 to 1384 million for calendar 2004 compared to 1194 million for calendar 2003 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a 2 favorable impact on revenues when comparing calendar 2004 to calendar 2003 revenues have increased despite having one less event during calendar 2004 as compared to calendar 2003 with 56 and 57 events respectively revenue for calendar 2004 increased due to higher attendance and higher average exhibitor revenue resulting in higher average revenue per event in our recurring events attendance at events increased to 30999 in calendar 2004 from 27547 in calendar 2003 a 125 increase which is attributed to the popularity of the topics offerred gross contribution of 695 million for calendar 2004 was 24 higher than the 560 million recorded in calendar 2003 as a percentage of revenues gross contribution increased to 50 during calendar 2004 from 47 during calendar 2003 the increase in gross contribution margin was due to the mix of events as well as lower personnel and marketing costs also during 2003 we invested more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak economy especially in the technology sector calendar 2003 versus calendar 2002 total revenues decreased 3 to 8584 million during calendar 2003 from 8876 million during calendar 2002     while revenues declined in the united states and canada region they increased in our emea and the other international regions revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients decreased 7 to 5357 million in calendar 2003 from 5765 million in calendar 2002 revenues from sales to clients in the emea region increased 5 to 2523 million in calendar 2003 from 2413 million in calendar 2002 revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 1 to 705 million in calendar 2003 from 698 million in calendar 2002 the decrease in our total revenues was a result of a decline in demand throughout the entire technology sector and the overall weakness in the economy partially offset by the positive effects of foreign currency exchange rates excluding the effects of foreign currency translation revenues would have decreased approximately 8 see segment analysis section below for a further discussion of segment revenues cost of services and product development increased 4 during calendar 2003 to 4107 million from 3965 million during calendar 2002 excluding the effects of foreign currency translation cost of services and product development would have decreased by 1 as a percentage of sales cost of services and product development increased to 478 from 447 due primarily to investments in gartner exp membership programs product development and costs associated with customer intelligence higher conference related expenses and lower utilization rates for our consulting practice selling general and administrative expenses decreased 4 to 3334 million during calendar 2003 from 3465 million during calendar 2002 sga would have decreased by approximately 7 had it not been for the negative effect of foreign currency translation the 15 

decrease in sga was primarily the result of lower sales commissions and our continued focus on streamlining our support organizations and restructuring efforts depreciation expense for calendar 2003 decreased 18 to 360 million compared to 437 million for calendar 2002 the decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during calendar 2002 and calendar 2003 relative to the capital spending during fiscal 2000 and 2001 which led to a decrease in depreciation expense in addition costs capitalized during fiscal 2000 associated with the initial launch of the gartnercom web site in january 2001 have been fully depreciated as of the beginning of calendar 2003 amortization of intangibles decreased 34 when comparing calendar 2003 to calendar 2002 due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized over the past year other charges of 297 million during calendar 2003 were for costs for employee severance and benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions 54 million during the first quarter of calendar 2003 and 146 million during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 additionally during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded 97 million of additional provisions the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases the workforce reduction that occurred during the first quarter of calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in transition 2002 which resulted in the termination of 92 employees or approximately 2 of our workforce the purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments the workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 resulted in the termination of 130 employees or approximately 3 of our workforce the purpose of this workforce reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations to strengthen key consulting practices and to align our organizational structure to focus on client needs during calendar 2002 other charges were 494 million these charges were the result of two actions one during the first quarter of calendar 2002 amounting to 172 million and the other occurring during the fourth quarter of calendar 2002 or transition 2002 amounting to 322 million of the charges occurring during the first quarter of calendar 2002 100 million related to costs and losses associated with the elimination of excess facilities principally leasehold improvements and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sublease arrangements in addition approximately 58 million of these charges were associated with our workforce reduction initiated during the first quarter of calendar 2002 and were for employee termination severance and benefits this workforce reduction resulted in the termination of 92 employees or approximately 2 of our workforce at that time we expect the payments associated with the workforce reduction to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2004 the remaining 14 million of expenses recorded as other charges during the first quarter of calendar 2002 relates to the impairment of certain databaserelated assets of the 322 million of charges during the fourth quarter of calendar 2002 133 million related to costs and losses associated with our elimination of excess facilities principally leased facilities and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sublease arrangements the remaining 189 million of these charges related to severance payments and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction which included 06 million of noncash compensation this workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of approximately 175 positions or approximately 4 of our workforce at the time gain loss on investments net during calendar 2003 includes a 55 million insurance recovery received during calendar 2003 associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a business gain loss on investments net during calendar 2003 also includes an impairment loss of 09 million associated with a minorityowned investment not publicly traded we evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee’s recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value the loss on investments during calendar 2002 was caused primarily by the recognition of impairment losses related to equity securities owned by us through two limited partnerships si venture associates “si i” and si venture fund ii “si ii” si i and si ii are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to midstage itbased or internetenabled companies at december 31 2002 we owned 100 of si i and 34 of si ii see note 5 – investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the gains and losses on investments interest expense decreased during calendar 2003 due to the conversion of our debt to equity in october 2003 the conversion of our debt has eliminated most of our interest expense since the conversion date other income net for calendar 2003 of 05 million consists primarily of net foreign exchange gains for calendar 2002 other income net of 01 million includes a 05 million gain from the sale of certain assets during the first quarter of calendar 2002 partially offset by net foreign exchange losses 16 

provision for income taxes was 334 and 377 of income before income taxes for calendar 2003 and 2002 respectively excluding the other charges for workforce reductions excess facilities and asset impairments and the gains and losses from investments the effective tax rate would have been 33 in calendar 2003 as compared to 34 in calendar 2002 the reduction in the effective tax rate for calendar 2003 as compared to that of calendar 2002 reflects the implementation of tax planning strategies segment results we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling general and administrative expenses depreciation amortization of intangibles goodwill impairments and other charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues research research revenues decreased 4 when comparing calendar 2003 and calendar 2002 foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted research revenues by approximately 4 the decrease in research revenues was due to the overall weakness in the economy and the impact of this weakness on corporate information technology spending causing lower demand throughout the entire technology sector research gross contribution of 2929 million for calendar 2003 decreased 8 from 3187 million for calendar 2002 while gross contribution margin for calendar 2003 decreased to 63 from 65 in the prior year the decrease in gross contribution and gross contribution margin is a result of the lower revenues and costs associated with investments in gartner exp gartner g2 membership programs product development and marketing and costs associated with customer intelligence research contract value an indicator of future research revenue was 4822 million at december 31 2003 a decrease of 1 from 4890 million at december 31 2002 however research contract value increased sequentially during both the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2003 from 4685 million at june 30 2003 and 4696 million at september 30 2003 prior to these sequential increases during calendar 2003 contract value had decreased sequentially for five consecutive quarters at december 31 2003 our client retention rates increased 4 percentage points to 78 as compared to the same measure at december 31 2002 wallet retention increased 8 percentage points during calendar 2003 to 89 the client and wallet retention rates increased steadily over the four quarters of calendar 2003 consulting consulting revenues decreased 6 during calendar 2003 to 2586 million from 2761 million for calendar 2002 foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of approximately 5 during calendar 2003 the decrease in revenues was caused by lower utilization billable headcount for our consulting business as of december 31 2003 increased to 526 at december 31 2003 as compared to 459 at december 31 2002 consulting gross contribution of 868 million for calendar 2003 decreased 16 from 1028 million for calendar 2002 and gross contribution margin for calendar 2003 decreased to 34 from 37 in the prior year the decrease in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to lower consultant utilization rates which were approximately 53 during calendar 2003 as compared to approximately 56 during calendar 2002 consulting backlog decreased 10 to 997 million at december 31 2003 compared to 1113 million at december 31 2002 but increased sequentially during both the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2003 when it was 910 million at june 30 2003 and 928 million at september 30 2003 consulting backlog decreased as compared to the prior year due to the decline in demand throughout the entire technology sector as technology customers continued to constrain spending events events revenues increased 9 to 1194 million for calendar 2003 compared to 1097 million for calendar 2002 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a 5 favorable impact on revenues when comparing calendar 2003 to calendar 2002 revenues have increased slightly despite having nine fewer events during calendar 2003 as compared to calendar 2002 the average revenue per event increased during calendar 2003 due to the strong performance of our recurring events as well as the addition of new events during calendar 2003 that had higher revenues than the events that were eliminated gross contribution of 560 million for calendar 2003 was relatively consistent with calendar 2002 as a percentage of revenues gross 17 

contribution decreased to 47 during calendar 2003 from 51 during calendar 2002 the decrease in gross contribution margin was due primarily to increased personnel expenses and increased event marketing costs during 2003 we invested more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak economy especially in the technology sector liquidity and capital resources calendar 2004 cash provided by operating activities during calendar 2004 totaled 483 compared to 1363 million in calendar 2003 the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities of 880 million was due to several factors we paid 270 million in bonuses during 2004 compared to zero in calendar 2003 no bonuses were paid during calendar 2003 as they had previously been paid during the quarter ended december 31 2002 but are now being paid during the first half of the year as a result of our change in fiscal year that became effective january 1 2003 as a result the 2003 bonuses were paid in calendar 2004 further we paid a portion of our 2004 bonuses in the third quarter of 2004 in accordance with the current year corporate bonus plan additionally cash from operating activities declined because we paid approximately 140 million more in severance during calendar 2004 than in calendar 2003 the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was also due to the accelerated collection of receivables in calendar 2003 which improved operating cash flow in that year by approximately 260 million which was not repeated in calendar 2004 lastly approximately 150 million of certain accrued liabilities booked in the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 were paid in the first quarter of 2004 cash used in investing activities increased to 290 million during calendar 2004 as compared to 254 million for calendar 2003 the increase was primarily due to 39 million we prepaid related to the acquisition of meta capital expenditures in calendar 2004 of 251 million were 15 lower than the 289 million in calendar 2003 during calendar 2003 we received an insurance recovery of 55 million and we funded 20 million of our capital commitment to si ii cash used by financing activities totaled 973 million for calendar 2004 compared to 30 million used in calendar 2003 we purchased 3523 million of our common stock for treasury during calendar 2004 of which 3462 million represents the tender offer and silver lake repurchases inclusive of related costs as compared to 434 million during the prior year we received proceeds from stock issued for stock plans of 678 million during calendar 2004 as compared to 417 million during the prior year this increase is a result of higher stock option exercises by our employees as increases in our stock price caused a significantly larger percentage of our vested stock options to be in the money during calendar 2004 as compared to calendar 2003 we borrowed 200 million related to the tender in the third quarter of calendar 2004 receiving proceeds net of debt issuance costs of 1972 million we repaid 10 million of this debt in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 at december 31 2004 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1601 million the effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by 81 million during calendar 2004 and was due to the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the euro and sterling calendar 2003 cash provided by operating activities during calendar 2003 was 1363 million compared to 1458 million during calendar 2002 the decrease was primarily due to lower cashrelated earnings and a smaller decrease in receivables during calendar 2003 compared to calendar 2002 cashrelated earnings are income from continuing operations adjusted for the noncash items included in income such as depreciation and amortization the accretion of interest and amortization of debt issue costs along with other noncash charges partially offsetting these decreases were higher bonus payments during calendar 2002 bonus payments were higher during calendar 2002 due to our change in fiscal year from september 30 to december 31 effective january 1 2003 our fiscal 2002 bonuses were paid during transition 2002 or the fourth quarter of calendar 2002 whereas calendar 2003 bonuses were paid during 2004 cash used in investing activities was 254 million for calendar 2003 compared to 263 million for calendar 2002 the decrease was due primarily to the proceeds received from an insurance recovery of 55 million during calendar 2003 associated with a previously incurred loss on a claim resulting from the sale of a business in 2000 additionally during 2002 we spent 39 million to purchase the remaining 499 of people3 inc not previously owned by us during calendar 2003 and calendar 2002 we funded 20 million and 15 million respectively of our investment commitment to si ii reducing our remaining commitment as of december 31 2003 to 40 million spending on property and equipment increased 78 million to 289 million during calendar 2003 as compared to 211 million during the same period of 2002 cash used in financing activities totaled 30 million for calendar 2003 compared to 422 million for calendar 2002 we purchased 434 million of common stock for treasury during calendar 2003 as compared to 599 million during calendar 2002 see further discussion that follows under stock repurchases we received proceeds of 417 million from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of stock by employees participating in the employee stock purchase plan during calendar 2003 as compared to 179 million during the calendar 2002 at december 31 2003 cash and cash equivalents totaled 2300 million the effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents 18 

by 124 million during calendar 2003 and was due to the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies obligations and commitments we have a credit agreement that provides for a 2000 million term a loan facility and a fiveyear 100 million revolving credit facility during the third quarter of 2004 we borrowed 200 million under the term a loan facility receiving net proceeds after debt issuance costs of 1972 million in accordance with the requirements of the term a loan facility we made a loan payment of 100 million in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004 at december 31 2004 there was 190 million outstanding on the term loan facility and 35 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility based on specified covenant requirements our borrowing availability at december 31 2004 under the revolving credit facility was 592 million subsequent to december 31 2004 we entered into an amendment of the credit agreement covenant requirements that resulted in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility as a result the amended borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility would have been 965 million at december 31 2004 the facilities bear interest equal to libor plus an applicable margin which varies based on specified leverage ratios at december 31 2004 the current interest rate was 359 the term a loan facility is payable in equal quarterly installments over a fiveyear period ending august 12 2009 the credit facilities are subject to mandatory prepayments from a portion of proceeds from asset sales and proceeds from certain future debt issuances the credit agreement includes customary affirmative negative and financial covenants primarily based on our financial results and other measures such as contract value the facilities also include commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility not subject to letters of credit on april 17 2000 we issued in a private placement transaction 3000 million of our unsecured 6 convertible subordinated notes due april 17 2005 to silver lake and other noteholders interest accrued semiannually by a corresponding increase in the face amount of the convertible notes in october 2003 the notes were converted into 49441122 shares of gartner class a common stock the conversion was in accordance with the original terms of the notes the determination of the number of shares issued upon conversion was based upon a 745 conversion price and a convertible note of 3683 million consisting of the original face amount of 300 million plus accrued interest of 683 million the unamortized balances of debt issue costs of 28 million and debt discount of 03 million as of the conversion date were netted against the outstanding principal and interest balances resulting in a 3652 million increase to stockholders’ equity additionally certain costs directly associated with the conversion such as regulatory filings banking and legal fees totaling 06 million were charged to equity the following table represents our contractual commitments at december 31 2004 in millions  

on december 27 2004 we announced that we would acquire meta in an allcash transaction for 1000 per share or approximately 1620 million excluding transaction costs while subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals we expect the transaction to be effective april 1 2005 the 17 million of meta acquisition obligation in the table above relates to additional nonrefundable acquisition expenses that we are obligated to pay in order to fund the purchase of meta we anticipate that we will use a combination of cash and our amended fiveyear revolving credit facility in connection with funding the meta transaction we anticipate repatriating 520 million in cash earnings from our nonus subsidiaries in early 2005 we believe that our existing cash balances together with cash from our operating activities and the additional borrowing capacity under our amended fiveyear revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable longterm needs we are currently evaluating the option of establishing longterm debt as a permanent part of our capital structure however there can be no assurances that such capital will be available to us or will be available on commercially reasonable terms tender offer on august 10 2004 we announced the final results of our dutch auction tender offer we repurchased approximately 113 million shares of our class a common stock and 55 million shares of our class b common stock at a purchase price of 1330 and 1250 per share respectively 19

factors that may affect future performance we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in addition we and our clients are affected by the economy the following section discusses many but not all of these risks and uncertainties economic conditions  our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in the it industry a general economic downturn or recession anywhere in the world could negatively affect demand for our products and services and may further substantially reduce existing and potential client information technologyrelated budgets the economic downturn in the united states and globally has led to constrained it spending which has impacted our business and if it were to continue could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations including the ability to maintain client retention wallet retention and consulting utilization rates and achieve contract value and consulting backlog to the extent our clients are in the it industry the severe decline in that sector has also had a significant impact on their spending organizational and product integration related to acquisitions  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services including our pending acquisition of meta the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the ability to integrate successfully the operations and personnel of the acquired business the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired company the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business restructuring reorganization and management team our future success depends in significant part upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel we have recently reorganized our business around specific client needs as part of this reorganization a number of key management positions have been filled by the promotion of current employees or the hiring of new employees additionally we have restructured our workforce in order to streamline operations and strengthen key consulting practices if the reorganization and restructuring of our business does not lead to the results we expect our ability to effectively deliver our products manage our company and carry out our business plan may be impaired on july 23 2004 we announced that the board of directors named eugene a hall as our chief executive officer mr hall succeeded michael fleisher who had previously announced his intention to depart as our chairman and chief executive officer additionally james c smith a current board member has been named nonexecutive chairman of the board of directors further on september 28 2004 we announced that the position of president and chief operating officer previously held by maureen o’connell was eliminated and that mr hall would assume direct responsibility for business operations if we cannot successfully integrate our chief executive officer into our senior management team then our ability to effectively deliver our products manage our company and carry out our business plan may be impaired acts of terrorism or war acts of terrorism acts of war and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to our properties business employees suppliers distributors and clients which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results competitive environment  we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services including information that can be found on the internet free of charge we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources increased competition may result in loss of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer service the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis or price renewal of research business by existing clients some of our success depends on renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services which constituted 54 of our revenues for calendar 2004 and calendar 2003 these research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including those described in this annual report additionally as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while client retention rates were 80 at december 31 2004 and 78 at december 31 2003 there can be no guarantee that we will continue to have this level of client renewals any material decline in renewal rates could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition nonrecurring consulting engagements consulting segment revenues constituted 29 of our revenues for calendar 2004 and 30 of our revenues for calendar 2003 these consulting engagements typically are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace 21 

consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors including those described in this annual report any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition hiring and retention of employees  our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from among others technology companies market research firms consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services and therefore our future business and operating results maintenance of existing products and services  we operate in a rapidly evolving market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results introduction of new products and services  the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial position international operations  a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of north america 37 for calendar 2004 as a result our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations and tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations different or overlapping tax structures higher levels of united states taxation on foreign income and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis additionally clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent branding  we believe that our “gartner” brand is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted indebtedness  we have a 2000 million senior revolving credit facility as well as a 100 million revolving credit facility the affirmative negative and financial covenants of the credit facility could limit our future financial flexibility as a result of these covenants our borrowing availability at december 31 2004 was 592 million and would have been 965 million based on an amendment to the credit agreement the associated debt service costs of these facilities could impair our future operating results the outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital enforcement of our intellectual property rights  we rely on a combination of copyright patent trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the noncompete provision possibility of infringement claims  third parties may assert infringement claims against us regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may 22 

not be offered or available on reasonable terms if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology our business results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected potential fluctuations in operating results  our quarterly and annual operating income may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts which typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter the extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other events which also occur to a greater extent in the fourth calendar quarter the amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may

page

                                                                          10k5

o    the ability to offer products that meet changing market needs at
     competitive prices and

o    our superior customer service

we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of
information products and services we compete indirectly against consulting
firms and other information providers including electronic and print media
companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us
in the future additionally we face competition from our clients receiving
information from free sources through the internet limited barriers to entry
exist in the markets in which we do business as a result new competitors may
emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary

position us well versus our competition increased competition may result in us
losing market share diminished value in our products and services reduced
pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

overview
with the convergence of it and business technology has become increasingly more
important  not just to technology professionals but also to business
executives we are an independent and objective research and advisory firm that
helps it and business executives use technology to build guide and grow their
enterprises

we employ a diversified business model that leverages the breadth and depth of
our research intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our
marketleading position and brand franchise our strategy is to align our
resources and our infrastructure to leverage that intellectual capital into
additional revenue streams through effective packaging campaigning and
crossselling of our products and services our diversified business model
provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client
spending on our research consulting and events a key strategy is to increase
business volume with our most valuable clients identifying relationships with
the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering
strategically relevant research and analysis

we intend to maintain a balance between 1 pursuing opportunities and applying
resources with a strict focus on growing our businesses and 2 generating
profitability through a streamlined cost structure

we have been organized into three business segments research consulting and
events

o    research products and services highlight industry developments review new
     products and technologies provide quantitative market research and
     analyze industry trends within a particular technology or market sector

o    consulting consists primarily of consulting measurement engagements and
     strategic advisory services paid oneday analyst engagements sas
     which provide assessments of cost performance efficiency and quality
     focused on the it industry

o    events consists of various symposia conferences and exhibitions focused on
     the it industry

we have recently begun to undertake a plan to ensure that our business units are
closely aligned with client need and market opportunity as part of that
process we have begun to reorganize our business in to three distinct business
units

o    gartner intelligence will deliver content and advice to it professionals
     technology vendors and investors through vehicles such as research events
     and sas

o    gartner executive programs will offer membership and peernetworking
     services for chief information officers cios and other key executives
     through offerings such as the highly successful exp membership program

o    gartner consulting will focus on customized engagements that allow cios and
     their counterparts to apply gartners knowledge to their specific business
     situations with an emphasis on areas such as outsourcing and it
     management

organizing our business units around distinct client segments will allow us to
make our existing products more relevant accelerate the development of new
products that provide solutions for specific client needs and increase the
gartner value proposition overall

as part of implementing this plan we will be analyzing whether or not it
impacts how we report on our business segments we will continue to report our
segment information as we have historically until we complete the alignment of
our financial reporting to this new structure and can then analyze what impact
if any this alignment will have

we believe the following business measurements are important performance
indicators for our business segments




revenue category   business measurements

                
research           contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscriptionrelated research products
                   that recognize revenue on a ratable basis contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all
                   subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time without regard to the duration of
                   the contract

                   client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships
                   at a specific point in time client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current
                   clients who were also clients a year ago by all clients from a year ago

                   wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with
                   clients over a twelvemonth period wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing
                   the contract value of clients who were clients one year earlier by the total contract value from a
                   year earlier when wallet retention exceeds client retention it is an indication of retention of higher
                   spending clients

consulting         consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from inprocess consulting
                   measurement and strategic advisory services engagements

                   utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants utilization rates are
                   calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours
                   available to bill

events             number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period


executive summary of operations and financial position
technology spending has decreased steadily over the past few years as a result
sales of our it related research have declined as well during this period we
have been focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core research
business this continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the
latter half of calendar 2003 we ended the latter half of 2003 with two
consecutive quarters of sequential increases in contract value after seven
consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract value our research
client retention rates steadily increased to 78 at december 31 2003 from 74
at december 31 2002 we believe the technology market is showing signs of a
recovery and we believe the realignment of our business units discussed
previously will help us grow during this expected recovery

our consulting business also ended the year with a positive trend we ended
calendar 2003 with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog
after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases as part of the
realignment previously discussed we will be exiting certain less profitable
consulting practices and geographies we expect this realignment to address our
suboptimal utilization rates and our lack of scale in some regions

our events business continues to deliver strong results particularly in an
environment where few competitors have survived our emphasis on managing the
events portfolio to retain our longtime successful events and introduce
promising new events has resulted in improved revenue performance we achieved
these results while hosting fewer events 57 during calendar 2003 which was
nine fewer than calendar 2002

during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 we made an important change to our
capital structure our 6 convertible notes were converted into class a common
stock this eliminated all of our outstanding debt and the related interest
expense and we ended the year with 376 million of stockholders equity in
addition our cash increased from 110 million at december 31 2002 to 230
million at december 31 2003 while repurchasing 43 million of our common
stock we have strong financial resources to support additional investments in
growth

fluctuations in quarterly operating results
our quarterly and annual revenue and operating income fluctuate as a result of
many factors including the timing of symposia our flagship event that
normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter and other events the amount
of new business generated the mix of domestic and international business
changes in market demand for our products and services changes in foreign
currency rates the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new
products and services and competition in the industry the potential
fluctuations in our operating income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of
operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable
indication of future operating results

critical accounting policies and estimates
the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate
accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1
in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the
policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial
statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgements
and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are
described below

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff
accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab
101 revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows

o    research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research
     products revenues from research products are deferred and recognized
     ratably over the applicable contract term

o    consulting revenues are based primarily on fixed fees or time and materials
     for discrete projects revenues for such projects are recognized as work is
     delivered andor services are provided and are evaluated on a contract by
     contract basis

o    events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the
     related symposium conference or exhibition and

o    other revenues principally software licensing fees are recognized when a
     signed noncancelable software license exists delivery has occurred
     collection is probable and the fees are fixed or determinable revenue
     from software maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the term
     of the maintenance agreement which is typically twelve months

uncollectible fees receivable  provisions for bad debts are recognized as
incurred the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for
uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience aging of
outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the
financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental
and requires material estimates these valuation reserves are periodically
reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility
of fees receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our
valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and
credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay
their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection
efforts the following tables provides our total fees receivables along with
the related allowance for losses in thousands

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  the evaluation of goodwill
is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no
142  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 among other
requirements this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and
requires an annual assessment for goodwill impairment the evaluation of other
intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis
page

10k12

these assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our
reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and
economic conditions in developing longterm forecasts if we determine that the
fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we must
recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of that reporting
unit to earnings in our financial statements goodwill is evaluated for
impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider
important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following

o    significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future
     operating results

o    significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the
     strategy for our overall business

o    significant negative industry or economic trends

o    significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and

o    our market capitalization relative to net book value

due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions
relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in
circumstances affecting these valuations both the precision and reliability of
the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty and as additional
information becomes known we may change our estimates

accounting for income taxes  as we prepare our consolidated financial
statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we
operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with
assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for
tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and
liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we record
a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization
is in question we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation
allowance in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our
deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an
adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such
determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able
to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an
adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such
determination was made

contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals  we establish reserves for
severance costs contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of
actions we undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain
businesses and reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to
complete these actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair
value of assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at
the time the actions are initiated to the extent actual costs differ from those
estimates reserve levels may need to be adjusted in addition these actions
may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at
the time such plans were approved during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003
we revised our previous estimates for costs and losses associated with excess
facilities due to declines in market rates for expected sublease income and
revised expected periods of sublease as a result of these revised estimates we
recorded a charge of 97 million which was included in other charges along
with severance costs additionally we record accruals for estimated incentive
compensation costs during the year the ultimate amount paid associated with
these incentives are sometimes not known until after yearend during the fourth
quarter of calendar 2003 we lowered our estimates for incentive compensation
accruals including bonuses based on company performance by approximately 32
million as compared to the estimates recorded as of the end of the third quarter
of calendar 2003

impairment of investment securities  a charge to earnings is made when a market
decline below cost is other than temporary management regularly reviews each
investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the length of
time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost the financial
condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer the valuation of comparable
companies and our intent and ability to retain

                                                                         10k13

the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in market value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor
operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an
inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be
reflected in an investments current carrying value thereby possibly requiring
an impairment charge in the future total investments in equity securities were
109 million at december 31 2003 107 million at december 31 2002 and
127 million at september 30 2002 see note 4  investments in the notes to
the consolidated financial statements

change in fiscal year
on october 30 2002 we announced that the board of directors approved a change
of our fiscal yearend from september 30 to december 31 effective january 1
2003 this change resulted in a threemonth transitional period ending december
31 2002 references to transition 2002 unless otherwise indicated refer to
the threemonth transitional period ended december 31 2002 references to
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 unless otherwise indicated are to the respective
fiscal year period from october 1 through september 30 references to calendar
2003 and calendar 2002 unless otherwise indicated are to the respective
twelvemonth period from january 1 through december 31

results of operations

calendar 2003 versus calendar 2002

total revenues decreased 3 to 8584 million during calendar 2003 from 8876
million during calendar 2002

o    research revenues decreased 4 in calendar 2003 to 4669 million compared
     to 4870 million in calendar 2002 and comprised approximately 54 and 55
     of total revenues in calendar 2003 and calendar 2002 respectively

o    consulting revenues decreased 6 to 2586 million in calendar 2003
     compared to 2761 million in calendar 2002 and comprised approximately
     30 and 31 of total revenues in calendar 2003 and calendar 2002
     respectively

o    events revenues were 1194 million in calendar 2003 an increase of 9
     from the 1097 million in calendar 2002 and comprised approximately 14
     of total revenues in calendar 2003 versus 12 in calendar 2002

o    other revenues consisting principally of software licensing and
     maintenance fees decreased 9 to 136 million in calendar 2003 from 149
     million in calendar 2002

while revenues declined in the united states and canada region they increased
in our europe middle east and africa region emea and the other
international region revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients
decreased 7 to 5357 million in calendar 2003 from 5765 million in calendar
2002 revenues from sales to clients in the emea region increased 5 to 2523
million in calendar 2003 from 2413 million in calendar 2002 revenues from
sales to clients in other international regions increased 1 to 705 million in
calendar 2003 from 698 million in calendar 2002

the decrease in our total revenues was a result of a decline in demand
throughout the entire technology sector and the overall weakness in the economy
partially offset by the positive effects of foreign currency exchange rates
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation revenues would have
decreased approximately 8 see segment analysis section below for a further
discussion of segment revenues

cost of services and product development increased 4 during calendar 2003 to
4107 million from 3965 million during calendar 2002 excluding the effects
of foreign currency translation cost of services and product development would
have decreased by 1 as a percentage of sales cost of services and product
development increased to 478 from 447 due primarily to investments in
gartner exp membership programs product development and costs associated with
customer intelligence higher conference related expenses and lower utilization
rates for our consulting practice

page

10k14

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 4 to 3333 million
during calendar 2003 from 3465 million during calendar 2002 sga would have
decreased by approximately 7 had it not been for the negative effect of foreign
currency translation the decrease in sga was primarily the result of lower
sales commissions and our continued focus on streamlining our support
organizations and restructuring efforts

depreciation expense for calendar 2003 decreased 18 to 360 million compared
to 437 million for calendar 2002 the decrease was due to a reduction in
capital spending during calendar 2002 and calendar 2003 relative to the capital
spending during fiscal 2000 and 2001 which led to a decrease in depreciation
expense in addition costs capitalized during fiscal 2000 associated with the
initial launch of the gartnercom web site in january 2001 have been fully
depreciated as of the beginning of calendar 2003

amortization of intangibles decreased 34 when comparing calendar 2003 to
calendar 2002 due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized over
the past year

other charges of 297 million during calendar 2003 were for costs for employee
severance and benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two
separate actions 54 million during the first quarter of calendar 2003 and
146 million during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 additionally during
the fourth quarter of calendar 2003 we revised our estimates of previously
recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded 97
million of additional provisions the revised estimate was due to a decline in
market lease rates for expected subleases as well as a reduction in estimated
periods of subleases the workforce reduction that occurred during the first
quarter of calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in transition
2002 which resulted in the termination of 92 employees or approximately 2 of
our workforce the purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in
underperforming segments the workforce reduction that occurred during the
fourth quarter of calendar 2003 resulted in the termination of 130 employees or
approximately 3 of our workforce the purpose of this workforce reduction was
part of an effort to streamline operations to strengthen key consulting
practices and to align our organizational structure to focus on client needs
we expect the remaining payments associated with the workforce reduction to be
substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2004 we are funding
all of these costs out of existing cash we expect to record additional expenses
for severance during the first quarter of 2004 of approximately 5 million to 8
million associated with the realignment plan initiated during the fourth quarter
of calendar 2003

during calendar 2002 other charges were 494 million these charges were the
result of two actions one during the first quarter of calendar 2002 amounting
to 172 million and the other occurring during the fourth quarter of calendar
2002 or transition 2002 amounting to 322 million of the charges occurring
during the first quarter of calendar 2002 100 million related to costs and
losses associated with the elimination of excess facilities principally
leasehold improvements and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with
sublease arrangements in addition approximately 58 million of these charges
were associated with our workforce reduction initiated during the first quarter
of calendar 2002 and were for employee termination severance and benefits this
workforce reduction resulted in the termination of 92 employees or
approximately 2 of the companys workforce at that time we expect the payments
associated with the workforce reduction to be completed by the end of the first
quarter of 2004 the remaining 14 million of expenses recorded as other
charges during the first quarter of calendar 2002 relates to the impairment of
certain databaserelated assets of the 322 million of charges during the
fourth quarter of calendar 2002 133 million related to costs and losses
associated with our elimination of excess facilities principally leased
facilities and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sublease
arrangements the remaining 189 million of these charges related to severance
payments and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction which
included 06 million of noncash compensation this workforce reduction
resulted in the elimination of approximately 175 positions or approximately 4
of our workforce at the time we are funding all of the remaining costs out of
existing cash

interest expense decreased during calendar 2003 due to the conversion of our
debt to equity in october 2003 the conversion of our debt has eliminated most
of our interest expense since the conversion date

                                                                         10k15

gain loss on investments net during calendar 2003 includes a 55 million
insurance recovery received during calendar 2003 associated with previously
incurred losses arising from the sale of a business gain loss on investments
net during calendar 2003 also includes an impairment loss of 09 million
associated with a minorityowned investment not publicly traded we evaluated
the investment for impairment because of the investees recapitalization due to
its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity which
led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value the loss on
investments during calendar 2002 was caused primarily by the recognition of
impairment losses related to equity securities owned by us through two limited
partnerships si venture associates si i and si venture fund ii si ii
si i and si ii are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early
to midstage itbased or internetenabled companies we own 100 of si i and 34
of si ii see note 4  investments in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements for a further discussion of the gains and losses on investments the
impairment factors evaluated by management may change in subsequent periods
given that the entities underlying these investments operate in a volatile
business environment in addition these entities may require additional
financing to meet their cash and operational needs however there can be no
assurance that such funds will be available to the extent needed at terms
acceptable to the entities if at all this could result in additional material
noncash impairment charges in the future

other income net for calendar 2003 of 05 million consists primarily of net
foreign exchange gains for calendar 2002 other income net of 01 million
includes a 05 million gain from the sale of certain assets during the first
quarter of calendar 2002 partially offset by net foreign exchange losses

provision for income taxes was 334 and 377 of income before income taxes for
calendar 2003 and 2002 respectively excluding the other charges for workforce
reductions excess facilities and asset impairments and the gains and losses
from investments the effective tax rate would have been 33 in calendar 2003 as
compared to 34 in calendar 2002 the reduction in the effective tax rate for
calendar 2003 as compared to that of calendar 2002 reflects the implementation
of tax planning strategies

basic and diluted income per common share was 026 for calendar 2003 compared
to 018 for calendar 2002 for calendar 2003 basic and diluted eps were
negatively impacted by our restructuring costs and the impairment of an
investment partially offsetting these items was the favorable impact of the
insurance recovery during calendar 2002 the restructuring charges and
impairment of investments had an unfavorable impact on basic and diluted eps

segment results

during calendar 2003 our business was managed through three reportable
segments research consulting and events as announced in the fourth quarter of
2003 we are moving toward a client focus and realigning our business into three
business units gartner intelligence gartner executive programs and gartner
consulting as this realignment is finalized during 2004 we will evaluate the
needs if any to realign our segment reporting our segment discussion is based
on our historical segments as managed through 2003

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross
contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding
certain selling general and administrative expenses depreciation amortization
of intangibles and other charges gross contribution margin is defined as gross
contribution as a percentage of revenues

research
research revenues decreased 4 when comparing calendar 2003 and calendar 2002
foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted research revenues by
approximately 4 the decrease in research revenues was due to the overall
weakness in the economy and the impact of this weakness on corporate information
technology spending causing lower demand throughout the entire technology
sector

page

10k16

research gross contribution of 2929 million for calendar 2003 decreased 8
from 3187 million for calendar 2002 while gross contribution margin for
calendar 2003 decreased to 63 from 65 in the prior year the decrease in gross
contribution and gross contribution margin is a result of the lower revenues and
costs associated with investments in gartner exp gartner g2 membership
programs product development and marketing and costs associated with customer
intelligence

research contract value an indicator of future research revenue was 4822
million at december 31 2003 a decrease of 1 from 4890 million at december
31 2002 however research contract value increased sequentially during both
the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2003 from 4685 million at june 30
2003 and 4696 million at september 30 2003 prior to these sequential
increases during calendar 2003 contract value had decreased sequentially for
seven consecutive quarters we believe these sequential increases may be an
indication of an upturn in demand for our products coinciding with potentially
increasing demand in the technology sector at december 31 2003 our client
retention rates increased 4 percentage points to 78 as compared to the same
measure at december 31 2002 wallet retention increased 8 percentage points
during calendar 2003 to 89 the client and wallet retention rates increased
steadily over the four quarters of calendar 2003 we believe these increases
were a result of implementing a named account sales strategy with our sales
staff and the focusing of their efforts on companies with revenues greater than
1 billion

consulting
consulting revenues decreased 6 during calendar 2003 to 2586 million from
2761 million for calendar 2002 foreign currency exchange rates had a positive
impact of approximately 5 during calendar 2003 the decrease in revenues was
caused by lower billable headcount and lower utilization workforce reductions
over the past year have resulted in reduced billable headcount in response to
the lower demand in the technology sector billable headcount for our consulting
business as of december 31 2003 has decreased approximately 11 to 410 at
december 31 2003 as compared to 459 at december 31 2002

consulting gross contribution of 868 million for calendar 2003 decreased 16
from 1028 million for calendar 2002 and gross contribution margin for
calendar 2003 decreased to 34 from 37 in the prior year the decrease in the
gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to lower consultant
utilization rates which were approximately 53 during calendar 2003 as compared
to approximately 56 during calendar 2002

as part of our realignment that caused workforce reductions during the fourth
quarter of calendar 2003 we decided to exit certain lines of business and
geographies within our consulting business in order to focus on areas with
potential for higher growth and profitability the realignment is expected to
address the suboptimal utilization rates and our lack of scale in some regions
in the near term this decision will affect overall revenue growth for
consulting as revenues from those areas exited are allowed to wind down while
new areas of focus are beginning to ramp up

consulting backlog decreased 10 to 997 million at december 31 2003 compared
to 1113 million at december 31 2002 but increased sequentially during both
the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2003 when it was 910 million at
june 30 2003 and 928 million at september 30 2003 consulting backlog
decreased as compared to the prior year due to the decline in demand throughout
the entire technology sector as technology customers continued to constrain
spending as noted in the discussion of the research segment the sequential
backlog increases in the latter half of calendar 2003 may be an indication of
increased demand in the technology sector

events
events revenues increased 9 to 1194 million for calendar 2003 compared to
1097 million for calendar 2002 changes in foreign currency exchange rates had
approximately a 5 favorable impact on revenues when comparing calendar 2003 to
calendar 2002 revenues have increased slightly despite having nine fewer events
during calendar 2003 as compared to calendar 2002 the average revenue per event
has increased during calendar 2003 due to the strong performance of our
recurring events as well as the addition of new events during calendar 2003
that had higher revenues than the events that were eliminated

gross contribution of 560 million for calendar 2003 was relatively consistent
with calendar 2002 as a percentage of revenues gross contribution decreased to
47 during calendar 2003 from 51 during calendar 2002 the decrease in gross
contribution margin was due primarily to increased personnel expenses and
increased event marketing costs during 2003 we invested more in marketing and
promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak economy
especially in the technology sector

fiscal year ended september 30 2002 versus fiscal year ended september 30 2001

total revenues decreased 6 to 9072 million in fiscal 2002 compared to 9629
million in fiscal 2001

o    research revenue decreased 7 in fiscal 2002 to 4964 million compared to
     5351 million in fiscal 2001 and comprised approximately 55 and 56 of
     total revenues in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively

o    consulting revenue decreased 1 to 2737 million in fiscal 2002 compared
     to 2763 million in fiscal 2001 and comprised approximately 30 and 29
     of total revenues in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively

o    events revenue was 1220 million in fiscal 2002 a decrease of 8 from the
     1327 million in fiscal 2001 and comprised approximately 13 of total
     revenues in fiscal 2002 versus 14 in fiscal 2001

o    other revenues consisting principally of software licensing and
     maintenance fees decreased 20 to 151 million in fiscal 2002 from 188
     million in fiscal 2001

revenue declined in our three defined geographic market areas united states and
canada emea and other international revenues from sales to united states and
canadian clients decreased 7 to 5953 million in fiscal 2002 from 6419
million in fiscal 2001 revenues from sales to clients in the emea region
decreased 3 to 2421 million in fiscal 2002 from 2500 million in fiscal

million in fiscal 2002 from 711 million in fiscal 2001

cost of services and product development expenses were 4037 million and 4505
million for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 respectively the cost of services and
product development expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 45
from 47 the decrease is attributable to reduced personnel costs associated
with headcount reductions more effective cost management of events and other
cost savings including reduced travel

selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 3454 million in
fiscal 2002 from 3701 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease was due to reduced
payroll associated with lower headcount reduced travel telephone and other
infrastructure costs across the entire company

depreciation expense increased to 425 million in fiscal 2002 from 409
million in fiscal 2001 primarily due to the additional depreciation from
significant capital expenditures made during fiscal 2001 for internal use
software required to support the business and also due to the amortization of
costs associated with the launch of gartnercom in january 2001

amortization of intangibles of 19 million in fiscal 2002 was down from 124
million in fiscal 2001 the primary reason for the decrease was our adoption of
sfas 142 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill for fiscal 2002 for
fiscal 2001 goodwill amortization was 95 million and on an aftertax basis
was 84 million as a result of adoption diluted earnings per share for the
year ended september 30 2002 improved by 009

during fiscal 2002 we recorded other charges of 172 million of these
charges 100 million related to costs and losses associated with our
elimination of excess facilities principally leased facilities and ongoing
lease costs and losses associated with sublease arrangements in addition
approximately 58 million of these charges are associated with a workforce
reduction announced in january 2002 and were for employee termination severance
payments and related benefits this workforce reduction resulted in the
elimination of approximately 100 positions or approximately 2 of our workforce
at the time and the payment of 53 million of termination benefits during
fiscal 2002 the remaining 14 million relates to the impairment of certain
databaserelated assets other charges totaled 466 million for fiscal 2001 of
these charges 248 million was associated with our workforce reduction

announced in april 2001 this workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of
383 positions or approximately 8 of our workforce at the time and the payment
of 64 million and 182 million of termination benefits during fiscal 2002 and
fiscal 2001 respectively the 248 million charge was comprised of employee
termination severance payments and related benefits approximately 143 million
of the other charges were associated with the writedown of goodwill and other
longlived assets to net realizable value as a result of our decision to
discontinue certain unprofitable products and 75 million of the charge was
associated primarily with the writeoff of internally developed systems retired
in connection with the launch of gartnercom at december 31 2003 an
insignificant amount of severance costs remain to be paid during 2004 these
costs will be paid from existing cash the estimated costs associated with the
excess facilities have been reevaluated as part of the charge taken during the
fourth quarter of calendar 2003 discussed previously

operating income increased to 964 million in fiscal 2002 compared to 425
million in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2002 our united states and canadian business
and our european business experienced an increase in operating income of 119
and 113 respectively our other international business experienced an
operating loss for the year which was slightly lower than a year ago on a
consolidated basis operating income as a percentage of total revenues was 11
and 4 respectively for fiscal 2002 and 2001 operating income was impacted
in part by other charges of 172 million and 466 million in fiscal 2002 and
2001 respectively and additional costs associated with the rearchitecture of
our internet capabilities and our research methodology and delivery processes in
fiscal 2001 excluding the other charges operating income for fiscal 2002 and
2001 was 13 and 9 respectively of total revenues we decreased our staff by
approximately 8 in the second half of fiscal 2001 and 2 in midfiscal 2002
and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 decreased the expensetorevenue
ratio associated with our cost of services and selling general and
administrative expenses through various costreduction initiatives the
improvement in operating income was also impacted by lower amortization of
intangibles due to the adoption of sfas 142 amortization of goodwill was 95
million in fiscal 2001

gain loss on investments net for fiscal 2002 included the sale of 748118
shares of cnet for 60 million resulting in a pretax gain of 08 million we
acquired this investment as partial consideration for our sale of techrepublic
to cnet in july 2001 the remaining 24 million loss on investments during
fiscal 2002 was primarily the result of impairment losses related to investments
owned by us through si i si ii and other directly owned investments for other
than temporary declines in value see note 4  investments in the notes to
consolidated financial statements for a further discussion

gain loss on investments net in fiscal 2001 of 275 million included the
sale of shares of an investment in which we held a minority interest for net
cash proceeds of 75 million and a pretax loss of 56 million fiscal 2001
also included a 50 million gain as a result of the sale of shares received
from our venture capital funds si i si ii and other securities for net cash
proceeds of 69 million the remaining loss of 269 million during fiscal 2001
was primarily the result of impairment losses related to investments owned by us
through si i si ii and other directly owned investments for other than
temporary declines in value see note 4  investments in the notes to
consolidated financial statements for a further discussion

interest expense increased to 229 million in fiscal 2002 from 224 million in
fiscal 2001 the increase relates primarily to increased interest expense on the
6 convertible longterm debt compared to fiscal 2001 interest income of 18
million in fiscal 2002 was up from 16 million in fiscal 2001 due to a higher
average balance of funds available for investment offset in part by lower
interest earnings rates other expense net decreased to 02 million in fiscal
2002 from 37 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease related primarily to lower
foreign currency exchange losses of 27 and a 05 million gain from the sale
of a business in fiscal 2002

provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 250 million in fiscal
2002 compared to a benefit of 92 million in fiscal 2001 the effective tax
rate was 34 for fiscal 2002 the effective tax rate in fiscal 2001 less the
impact of a onetime tax benefit of 145 million due to the utilization of
foreign tax credits in the second half of fiscal 2001 and other charges and
losses on investments and related tax impact was 37 the reduction in the
effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 reflects ongoing tax planning and the
elimination of nondeductible amortization of goodwill pursuant to the adoption
of sfas 142 a more detailed analysis of the changes in the provision benefit
for income taxes is provided in note 12income taxes of the notes to

segment analysis

research
research revenues of 4964 million in fiscal 2002 were down 7 from 5351
million in fiscal 2001 the decline in revenues was due to lower demand
throughout the entire technology sector and the overall weakness in the general
economy researchs gross contribution in fiscal 2002 decreased 7 to 3263
million from 3526 million in fiscal 2001 researchs gross contribution margin
was 66 in fiscal 2002 and 2001 although revenues declined gross contribution
margin remained flat in part due to reductions in expenses the decline in
gross contribution was due to lower revenues

our research client retention rate was 75 for fiscal 2002 compared to 74 for
fiscal 2001 total research contract value decreased 11 to approximately 4960
million at september 30 2002 from 5560 million at september 30 2001 the
decrease in contract value reflects a decline in demand throughout the entire
technology sector as well as overall weakness in the general economy

consulting
consulting revenues of 2737 million in fiscal 2002 were down 1 from 2763
million in fiscal 2001 revenues for fiscal 2002 reflect a strategic reduction
in certain client segments and geographies based on market share competitive
advantage client size and other factors the reduction in revenue was partially
offset by increases in average project size and length consultings gross
contribution increased by 13 to 979 million in fiscal 2002 from 869 million
in fiscal 2001 consultings gross contribution margin of 36 in fiscal 2002
increased from 31 in fiscal 2001 primarily due to reduced expenses higher
utilization rates and higher billing rates we reduced headcount and eliminated
expenses in practice areas and markets where we did not have sufficient scale
and volume


consulting backlog decreased 10 to approximately 1076 million at september
30 2002 from 1190 million at september 30 2001 the decrease in backlog
primarily reflects the overall weakness in the general economy

events
events revenues of 1220 million in fiscal 2002 were down 8 from 1327
million in fiscal 2001 the decline was primarily due to fewer events due to
the strategic elimination of less profitable and unproven events with the
expectation of obtaining greater attendee and exhibitor participation at
higherprofit events the overall weakness in the general economy and lower
travel budgets events gross contribution increased by 3 to 654 million in
fiscal 2002 from 636 million in fiscal 2001 with gross contribution margin of
54 in fiscal 2002 compared to 48 in fiscal 2001 the increase in gross
contribution and margin was due to better cost management and the elimination of
less profitable events

liquidity and capital resources

calendar 2003
cash provided by operating activities during calendar 2003 was 1363 million
compared to 1458 million during calendar 2002 the decrease was primarily due
to lower cashrelated earnings and a smaller decrease in receivables during
calendar 2003 compared to calendar 2002 cashrelated earnings are income from
continuing operations adjusted for the noncash items included in income such
as depreciation and amortization the accretion of interest and amortization of
debt issue costs along with other noncash charges partially offsetting these
decreases were higher bonus payments during calendar 2002 bonus payments were
higher during calendar 2002 due to our change in fiscal year from september 30
to december 31 effective january 1 2003 our fiscal 2002 bonuses were paid
during transition 2002 or the fourth quarter of calendar 2002 whereas
calendar 2003 bonuses will be paid during 2004

cash used in investing activities was 254 million for calendar 2003 compared
to 263 million for calendar 2002 the decrease was due primarily to the
proceeds received from an insurance recovery of 55 million during calendar
2003 associated with a previously incurred loss on a claim resulting from the
sale of a business in 2000 additionally during 2002 we spent 39 million to
purchase the remaining 499 of people3 inc not previously owned by us during
calendar 2003 and calendar 2002 we funded 20 million and 15 million
respectively of our investment commitment to si ii reducing our remaining
commitment as of december 31 2003 to 40 million spending on property and
equipment increased 78 million to 289 million during calendar 2003 as
compared to 211 million during the same period of 2002

cash used in financing activities totaled 30 million for calendar 2003
compared to 422 million for calendar 2002 we purchased 434 million of
common stock for treasury during calendar 2003 as compared to 599 million
during calendar 2002 see further discussion below under stock repurchases we
received proceeds of 417 million from the exercise of stock options and the
purchase of stock by employees participating in the employee stock purchase plan
during calendar 2003 as compared to 179 million during the calendar 2002

at december 31 2003 cash and cash equivalents totaled 2300 million the
effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by 124 million
during calendar 2003 and was due to the weakening of the us dollar against
certain foreign currencies

fiscal year 2002
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2002 was 1456 million
compared to 735 million during fiscal 2001 the increase was primarily due to
significantly higher income from continuing operations lower amounts of
termination payments associated with workforce reductions and working capital
management

cash used in investing activities totaled 194 million for fiscal 2002
compared to 446 million used in fiscal 2001 cash used in investing activities
during fiscal 2002 and 2001 included 196 million and 575 million
respectively for additions to property equipment and leasehold improvements
these additions in fiscal 2002 were primarily the result of investments in
infrastructure systems these cash uses in fiscal 2002 were partially offset by
proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 60 million the additions
to property equipment and leasehold improvements in fiscal 2001 were primarily
the result of investments in gartnercom and other infrastructure systems these
cash uses in fiscal 2001 were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of
marketable securities and discontinued operations of 144 million and 105
million respectively cash used for business acquisitions was 45 million and
120 million for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively

cash used in financing activities totaled 401 million in fiscal 2002 compared

2002 resulted primarily from the purchase of 470 million of common stock for
treasury see discussion below under stock repurchases and the repayment of
credit facility loans of 150 million these uses of cash were partially offset
by proceeds of 222 million from the exercise of stock options and the employee
stock purchase plan the cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2001
resulted primarily from the purchase of common stock for treasury of 379
million see discussion below under stock repurchases offset in part by
proceeds of 150 million from credit facility borrowings and by proceeds of
91 million from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase
plan

total cash used by discontinued operations sold in fiscal 2001 was 342
million in fiscal 2001

at september 30 2002 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1248 million the
effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by 17 million for
the year ended september 30 2002 and was due to the weakening of the us
dollar against certain foreign currencies in fiscal 2001 the negative effect
of exchange rates reduced cash and cash equivalents by 04 million

obligations and commitments

we have a 2000 million unsecured senior revolving credit facility led by
jpmorgan chase bank at december 31 2003 there were no amounts outstanding
under the facility we are subject to certain customary affirmative negative
and financial covenants under this credit facility and continued compliance
with these covenants preclude us from borrowing the maximum amount of the credit
facility from time to time these covenants are primarily based on financial
results and other measures such as contract value as a result of these
covenants our borrowing availability at december 31 2003 was 184 million
this credit facility expires in july 2004 we expect to obtain a revolving
credit facility to replace the current facility upon expiration

on april 17 2000 we issued in a private placement transaction 3000 million
of 6 convertible subordinated notes to silver lake partners lp slp and
other noteholders interest accrued semiannually by a corresponding increase in
the face amount of the convertible notes these notes were due and payable on
april 17 2005

in october 2003 our notes were converted into 49441122 shares of gartner
class a common stock the shares owned by slp as a result of this conversion
represent approximately 459 of our outstanding class a common stock and
approximately 361 on a combined basis with our outstanding class b common
stock based upon shares outstanding as of december 31 2003 the conversion was
in accordance with the original terms of the notes

the determination of the number of shares issued upon conversion was based upon
a 745 conversion price and a convertible note of 3683 million consisting of
the original face amount of 300 million plus accrued interest of 683 million
the unamortized balances of debt issue costs of 28 million and debt discount
of 03 million as of the conversion date were netted against the outstanding
principal and interest balances resulting in a 3652 million increase to
stockholders equity additionally certain costs directly associated with the
conversion such as regulatory filings banking and legal fees totaling 06
million were charged to equity

we believe that our current cash balances together with cash anticipated to be
provided by operating activities and borrowings available under the existing
credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable
longterm cash needs in the ordinary course of business if we were to require
substantial amounts of additional capital to pursue business opportunities that
may arise involving substantial investments of additional capital there can be
no assurances that such capital will be available to us or will be available on
commercially reasonable terms

factors that may affect future results
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves
numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in
addition we and our clients are affected by the economy the following section
discusses many but not all of these risks and uncertainties

economic conditions our revenues and results of operations are influenced by
economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in
the it industry a general economic downturn or recession anywhere in the
world could negatively affect demand for our products and services and may
substantially reduce existing and potential client information
technologyrelated budgets the recent economic downturn in the united states
and globally has led to constrained it spending which has impacted our business
and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and
results of operations including the ability to maintain client retention
wallet retention and consulting utilization rates and achieve contract value
and consulting backlog to the extent our clients are in the it industry the
severe decline in that sector has also had a significant impact on it spending

acts of terrorism or war acts of terrorism acts of war and other unforeseen
events may cause damage or disruption to our properties business employees
suppliers distributors and clients which could have an adverse effect on our
business financial condition and operating results such events may also result
in an economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere which could adversely
affect our business financial condition and operating results

competitive environment we face direct competition from a significant number of
independent providers of information products and services including
information that can be found on the internet free of charge we also compete
indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including
electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial
information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect
competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition
limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business as a
result additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start
to provide additional or complementary services additionally technological
advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources however
we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus
our competition increased competition may result in loss of market share
diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing and increased
marketing expenditures we may not be successful if we cannot compete
effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information

renewal of research business by existing clients some of our success depends on
renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services which
constituted 54 of our revenues for calendar 2003 these research subscription
agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months our
ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including
those described in this annual report additionally as we implement our
strategy to realign our business to client needs we may shift the type and

                                                                         10k23

pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates while client
retention rates were 78 at december 31 2003 and 74 at december 31 2002
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to have this level of client
renewals any material decline in renewal rates could have an adverse impact on
our revenues and our financial condition

nonrecurring consulting engagements consulting segment revenues constituted
30 of our revenues for calendar 2003 these consulting engagements typically
are projectbased and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting
engagements is subject to numerous factors including those described in this
annual report any material decline in our ability to replace consulting
arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial
condition

restructuring reorganization and management team our future success depends
in significant part upon the continued service and performance of our senior
management and other key personnel we have recently reorganized our business
around specific client needs as part of this reorganization a number of key
management positions have been filled by the promotion of current employees or
the hiring of new employees as part of this reorganization we have
restructured our workforce in order to streamline operations and strengthen key
consulting practices if the reorganization and restructuring of our business do
not lead to the results we expect our ability to effectively deliver our
products manage our company and carry out our business plan may be impaired

hiring and retention of employees our success depends heavily upon the quality
of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key
personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified
professionals from among others technology companies market research firms
consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media
companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these
professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to
noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any
failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel
as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business
could adversely affect the quality of our products and services and therefore
our future business and operating results

maintenance of existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving
market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and
timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide
credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a
material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if
our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate
research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may
decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our
products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and
improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future
business and operating results

introduction of new products and services the market for our products and
services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and
analysis to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and
improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services
in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and
services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any
failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services
could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or
financial position

international operations a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from
sales outside of north america 38 for calendar 2003 as a result our
operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business
activities including general political and economic conditions in each country
changes in market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations and tariffs
and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign
operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign
laws and regulations different or overlapping tax structures higher levels of
united states taxation on foreign income and the difficulty of enforcing client
agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property
rights in international jurisdictions we rely on local distributors or sales
agents in some international locations if any of

these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to
replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of
the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business
with us or our new agent

branding we believe that our gartner brand is critical to our efforts to
attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will
increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to
promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing
budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend
additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to
create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and
maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future
business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted

indebtedness we have a 2000 million senior revolving credit facility under
which we can incur significant additional indebtedness although there were no
amounts outstanding at december 31 2003 the affirmative negative and
financial covenants of this debt facility could limit our future financial
flexibility as a result of these covenants our borrowing availability at
december 31 2003 was 1840 million the associated debt service costs could
impair future operating results any outstanding debt may limit the amount of
cash or additional credit available to us which could restrain our ability to
expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive pressures or
pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of
additional capital

organizational and product integration related to acquisitions we have made and
may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses
that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each
acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value
we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current
stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the
assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the
ability to integrate successfully the operations and personnel of the acquired
business the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the time
to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired
company the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of
management from our business the realization of any of these risks could
adversely affect our business

enforcement of our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of
copyright patent trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and
other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized
third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard
as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal
challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws
of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as
the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our
intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which
could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to
noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former
employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete
against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period there is no
assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the noncompete
provision

possibility of infringement claims third parties may assert infringement claims
against us regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time
consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and
licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a
substitute technology our business results of operations or financial position
could be materially adversely affected

potential fluctuations in operating results our quarterly and annual operating
income may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the
timing of the execution of research contracts which typically occurs in the
fourth calendar quarter the extent of completion of consulting engagements the
timing of symposia and other events which also occur to a greater extent in the
fourth calendar quarter the amount of new business generated the mix of
domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products
and services the

timing of the development introduction and marketing of new products and
services and competition in the industry an inability to generate sufficient
earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our operating and
other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause
periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may
provide an unreliable indication of future operating results

significant stockholder silver lake partners lp slp and its affiliates
own approximately 459 of our outstanding class a common stock and
approximately 361 on a combined basis with our outstanding class b common

are only entitled to vote for two of the ten members of our board of directors
and vote together with the holders of the class b common stock as a single class
on all other matters coming before the stockholders slp is restricted from
purchasing additional stock without our consent pursuant to the terms of a
securityholders agreement this securityholders agreement also provides that
we cannot take certain actions including acquisitions and sales of stock andor
assets without slps consent while slp does not hold a majority of our
outstanding shares it may be able to exercise significant influence over
matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and
the approval of mergers consolidations and sales of our assets slps interests
may differ from the interests of other stockholders

antitakeover protections provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control
of us in a transaction not approved by the requisite number of directors these
provisions include

o    the presence of a classified board of directors

o    the existence of two classes of common stock with our class b common stock
     having the ability to elect 80 of our board of directors

o    the ability of the board of directors to issue and determine the terms of
     preferred stock

o    advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at
     stockholder meetings and

o    the antitakeover provisions of delaware law

these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control or change in
management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of
their common stock

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk
as of december 31 2003 we have limited exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates since our longterm debt was converted to equity during the
fourth quarter of calendar 2003 additionally we have no borrowings under our
2000 million unsecured senior revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase
bank under the revolving credit facility the interest rate on borrowings is
libor plus an additional 100 to 200 basis points based on our debttoebitda
ratio we believe that an increase or decrease of 10 in the effective interest
rate on available borrowings from our senior revolving credit facility if fully
utilized would not have a material effect on our future results of operations
each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an
approximate 05 million annual effect under the revolving credit facility if
fully utilized

investment risk
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of
our equity investments we invest in equity securities of public and private
companies directly and through si i a whollyowned affiliate and si ii of
which we own 34 si i and si ii are engaged in making venture capital
investments in early to midstage itbased or internetenabled companies see
note 4  investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as
of december 31 2003 we had investments in equity securities totaling 109
million unrealized gains and losses were insignificant these investments are
inherently risky as the businesses are typically in early development stages and
may never develop further certain of these investments are in publicly traded
companies whose shares are subject to significant market price volatility
adverse changes in market conditions and poor operating results of the
underlying investments may result in us incurring additional losses or an
inability to recover the original carrying value of our investments if there
were a 100 adverse change in the value of our equity portfolio as of december
31 2003 this would result in a noncash impairment charge of 109 million
additionally we have a commitment to fund an additional 40 million of
investments with si ii

foreign currency exchange risk
we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and
transaction risk amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into
us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date the
resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity deficit section
of the consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect
revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar
since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally
denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries the foreign currency
translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity and
do not impact operating results revenues and expenses in foreign currencies
translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us
dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies therefore changes in
exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as
expressed in us dollars from foreign operations currency transaction gains
or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional
currency are included within other income expense net within the consolidated
statements of operations currency transaction gains losses net were 05
million during calendar 2003 04 million during calendar 2002 01
million during transition 2002 08 million during fiscal 2002 and 35
million during fiscal 2001

from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or
other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2003 we had
one foreign currency forward contract outstanding foreign exchange forward
contracts are reflected at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently
in earnings

the following table presents information about our foreign currency forward
contract outstanding as of december 31 2003 expressed in us dollar

                   notes to consolidated financial statements

1summary of significant accounting policies
basis of presentation on october 30 2002 we announced that the board of
directors approved a change of our fiscal year end from september 30 to december
31 effective january 1 2003 this change resulted in a threemonth
transitional period ending december 31 2002 references to transition 2002
unless otherwise indicated refer to the threemonth transitional period ended
december 31 2002 references to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 unless otherwise
indicated are to the respective fiscal year period from october 1 through
september 30 references to calendar 2003 and calendar 2002 unless otherwise
indicated are to the respective twelvemonth period from january 1 through
december 31 the unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended
december 31 2002 is presented for comparative purposes certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation when
used in these notes the terms company we us or our mean gartner
inc and its subsidiaries

principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the company and its majorityowned subsidiaries all significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated investments in
companies in which we own less than 50 but have the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for
using the equity method all other investments for which we do not have the
ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost
method of accounting the results of operations for acquisitions of companies
accounted for using the purchase method have been included in the consolidated
statements of operations beginning on the closing date of acquisition

revenues and commission expense recognition we typically enter into annually
renewable subscription contracts for research products revenues from research
products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract terms
the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing absent special
terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all research contracts are
noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts that have a
30day cancellation clause but have not produced material cancellations to date
with the exception of certain government contracts which permit termination and
contracts with special billing terms it is our policy to record the entire
amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the
contract is signed which represents a legally enforceable claim and a
corresponding amount as deferred revenue for those government contracts that
permit termination we bill the client the full amount billable under the
contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the
contract in addition we only record deferred revenue on these government
contracts when cash is received deferred revenue attributable to government
contracts was 386 million 293 million and 289 million at december 31
2003 december 31 2002 and september 30 2002 respectively in addition at
december 31 2003 december 31 2002 and september 30 2002 we had not
recognized receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts
that permit termination of 66 million 47 million and 77 million
respectively which had been billed but not yet collected we record the
commission obligation related to research contracts upon the signing of the
contract and amortize the corresponding deferred commission expense over the
contract period in which the related revenues are earned

consulting revenues primarily derived from consulting measurement and
strategic advisory services paid oneday analyst engagements are based
primarily on fixed fees or time and materials for discrete projects such
revenues are recognized as work is delivered and as services are provided and
are evaluated on a contract by contract basis unbilled fees receivables
associated with consulting engagements were 243 million at december 31 2003
335 million at december 31 2002 and 322 million at september 30 2002

events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related
symposium conference or exhibition in addition we defer certain costs
directly related to events and expense these costs in the period during which
the related symposium conference or exhibition occurs our policy is to defer
only those costs primarily prepaid site and production services costs which
are incremental and are directly attributable to a specific event other costs
of organizing and producing our events primarily company personnel and
nonevent specific expenses are expensed in the period incurred at the end of
each fiscal quarter we assess on an eventbyevent basis whether expected
direct costs of producing a scheduled event will exceed expected revenues if
such costs are expected to exceed revenues we record the expected loss in the
period determined

                                                                         10k39

other revenues includes software licensing fees which are recognized when a
signed noncancelable software license exists delivery has occurred collection
is probable and our fees are fixed or determinable revenues from software
maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of each maintenance
agreement which is typically twelve months

cash and cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents the
carrying value of these investments approximates fair value based upon their
shortterm maturity investments with maturities of more than three months are
classified as marketable securities

investments in equity securities we account for our investments in publicly
traded equity securities under statement of financial accounting standards
sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity
securities these investments meet the criteria for classification as available
for sale given our ability and intent to sell such investments and are
recorded at fair value and included in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheets unrealized gains and losses on these marketable investments are
recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
loss net within the stockholders equity deficit section of the
consolidated balance sheets realized gains and losses are recorded in gain
loss on investments net within the consolidated statements of operations the
cost of equity securities sold is based on specific identification we assess
the need to record impairment losses on investments and record such losses when
the impairment of an investment is determined to be other than temporary in
nature in making this assessment we consider the significance and duration of
the decline in value and the valuation of comparable companies operating in the
internet and technology sectors the impairment factors we evaluate may change
in subsequent periods since the entities underlying these investments operate
in a volatile business environment in addition these entities may require
additional financing to meet their cash and operational needs however there
can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the extent needed at
terms acceptable to the entities if at all these impairment losses are
reflected in gain loss on investments net within the consolidated statements
of operations

we account for investments that we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence over using the cost method of accounting accordingly
these investments are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value and
are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets see note 4 
investments the equity method is used to account for investments in entities
that are not majorityowned and that we do not control but over which we have
the ability to exercise significant influence

property equipment and leasehold improvements property equipment and
leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization property and equipment are depreciated using the straightline
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the related leases
property equipment and leasehold improvements less accumulated depreciation
and amortization consist of the following in thousands

software development costs we capitalize certain computer software development
costs and enhancements for software sold to customers after the establishment
of technological feasibility limited to the net realizable value of the
software product and cease capitalization when the software product is
available for general release to clients until these products reach
technological feasibility all costs related to development efforts are charged
to expense once technological feasibility has been determined additional costs
incurred in development including coding testing and documentation are
capitalized amortization of software development costs is provided on a
productbyproduct basis over the estimated economic life of the software
generally two years using the straightline method and is recorded within
depreciation amortization of capitalized computer software development costs
begins when the products are available for general release to customers
periodic reviews are performed to ensure that unamortized capitalized software
development costs remain recoverable from future revenue capitalized software

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired
businesses over the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable
intangible net assets acquired effective october 1 2001 the company adopted
sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets the adoption of sfas no
142 eliminated goodwill amortization instead goodwill is tested for impairment
at the reporting unit level at least annually a reporting unit can be an
operating segment or a business if discrete financial information is prepared
and reviewed by management under the impairment test if a reporting units
carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value goodwill impairment is
recognized to the extent that the reporting units carrying amount of goodwill
exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill the fair value of reporting
units were estimated using discounted cash flows market multiples and other
valuation techniques

impairment of longlived assets and intangible assets we review longlived
assets and intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the respective
asset may not be recoverable such evaluation may be based on a number of
factors including current and projected operating results and cash flows
changes in managements strategic direction as well as other economic and market
variables our policy regarding longlived assets and intangible assets other
than goodwill is to evaluate the recoverability of these assets by determining
whether the balance can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash
flows should events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not
be recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flows an impairment
loss would be recognized the amount of impairment if any is measured based on
the difference between projected discounted future operating cash flows using a
discount rate reflecting our average cost of funds and the carrying value of the
asset see note 5  other charges

foreign currency translation all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance
sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as foreign
currency translation adjustments a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income loss net within the stockholders equity deficit section of the
consolidated balance sheets income and expense items are translated at average
exchange rates for the year currency transaction gains or losses arising from
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a
subsidiary are included in results of operations within other income expense
net within the consolidated statements of operations currency transaction gains
losses net were 05 million during calendar 2003 04 million unaudited
during calendar 2002 01 million during transition 2002 08 million
during fiscal 2002 and 35 million during fiscal 2001

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on
differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using
presently enacted tax rates the provision for income taxes is the sum of the
amount of income tax paid or payable for the year as determined by applying the
provisions of enacted tax laws to taxable income for that year and the net
changes during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities undistributed
earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us amounted to approximately 80
million as of december 31 2003 and will be indefinitely reinvested
accordingly no material provision has been made for taxes that may be payable
upon remittance of such earnings nor is it practicable to determine the amount
of any

liability we credit additional paidin capital for realized tax benefits
arising from stock transactions with employees the tax benefit on a
nonqualified stock option is equal to the tax effect of the difference between
the market price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise
price

fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments include cash and
cash equivalents fees receivable accounts payable and accruals which are
shortterm in nature the carrying amounts of these financial instruments
approximate their fair value investments in publicly traded equity securities
are valued based on quoted market prices investments in equity securities that
are not publicly traded are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value
which approximates fair market value

although there were no amounts outstanding at december 31 2003 under a senior
revolving credit facility the carrying amount of any such borrowings would
approximate fair value as the rates of interest on the revolving credit facility
approximate current market rates of interest for similar instruments with
comparable maturities

concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us
to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents
marketable equity securities and fees receivable concentrations of credit risk
with respect to fees receivable are limited due to the large number of clients
comprising the client base and their dispersion across many different industries
and geographic regions

use of estimates we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets liabilities and disclosures if any of contingent assets and
liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods such estimates are required
by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america in
our preparation of the consolidated financial statements actual results could
differ from those estimates estimates are used when accounting for such items
as allowance for doubtful accounts investments depreciation amortization
income taxes and certain accrued liabilities

accounting for stockbased compensation we have several stockbased
compensation plans we apply accounting principles board opinion no 25
accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 in accounting for our
employee stock options and purchase rights and apply statement of financial
accounting standards no 123 accounting for stock issued to employees sfas
123 for disclosure purposes only under apb 25 the intrinsic value method is
used to account for stockbased employee compensation plans the sfas 123
disclosures include pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the fair

recently issued accounting standards in january 2003 the financial accounting
standards board fasb issued financial interpretation fin no 46
consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 51 fin
no 46 provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is
achieved through means other than through voting rights called variable
interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business
enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary this new
model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either 1 the equity
investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or 2 the
equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities
without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties
in addition fin no 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other
enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional
disclosures we do not have any interests that would change its current
reporting entity or require additional disclosure outlined in fin no 46

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 amendment of statement 133 on

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 150

instruments be classified as liabilities in balance sheets the guidance in sfas
150 is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or
modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective on july 1 2003 the
adoption of sfas 150 had no impact on our financial position cash flows or
results of operations

during calendar 2003 we recorded an impairment loss of 09 million on a
minorityowned investment that is not publicly traded we evaluated the
investment for impairment because of the investees recapitalization due to its
lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity as a
result of this the holders of the mandatorily redeemable shares have agreed to
a recapitalization of the entity at december 31 2003 we wrote our investment
down to our estimate of fair value the estimate of fair value was based upon a
combination of valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis of
future projections of operating performance market comparables and other
available information

during transition 2002 we recognized impairment losses of 17 million
associated with our investment in si venture associates llc si i and si
venture fund ii lp si ii collectively si investments described below

of 69 million for a pretax gain of 50 million during fiscal 2001 we
recognized impairment losses of 265 million associated with our si
investments

affiliate we also own 34 of si ii both entities are venture capital funds
engaged in making investments in early to midstage itbased or internetenabled
companies both entities are managed by si services company llc an entity
controlled by our former chairman of the board who continues as an employee and
chairman emeritus of the company and certain of our former officers and
employees management fees incurred for si services company llc are
approximately 12 million per year in addition we provide access to research
and the use of certain office space at no cost to si services company llc we
had a total original investment commitment to si i and si ii of 100 million
and 300 million respectively the commitment to si i was fully funded in
prior years we made contributions to the si investments of 20 million and
15 million during calendar 2003 and fiscal 2002 respectively we made no
contributions during transition 2002 or fiscal 2001 of the 300 million
commitment to si ii 40 million remained unfunded at december 31 2003 and may
be called by si at any time the carrying value of our investments held by si i
and si ii was 19 million and 48 million respectively at december 31 2003

our share of equity gains in si i and si ii was 01 million for calendar 2003
001 million for transition 2002 and 02 million for fiscal 2002 for fiscal
2001 our share of equity losses in si i and si ii was 03 million during
transition 2002 we recognized impairment losses of 17 million these
impairment losses related to equity securities owned through si i and si ii for
other than temporary declines in the value of certain investments are reflected
in gain loss on investments net in the consolidated statements of operations
during fiscal 2002 we recognized impairment losses of 25 million in
connection with our decision to actively pursue the sale of the investments held
in the si funds during fiscal 2001 we made an assessment of the carrying value
of our investments and determined that the carrying value of certain investments
were in excess of their fair value based on valuations of comparable companies
operating in the internet and technology sectors as a result of these
valuations and due to the significance and duration of the decline in value we
recognized impairment losses of 265 million during fiscal 2001 the impairment
factors we evaluated may change in subsequent periods since the entities
underlying these investments operate in a volatile business environment in
addition these entities may require additional financing to meet their cash and
operational needs however there can be no assurance that such funds will be
available to the extent needed at terms acceptable to the entities if at all
this could result in additional material noncash impairment charges in the
future

we maintain an unsecured credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank as
administrative agent for the participating financial institutions thereunder
providing for a maximum of 200 million of borrowings under a senior revolving
credit facility the revolving credit facility expires on july 16 2004 with
any borrowings under such facility maturing on that date subject to certain
customary conditions on the date of any such loan we had no amounts outstanding

of 030 to 050 on the unused revolving credit amount pursuant to certain
financial covenants of the revolving credit facility we had 184 million of
available borrowings at december 31 2003 these covenants are primarily based
on financial results and other measures such as contract value during fiscal
2002 the weighted average interest rate on borrowings which were only
outstanding during october and november of 2001 was 36

on april 17 2000 we issued in a private placement transaction 3000 million
of 6 convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes to silver lake

scheduled to mature in april 2005 and had been accruing interest at 6 per
annum interest had accrued semiannually by a corresponding increase in the
face amount of the convertible notes commencing september 15 2000

in october 2003 the notes were converted into 49441122 shares of gartner
class a common stock in accordance with the original terms of the notes the
determination of the number of shares issued upon conversion was based upon a
745 conversion price and a convertible note of 3683 million consisting of
the original face amount of 300 million plus accrued interest of 683 million
the unamortized balances of debt issue costs of 28 million and debt discount
of 03 million as of the conversion date were netted against the outstanding
principal and interest balances resulting in a 3652 million increase to
stockholders equity additionally certain costs directly associated with the
conversion such as regulatory filing banking and legal fees totaling 06
million were charged to equity

as printing copying shipping and mail services which expire at various dates
in 2005 and 2006 the minimum obligation under these agreements is approximately

we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary
course of business we believe the outcome of all current proceedings claims
and litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations when resolved in a future period

we have various agreements that may obligate us to indemnify the other party
with respect to certain matters generally these indemnification clauses are
included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we
customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a
breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and
licensed or certain intellectual property rights it is not possible to predict
the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification
agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts
of each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these
agreements have not been material as of december 31 2003 we were not aware of
any indemnification agreements that would require material payments

11computation of earnings loss per share from continuing operations
basic earnings per share eps is computed by dividing income loss from
continuing operations by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period diluted eps reflects the potential dilution of
securities that could share in earnings when the exercise of stock options or
conversion of convertible debt is antidilutive they are excluded from the
calculation

the following table sets forth the reconciliation of the basic and diluted
earnings per share computations in thousands except per share

14segment information

we manage our business in three reportable segments research consulting and
events research consists primarily of subscriptionbased research products
consulting consists primarily of consulting measurement engagements and
strategic advisory services events consists of various symposia conferences
and exhibitions

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross
contribution margin gross contribution as presented below is defined as
operating income excluding certain selling general and administrative expenses
depreciation amortization of intangibles and other charges the accounting
policies used by the reportable segments are the same as those used by the
company

we earn revenue from clients in many countries other than the united states
there is no individual country in which revenues from external clients represent
10 or more of our consolidated revenues additionally no single client
accounted for 10 or more of total revenue and the loss of a single client in
managements opinion would not have a material adverse effect on revenues

we do not identify or allocate assets including capital expenditures by
operating segment accordingly assets are not being reported by segment because
the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the
evaluation of performance or making decisions in the allocation of resources

the following tables present information about reportable segments in
thousands the other column includes certain revenues and corporate and other
expenses primarily selling general and administrative unallocated to
reportable segments expenses allocated to operations that do not meet the
segment reporting quantitative threshold and other charges there are no
intersegment revenues

our consolidated revenues are generated primarily through direct sales to
clients by domestic and international sales forces and a network of independent
international sales agents we define other international revenues as revenues
attributable to all areas located outside of the united states canada and
europe most of our products and services are provided on an integrated
worldwide basis because of the integration of products and services delivery
it is not practical to separate precisely our revenues by geographic location
longlived assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets accordingly the
separation set forth in the table below is based upon internal allocations
which involve certain management estimates and judgments

we believe that the principal competitive factors that differentiate us from our

firms and other information providers including electronic and print media
companies these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us
in the future limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do

start to provide additional or complementary services increased competition may
result in us losing market share diminished value in our products and services
reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures

                                        conference or exhibition





fluctuations in quarterly operating results

our quarterly and annual revenue and operating income fluctuate as a result of
many factors including the timing of the execution of research contracts the
extent of completion of consulting engagements the timing of symposia and other
events which occur to a greater extent in the quarter ended december 31 the
amount of new business generated the mix of domestic and international
business changes in market demand for our products and services the timing of
the development introduction and marketing of new products and services and
competition in the industry the potential fluctuations in our operating income
could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be
meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating
results

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate
accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1
in the notes to consolidated financial statements management considers the
policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial
statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgements
and estimates specific risks for these critical accounting policies are
described below

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff
accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in





                                       8
page

financial statements sab 101 revenue by significant source is accounted for
as follows

     o    revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably
          over the applicable contract term

     o    consulting revenues are recognized primarily on a percentage of
          completion basis and on a time and materials basis as work is
          performed and services are provided on a contractbycontract basis

     o    events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the
          related symposium conference or exhibition and

     o    other revenues principally software licensing fees are recognized
          when a signed noncancelable software license exists delivery has
          occurred collection is probable and the fees are fixed or
          determinable

uncollectible accounts receivable  provisions for bad debts are recognized as
incurred the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for
uncollectible accounts receivable is based on historical loss experience aging
of outstanding receivables an assessment of current economic conditions and the
financial health of specific clients this evaluation is inherently judgmental
and requires material estimates these valuation reserves are periodically
reevaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility
of accounts receivable becomes available circumstances that could cause our
valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and
credit quality other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay
their obligations as they come due and the quality of our collection efforts
total trade receivables at september 30 2002 were 2718 million against which
an allowance for losses of approximately 70 million was provided total trade
receivables at september 30 2001 were 3059 million against which an
allowance for losses of approximately 56 million was provided

impairment of investment securities  a charge to earnings is made when a market
decline below cost is other than temporary management regularly reviews each
investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the length of
time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost the financial
condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer the valuation of comparable
companies and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value total
investments in equity securities was 127 million and 185 million at
september 30 2002 and 2001 respectively see note 5  investments in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  the evaluation of goodwill
is performed in accordance with sfas no 142  goodwill and other intangible
assets among other requirements this standard eliminated goodwill
amortization upon adoption and required an initial assessment for goodwill
impairment within six months of adoption and at least annually thereafter the
evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and
losses are recorded when the assets carrying value is not recoverable through
future cash flows these assessments require management to estimate future
business operations and market and economic conditions in developing longterm
forecasts goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger a review for
impairment include the following

     o    significant underperformance relative to historical or projected
          future operating results

     o    significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the
          strategy for our overall business

     o    significant negative industry or economic trends

     o    significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and

     o    our market capitalization relative to net book value

accounting for income taxes  as we prepare our consolidated financial
statements we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we
operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with
assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for
tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and
liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we assess
the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future
taxable income and we establish a valuation allowance to the extent we believe
that recovery is not likely

contingencies and other loss reserves  we establish reserves for severance
costs contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we
undertake to streamline our organization reposition certain businesses and
reduce ongoing costs estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these
actions such as future lease payments sublease income the fair value of
assets and severance and related benefits are based on assumptions at the time
the actions are initiated to the extent actual costs differ from those
estimates reserve levels may need to be adjusted in addition these actions
may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at
the time such plans were approved

results of operations

fiscal year ended september 30 2002 versus fiscal year ended september 30 2001

total revenues decreased 6 to 9072 million in fiscal 2002 compared to 9629
million in fiscal 2001 the fiscal 2001 revenues and cost of services for the
consulting segment have been reclassified to include reimbursable outofpocket
expenses in accordance with new accounting requirements adopted in 2002

o    research revenue decreased 7 in fiscal 2002 to 4964 million compared to
     5351 million in fiscal 2001 and comprised approximately 55 and 56 of
     total revenues in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively

o    consulting revenue decreased 1 to 2737 million in fiscal 2002 compared
     to 2763 million in fiscal 2001 and comprised approximately 30 and 29
     of total revenues in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively

o    events revenue was 1220 million in fiscal 2002 a decrease of 8 from the
     1327 million in fiscal 2001 and comprised approximately 13 of total
     revenues in fiscal 2002 versus 14 in fiscal 2001

o    other revenues consisting principally of software licensing and
     maintenance fees decreased 20 to 151 million in fiscal 2002 from 188
     million in fiscal 2001

revenue has declined in our three defined geographic market areas united states
and canada europe and other international revenues from sales to united
states and canadian clients decreased 7 to 5953 million in fiscal 2002 from
6419 million in fiscal 2001 revenues from sales to european clients decreased
3 to 2421 million in fiscal 2002 from 2500 million in fiscal 2001 revenues
from sales to other international clients decreased 2 to 697 million in
fiscal 2002 from 711 million in fiscal 2001

cost of services and product development expenses were 4037 million and 4505
million for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 respectively the cost of services and
product development expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 45
from 47 the decrease is attributable to reduced personnel costs associated
with headcount reductions more effective cost management of events and other
cost savings including reduced travel

selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 3454 million in
fiscal 2002 from 3701 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease was due to reduced
payroll associated with lower headcount reduced travel telephone and other
infrastructure costs across the entire company

depreciation expense increased to 425 million in fiscal 2002 from 409
million in fiscal 2001 primarily due to the depreciation of significant capital
expenditures in the previous year for internal use software development required
to support the business and also due to the amortization of costs associated
with the launch of gartnercom in january 2001

amortization of intangibles of 19 million in fiscal 2002 was down from 124
million in fiscal 2001 the primary reason for the decrease was the early
adoption of sfas no 142 for the year ended september 30 2001 goodwill
amortization was 95 million and on an aftertax basis was 84 million as a
result of adoption diluted earnings per share for the year ended september 30
2002 improved by 009

during fiscal 2002 we recorded other charges of 172 million of these
charges 100 million relates to costs and losses associated with our
elimination of excess facilities principally leased facilities and ongoing
lease costs and losses associated with sublease arrangements in addition
approximately 58 million of these charges are associated with a workforce
reduction announced in january 2002 and are for employee termination severance
payments and related benefits this workforce reduction resulted in the
elimination of approximately 100 positions or approximately 2 of our workforce
at the time and the payment of 53 million of termination benefits during the
fiscal year ended september 30 2002 the remaining 14 million relates to the
impairment of certain databaserelated assets other charges totaled 466
million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2001 of these charges 248
million was associated with our workforce reduction announced in april 2001
this workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of 383 positions or
approximately 8 of our workforce at the time and the payment of 64 million
and 182 million of termination benefits during the fiscal years ended
september 30 2002 and 2001 respectively the 248 million charge is comprised
of employee termination severance payments and related benefits approximately
143 million of the other charges are associated with the writedown of
goodwill and other longlived assets to net realizable value as a result of our
decision to discontinue certain unprofitable products and 75 million of the
charge is associated primarily with the writeoff of internally developed
systems retired in connection with the launch of gartnercom and seatbased
pricing at september 30 2002 47 million remains to be paid relating to the
other charges recorded in both 2001 and 2002 the payments are expected to be
made primarily over the next two to three years we are funding all of these
costs out of operating cash flows

operating income increased to 964 million in fiscal 2002 compared to 425
million in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2002 our united states canadian and european
businesses experienced an increase in operating income of 119 and 113
respectively our other international business experienced an operating loss for
the year which was slightly lower than a year ago on a consolidated basis
operating income as a percentage of total revenues was 11 and 4 respectively
for fiscal 2002 and 2001 operating income was impacted in part by other
charges of 172 million and 466 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001
respectively and additional costs associated with the rearchitecture of our
internet capabilities and our research methodology and delivery processes in
fiscal 2001 excluding the other charges operating income for fiscal 2002 and
2001 was 13 and 9 respectively of total revenues we decreased our staff by
approximately 8 in the second half of fiscal 2001 and 2 in midfiscal 2002
and in the fourth quarter of 2001 decreased the expensetorevenue ratio
associated with our cost of services and selling general and administrative
expenses through various costreduction initiatives the improvement in
operating income was also impacted by lower amortization of intangibles due to
the adoption of sfas no 142 amortization of goodwill was 95 million in
fiscal 2001

net gain loss from the sale of investments for the year ended september 30
2002 reflected the sale of 748118 shares of cnet networks inc cnet for
60 million resulting in a pretax gain of 08 million we acquired this
investment as partial consideration for our sale of techrepublic to cnet in july
2001 net loss on the sale of investments in fiscal 2001 of 06 million
includes the sale of our remaining 1922795 shares of jupiter media metrix
jupiter for net cash proceeds of 75 million for a pretax loss of 56
million offset in part by the sale of shares received from our venture capital
funds si venture associates si i si venture fund ii si ii and other
securities for net cash proceeds of 69 million for a pretax gain of 50
million

net loss from minorityowned investments in fiscal 2002 and 2001 of 24 million
and 268 million respectively were primarily the result of impairment losses
related to investments owned by us through si i si ii and other directly owned
investments for other than temporary declines in value these investments are
comprised of early to midstage itbased or internetenabled companies we made
an assessment of the carrying value of our investments and determined that
certain investments were in excess of their fair value due to the significance
and duration of the decline in valuation of comparable companies operating in
the internet and technology sectors see note 5  investments in the notes to
consolidated financial statements the impairment factors evaluated by
management may change in subsequent periods given that the entities underlying
these investments operate in a volatile business environment in addition these
entities may require additional financing to meet their cash and operational
needs however there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to
the extent needed at terms acceptable to the entities if at all this could
result in additional material noncash impairment charges in the future we
intend to sell all of our investments owned through si i and si ii

interest expense increased to 229 million in fiscal 2002 from 224 million in
fiscal 2001 the increase relates primarily to increased interest expense on the
6 convertible longterm debt compared to fiscal 2001 interest income of 18
million in fiscal 2002 was up from 16 million in fiscal 2001 due to a higher
average balance of funds available for investment offset in part by lower
interest earnings rates other expense net decreased to 02 million in fiscal
2002 from 37 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease relates primarily to lower
foreign currency exchange losses of 27 and a 05 million gain from the sale
of a business in the second quarter of fiscal 2002

provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 250 million in fiscal
2002 compared to a benefit of 92 million in fiscal 2001 the effective tax
rate was 34 for the year ended september 30 2002 the effective tax rate in
2001 less the impact of a onetime tax benefit of 145 million due to the
utilization of foreign tax credits in the second half of 2001 and other charges
and losses on investments and related tax impact was 37 the reduction in the
effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 reflects ongoing tax planning and the
elimination of nondeductible amortization of goodwill pursuant to the adoption
of sfas no 142 a more detailed analysis of the changes in the provision
benefit for income taxes is provided in note 14  income taxes of the notes to
consolidated financial statements

basic income loss per share from continuing operations was 058 per share in
fiscal 2002 compared to 000 per share in fiscal 2001 diluted income loss
per share from continuing operations of 047 per share in fiscal 2002 compared
to 000 per share in fiscal 2001 the elimination of goodwill amortization in
accordance with sfas no 142 improved basic and diluted income per share from
continuing operations by 010 and 009 respectively for fiscal 2002 as
compared to fiscal 2001

segment analysis

we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross
contribution margin gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding
certain selling general and administrative expenses depreciation amortization
of intangibles and other charges

research

research revenues of 4964 million in fiscal 2002 were down 7 from 5351
million in 2001 the decline in revenues was due to lower demand throughout the
entire technology sector and the overall weakness in the general economy
researchs gross contribution in fiscal 2002 decreased 7 to 3263 million from
3526 million in fiscal 2001 researchs gross contribution margin was 66 in
fiscal 2002 and 2001 although revenues declined gross contribution margin
remained flat in part due to reductions in expenses the decline in gross
contribution was due to lower revenues for 2003 our focus will be on
stabilizing then growing contract value while maintaining a streamlined cost
structure our strategy is to expand our research business with larger clients

our research client retention rate was 75 for fiscal 2002 compared to 74 for
fiscal 2001 total research contract value decreased 11 to approximately 4960
million at september 30 2002 from 5560 million at september 30 2001 the
decrease in contract value reflects a decline in demand throughout the entire
technology sector as well as overall weakness in the general economy

consulting

consulting revenues of 2737 million in fiscal 2002 were down 1 from 2763
million in 2001 revenues for fiscal 2002 reflect a strategic reduction in
certain client segments and geographies based on market share competitive
advantage client size and other factors the reduction in revenue was partially
offset by increases in average project size and length consultings gross
contribution increased by 13 to 979 million in fiscal 2002 from 869 million
in fiscal 2001 consultings gross contribution margin of 36 in fiscal 2002
increased from 31 in fiscal 2001 primarily due to reduced expenses higher
utilization rates and higher billing rates we continue to

focus on larger engagements and on a limited set of practices and markets in
which we can achieve significant penetration we have reduced headcount and
eliminated expenses in practice areas and markets where we do not have
sufficient scale and volume

consulting backlog decreased 10 to approximately 1076 million at september
30 2002 from 1190 million at september 30 2001 the decrease in backlog
primarily reflects the overall weakness in the general economy

events

events revenues of 1220 million in fiscal 2002 were down 8 from 1327
million in 2001 the decline was primarily due to 1 fewer events due to the
strategic elimination of less profitable and unproven events with the
expectation of obtaining greater attendee and exhibitor participation at
higherprofit events 2 the overall weakness in the general economy and 3
lower travel budgets events gross contribution increased by 3 to 654
million in fiscal 2002 from 636 million in fiscal 2001 with gross contribution
margin of 54 in 2002 compared to 48 in fiscal 2001 the increase in gross
contribution and margin was due to better cost management and the elimination of
less profitable events

deferred events revenue decreased 24 to approximately 536 million at
september 30 2002 from 705 million at september 30 2001 the decrease in
deferred events revenue was due primarily to less favorable economic conditions
and to fewer events as described above

subsequent events

on october 30 2002 we announced that we expect to incur an estimated charge of
about 25 million in the quarter ending december 31 2002 for reductions in
facilities and workforce as we continue to align our business resources with
revenue expectations

on october 30 2002 we announced that our board of directors approved a change
of our fiscal year from september 30 to december 31 the change in fiscal year
end will better align our overall operations with our sales organization which
was already operating under a december 31 year end to correspond with the year
end of the majority of our clients as well as our competitors we expect to file
an audited form 10k transition report for the threemonth period ended december
31 2002

o    consulting revenue increased 28 to 2763 million in fiscal 2001 compared
     to 2167 million in fiscal 2000 and comprised approximately 29 and 25
     of total revenues in fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively

million for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 respectively the costs of services and
product development expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues to 47
from 46 the increase is attributable to growth in personnel costs associated
with the development and delivery of products and services

selling general and administrative expenses increased to 3701 million in
fiscal 2001 from 3419 million in fiscal 2000 the increase was due to
recruiting and facilities costs related to the growth in personnel as well as
increases in sales costs associated with revenue growth

depreciation expense increased to 409 million in fiscal 2001 from 278
million in fiscal 2000 primarily due to capital spending and internal use
software development costs required to support business growth including the
launch of the new gartnercom web site in january 2001 amortization of
intangibles of 124 million in fiscal 2001 was down from 130 million in
fiscal 2000

during 2001 we recorded other charges of 466 million of these charges 248
million are associated with the workforce reduction announced in april 2001
this workforce reduction has resulted in the elimination of 383 positions or
approximately 8 of our workforce approximately 143 million of the other
charges are associated with the writedown of goodwill and other longlived
assets

the termination benefits relating to the workforce reduction remained to be
paid we are funding these costs out of operating cash flows

million in fiscal 2000 in fiscal 2001 our united states canadian and
european businesses experienced declines in operating income of 49 and 21
respectively our other international business experienced an operating loss for
the year these operating results were all impacted by the other charges
recorded during fiscal 2001 on a consolidated basis operating income as a
percentage of total revenues was 4 and 10 respectively for fiscal 2001 and
2000 operating income was impacted in part by other charges and costs
associated with the rearchitecture of our internet capabilities and research
methodology and delivery processes and higher growth in lower margin
consultative services excluding the other charges operating income for fiscal
2001 was 9 of total revenues we decreased our staff by approximately 8 in the
second half of fiscal 2001 and in the fourth quarter decreased the expense to
revenue ratio on selling general and administrative expense by 24 percentage

net loss on sale of investments in fiscal 2001 of 06 million includes the sale
of the remaining 1922795 shares of jupiter for net cash proceeds of 75
million for a pretax loss of 56 million offset in part by the sale of shares
received from our venture capital funds si i and si ii for net cash proceeds of
60 million for a pretax gain of 50 million net gain on sale of investments
in fiscal 2000 reflects the sale of 1995950 shares of jupiter for net cash
proceeds of 555 million for a pretax gain of 429 million this gain was
partially offset by the sale of our 8 investment in netg inc a subsidiary of
harcourt inc to an affiliate of harcourt inc for 360 million in cash that
resulted in a pretax loss of approximately 66 million we acquired this
investment as consideration for our sale of gartnerlearning in september 1998
in addition in fiscal 2000 we settled a claim arising from the sale of
gartnerlearning to netg inc the claim asserted that we had breached a
contractual commitment under a joint venture to coproduce a product when the
business was sold the claim was settled for approximately 67 million and has
been recorded as a loss on sale of investments

net loss from minorityowned investments in fiscal 2001 of 268 million was
primarily the result of impairment losses related to investments owned by us
through si i si ii and other directly owned investments for other than
temporary declines in value we made an assessment of the carrying value of our
investments and determined that certain investments were in excess of their fair
value due to the significance and duration of the decline in valuation of
comparable companies operating in the internet and technology sectors see note
5  investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements the
impairment factors evaluated by management may change in subsequent periods
given that the entities underlying these investments operate in a volatile
business environment in addition these entities may require additional
financing to meet their cash and operational needs however there can be no
assurance that such funds will be available to the extent needed at terms
acceptable to the entities if at all this could result in additional material
noncash impairment charges in the future

interest expense decreased to 224 million in fiscal 2001 from 249 million in
fiscal 2000 the decrease related primarily to lower interest rates and lower
revolving credit borrowings compared to fiscal 2000 interest income of 16
million in fiscal 2001 was down from 39 million in fiscal 2000 due to a lower
average balance of funds available for investment and due to lower interest
rates other expense net increased to 37 million in fiscal 2001 from 07
million in fiscal 2000 the increase relates primarily to foreign currency
exchange losses

provision for income taxes on continuing operations was a benefit of 92
million in fiscal 2001 compared to a provision of 364 million in fiscal 2000
the effective tax rate in 2001 less the impact of a onetime tax benefit of
145 million due to the utilization of foreign tax credits in the second half
of the year and other charges and losses on investments and related tax impact
was 37 compared to 40 for fiscal 2000 the decrease in the effective tax rate
from fiscal 2000 is due to ongoing tax planning initiatives a more detailed
analysis of the changes in the provision benefit for income taxes is provided
in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

on july 2 2001 we sold our subsidiary techrepublic to cnet for approximately
235 million in cash and common stock of cnet before reduction for certain
termination benefits the proceeds were 143 million in cash and 755058 shares
of cnet common stock which had a fair market value of 1221 per share on july
2 2001 from july 2 2001 through september 30 2001 the market value of the
cnet shares declined substantially as a result we recorded a 39 million

other than temporary decline in market value of the cnet common stock the
consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the disposition
of the techrepublic segment as a discontinued operation in accordance with apb

segment analysis

research

research revenues grew 5 to 5351 million in fiscal 2001 as compared to
5098 million in the prior fiscal year the increase was due primarily to
higher client retention in north america the continued successful migration of
clients from legacy to seatbased pricing the increased penetration of new
buying centers within existing clients and continued focus on the growth of
gartnerg2 and gartner exp the new pricing structure provides broader access to
research compared to the traditional individual research subscription during
fiscal 2001 we launched gartnerg2 a new research service designed specifically
to help business executives use technology to enhance business growth and
productivity research gross contribution in fiscal 2001 increased to 3526
million from 3411 million in fiscal 2000 gross contribution margin decreased
slightly to 66 in fiscal 2001 from 67 in fiscal 2000 primarily a result of
the investments in gartnercom and the launch of gartnerg2 gross contribution
margin increased to 67 for the second half of fiscal 2001 from 64 for the
first half due in large part to cost reduction measures instituted during the
year

consulting

consulting revenues grew 28 to 2763 million in fiscal 2001 as compared to
2167 million in the prior fiscal year the increase was due primarily to an
increase in the number of projects increased project size and increases in
billing rates consulting gross contribution increased by 15 to 869 million
in fiscal 2001 from 757 million in fiscal 2000 consulting gross contribution
margin of 31 in fiscal 2001 decreased from 35 in fiscal 2000 primarily due to
increases in compensation expense related to the hiring of additional personnel
in the first half of fiscal 2001 coupled by an increase in nonbillable
services such as training participation in annual symposia events and
increased selling activity gross contribution margin increased to 39 for the
second half of fiscal 2001 from 22 for the first half due in large part to
cost reduction measures instituted during the year

events

events revenues grew 22 to 1327 million in fiscal 2001 as compared to 1086
million in the prior fiscal year the increase was due to greater attendance at
existing and new events as well as increased sponsorship and exhibit revenues
events gross contribution increased by 26 to 636 million in fiscal 2001 from
506 million in fiscal 2000 with gross contribution margin of 48 in 2001
compared to 47 in fiscal 2000 the increase in gross contribution margin was
due to the leveraging of existing events and an overall increase in sponsorship
and exhibitor sales

liquidity and capital resources

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2002 was 1456 million
compared to 735 million during fiscal 2001 the increase was primarily due to
significantly higher income from continuing operations lower amounts of
termination payments associated with workforce reductions and changes in balance
sheet working capital accounts

cash used in investing activities totaled 194 million for fiscal 2002
compared to 446 million used in fiscal 2001 cash used in investing activities
during fiscal 2002 and 2001 included 196 million and 575 million
respectively for additions to property equipment and leasehold improvements
these additions in fiscal 2002 were primarily the result of investments in
infrastructure systems these cash uses in fiscal 2002 were partially offset by
proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 60 million the additions
to property equipment and leasehold improvements in fiscal 2001 were primarily
the result of investments in gartnercom and other infrastructure systems these
cash uses in fiscal 2001 were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of
marketable securities and discontinued operations of 144 million and 105
million respectively cash used for business acquisitions was 45 million and
120 million for fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively

cash used in financing activities totaled 401 million in fiscal 2002 compared
to 189 million in fiscal 2001 the cash used in financing activities in fiscal
2002 resulted primarily from the purchase of treasury stock of 470 million
see discussion below under stock repurchases and the repayment of credit
facility loans 150 million offset in part by proceeds from the exercise
of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 222 million the cash
used in financing activities in fiscal 2001 resulted primarily from the purchase
of treasury stock of 379 million see discussion below under stock
repurchases offset in part by proceeds from credit facility borrowings 150
million and by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee
stock purchase plan 91 million

total cash used by discontinued operations sold in fiscal 2001 was 342
million in fiscal 2001 and 301 million in fiscal 2000

at september 30 2002 cash and cash equivalents totaled 1248 million the
effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by 17 million for
the year ended september 30 2002 and was due to the weakening of the us
dollar against certain foreign currencies in fiscal 2001 the negative effect
of exchange rates reduced cash and cash equivalents by 04 million cash and
cash equivalents are expected to decline during the three months ended december
31 2002 due to the payment of annual bonuses and commissions to our sales
force

obligations and commitments

we have a 2000 million unsecured senior revolving credit facility led by
jpmorgan chase bank at september 30 2002 there were no amounts outstanding
under the facility we are subject to certain customary affirmative negative
and financial covenants under this credit facility and continued compliance
with these covenants preclude us from borrowing the maximum amount of the credit
facility from time to time as a result of these covenants our borrowing
availability at september 30 2002 was 1189 million

on april 17 2000 we issued 3000 million of 6 convertible subordinated notes
to silver lake partners lp and certain of silver lakes affiliates slp in
a private placement transaction interest accrues semiannually by a
corresponding increase in the face amount of the notes accordingly 463
million has been added to the face amount of the notes resulting in a balance
outstanding of 3463 million at september 30 2002 these notes are due and
payable on april 17 2005

on or after april 17 2003 subject to satisfaction of certain customary
conditions we may redeem all of the convertible notes provided that 1 the
average closing price of our class a common stock for the twenty consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the date the redemption notice is given
equals or exceeds 11175 150 of the adjusted conversion price of 745 per
share and 2 the closing price of our class a common stock on the trading day
immediately preceding the date the redemption notice is given also equals or
exceeds 11175 the redemption price is the face amount of the notes plus all
accrued interest if we initiate the redemption slp has the option of receiving
payment in cash class a common stock at a conversion price of 745 per
share or a combination of cash and stock we are under no obligation to
initiate any such redemption

commencing on april 18 2003 or prior to that date should there be a change in
control of the company slp may convert all or a portion of the notes to stock
if slp initiates the conversion we have the option of redeeming all the notes
for cash at the market price of our common stock on the date the notice of
conversion is given additionally if we were to redeem all of the notes for
cash in response to slps election to convert the notes to class a common stock
we would incur a significant earnings charge at the time of the redemption equal
to the difference between the market value of our class a common stock at the
time of redemption at the conversion price of 745 per share and the carrying
value of the notes at september 30 2002 the notes were convertible into 466
million shares with a total market value of 3771 million using our september
30 2002 class a common stock market price of 810 per share

on the maturity date april 17 2005 we must satisfy any remaining notes for
cash equal to the face amount of the notes plus accrued interest if none of the
notes has been redeemed or converted by that date such amount will be 4032
million

we also issue letters of credit in the ordinary course of business as of
september 30 2002 we had letters of credit outstanding with jpmorgan chase
bank for 37 million the bank of new york for 20 million and others for
01 million

we lease various facilities furniture and computer equipment under operating
lease arrangements expiring between 2003 and 2025 future commitments under
noncancelable operating lease agreements are 28 million 24 million 21
million 18 million and 17 million for fiscal 2003 2004 2005 2006 and 2007
respectively

the obligations remaining at september 30 2002 relative to the other charges
recorded in fiscal 2001 and in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 were 47
million in the aggregate 41 million is for the costs of facility reductions
principally lease payments and 06 million is for involuntary employee
termination severance and benefits payments for involuntary termination
severance and benefits will be made primarily over the next two quarters
payments relating to facility reductions will be made over the remaining lease
terms with the majority occurring over the next two to three years

we had a total remaining investment commitment to si ii of 59 million at
september 30 2002 which may be called by si ii at any time

we believe that our current cash balances together with cash anticipated to be
provided by operating activities and borrowings available under the existing
credit facility will be sufficient for our expected shortterm and foreseeable
longterm cash needs in the ordinary course of business if we were to require
substantial amounts of additional capital to pursue business opportunities that
may arise involving substantial investments of additional capital or for the
possible redemption of the convertible notes there can be no assurances that
such capital will be available to us or will be available on commercially
reasonable terms

million of class a and class b common stock on july 25 2002 the board of
directors increased the authorized stock repurchase program to 125 million of
our class a and class b common stock we expect to make repurchases from time to
time over the next two years through open market purchases block trades or
otherwise repurchases are subject to the availability of the stock prevailing
market conditions the trading price of the stock and our financial
performance repurchases will be funded from cash flow from operations and
possible borrowings under our existing credit facility through september 30

factors that may affect future results

we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves
numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control in
addition our clients and we are affected by the economy the following section
discusses many but not all of these risks and uncertainties

economic conditions our revenues and results of operations are influenced by
economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in
the it industry a general economic downturn or recession anywhere in the
world could negatively effect demand for our products and services and may
substantially reduce existing and potential client information
technologyrelated budgets the current economic downturn in the united states
and globally has led to constrained it spending which has impacted our business
and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and
results of operations including the ability to maintain continued customer
renewals and achieve contract value backlog and deferred events revenue to the
extent our clients are in the it industry the severe decline in that sector has
also had a significant impact on it spending

acts of terrorism or war acts of terrorism acts of war and other unforeseen
events may cause damage or disruption to our properties business employees
suppliers distributors and clients which could have an adverse effect on our
business financial condition and operating results such events may also result
in an economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere which could adversely
affect our business financial condition and operating results




                                       16

competitive environment we face direct competition from a significant number of
independent providers of information products and services we also compete
indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including
electronic and print media companies some of which may have greater financial
information gathering and marketing resources than we do these indirect
competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future in addition
limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we compete as a result
additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to
provide additional or complementary services additionally technological
advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources although
our market share has been increasing increased competition may result in loss
of market share diminished value in our products and services reduced pricing
and increased marketing expenditures we may not be successful if we cannot
compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery of
information customer service the ability to offer products to meet changing
market needs for information and analysis or price

renewal of research business by existing clients some of our success depends on
renewals of our subscriptionbased research products and services which
constituted 55 56 and 59 of our business for the years ended september 30
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively these research subscription agreements have
terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months our ability to maintain
contract renewals is subject to numerous factors including those described in
this annual report client retention rates were 75 74 and 74 for the years
ended september 30 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively any material decline in
renewal rates could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial
condition

nonrecurring consulting engagements consulting segment revenues constituted
30 29 and 25 of our business for the years ended september 30 2002 2001
and 2000 respectively such consulting engagements typically are projectbased
and nonrecurring our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to
numerous factors including those described in this annual report any material
decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse
impact on our revenues and our financial condition

hiring and retention of employees our success depends heavily upon the quality
of our senior management research analysts consultants sales and other key
personnel we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified
professionals from among others technology companies market research firms
consulting firms financial services companies and electronic and print media
companies some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these
professionals some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to
noncompete agreements that could impede our shortterm recruitment efforts any
failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified
personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our
business could adversely affect the quality of our products and services and
therefore our future business and operating results

maintenance of existing products and services we operate in a rapidly evolving
market and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and
timely research and analysis to our clients any failure to continue to provide
credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a
material adverse effect on future business and operating results further if
our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate
research our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may
decline in addition we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our
products and services in a costeffective manner failure to increase and
improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future
business and operating results

introduction of new products and services the market for our products and
services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and
analysis to maintain our competitive position we must continue to enhance and
improve our products and services develop or acquire new products and services
in a timely manner and appropriately position and price new products and
services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them any
failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services
could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or
financial position

international operations a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from
sales outside of north america representing 34 33 and 34 of our business
for the fiscal years ended september 30 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively as a
result our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international
business activities including general political and economic conditions in each
country changes in market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations and
tariffs and other trade barriers challenges in staffing and managing foreign
operations changes in regulatory requirements compliance with numerous foreign
laws and regulations different or overlapping tax structures higher levels of
united states taxation on foreign income and the difficulty of enforcing client
agreements collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property
rights in international jurisdictions we rely on local distributors or sales
agents in some international locations if any of these arrangements are
terminated by our agent or us we may not be able to replace the arrangement on
beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or
sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent

branding we believe that our gartner brand is critical to our efforts to
attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will
increase as competition increases we may expand our marketing activities to
promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing
budget hire additional marketing and public relations personnel expend
additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to
create and maintain client brand loyalty if we fail to effectively promote and




                                       17
page

maintain the gartner brand or incur excessive expenses in doing so our future
business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted

investment activities we maintain investments in equity securities in private
and publicly traded companies through direct ownership and through wholly and
partially owned venture capital funds the companies we invest in are primarily
early to midstage itbased and internetenabled businesses there are numerous
risks related to such investments due to their nature and the volatile public
markets including significant delay or failure of anticipated returns in
addition these entities may require additional financing to meet their cash and
operational needs however there can be no assurance that such funds will be
available to the extent needed at terms acceptable to the entities if at all
as a result our financial results and financial position could be materially
impacted

indebtedness we have incurred significant indebtedness through our 3463
million convertible notes additionally we have a 2000 million senior
revolving credit facility under which we can incur significant additional
indebtedness the affirmative negative and financial covenants of these debt
facilities could limit our future financial flexibility the associated debt
service costs could impair future operating results our outstanding debt may
limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us which could
restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to
competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring
substantial investments of additional capital on the maturity date april 17
2005 we must satisfy any remaining notes for cash equal to the face amount of
the notes plus accrued interest if none of the notes have been redeemed or
converted by that date such amount will be 4032 million the payment of this
amount could materially adversely impact our future business and operating
results

convertible notes commencing on april 18 2003 or sooner in certain
circumstances upon a change in control of the company the holders of our 3463
million convertible notes may elect to convert all or a portion of the notes to
shares of our class a common stock if all or a substantial portion of the notes
are converted the note holders will own a substantial number of shares of our
class a common stock at september 30 2002 the notes were convertible into
466 million shares of our class a common stock which would constitute 362 of
our combined class a and class b common stock outstanding on that date this is
based upon the conversion price of 745 per share if the holders elect to
convert the notes we may redeem them see obligations and commitments and
indebtedness above if we do not redeem the notes and all or a substantial
portion of the notes are converted the holder of the notes slp will become
our largest shareholder based upon our shareholder base as of september 30
2002 this in turn may 1 give slp the ability to exercise significant
control over the company 2 create significant dilution for other
shareholders and 3 may cause volatility in our stock price if we want to
redeem the convertible notes in response to the note holders election to
convert or on our own under certain circumstances there can be no assurance
that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital on a commercially reasonable
basis or at all in order to fund a redemption even if we could obtain
sufficient capital to fund a redemption it could materially adversely impact
our future business and operating results

organizational and product integration related to acquisitions we have made and
may continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses
that offer complementary products and services the risks involved in each
acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value
we derive from the acquisition dilution of the interests of our current
stockholders or decreased working capital increased indebtedness the
assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the
ability to integrate successfully the operations and personnel of the acquired
business the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company the time
to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired
company the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of
management from our business the realization of any of these risks could
adversely affect our business

enforcement of our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of
copyright patent trademark trade secret confidentiality noncompete and
other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights unauthorized
third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard
as proprietary our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal
challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us the laws
of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as
the laws of the united states accordingly we may not be able to protect our
intellectual property against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use which
could adversely affect our competitive position our employees are subject to
noncompete agreements when the noncompetition period expires former
employees may compete against us if a former employee chooses to compete
against us prior to the expiration of the noncompetition period there is no
assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the noncompete
provision

possibility of infringement claims third parties may assert infringement claims
against us regardless of the merits responding to any such claim could be time
consuming result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and
licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a
substitute technology our business results of operations or financial position
could be materially adversely affected

agreements with ims health incorporated in connection with our recapitalization
in july 1999 we agreed to certain restrictions on business activity to reduce
the risk to ims health and its stockholders of substantial tax liabilities
associated with the spinoff by ims health of its equity interest in us we also
agreed to assume the risk of such tax liabilities if we were to undertake
certain business activities that give rise to the liabilities as a result we
may be limited in our ability to undertake acquisitions involving the issuance
of a





                                       18
page

significant amount of stock unless we were to seek and obtain a ruling from the
irs that the transaction will not give rise to such tax liabilities in
addition we agreed to certain limits on the purchase of our common stock under
the terms of the recapitalization

potential fluctuations in operating results our quarterly and annual operating
income may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors including the
timing of the execution of research contracts which typically occurs in the
fourth calendar quarter the extent of completion of consulting engagements the
timing of symposia and other events which also occur to a greater extent in the
fourth calendar quarter the amount of new business generated the mix of
domestic and international business changes in market demand for our products
and services the timing of the development introduction and marketing of new
products and services and competition in the industry an inability to generate
sufficient earnings and cash flow and achieve our forecasts may impact our
operating and other activities the potential fluctuations in our operating
income could cause periodtoperiod comparisons of operating results not to be
meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results

euro conversion

effective january 1 2002 twelve of the fifteen member countries of the
european union adopted the euro as their single currency the participating
countries issued new eurodenominated bills and coins for use in cash
transactions effective july 1 2002 legacy currency is no longer legal tender
for any transactions in the participating countries we do not believe that the
translation of financial transactions into euros has had or will have a
significant effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial
condition we do not anticipate any material impact from the euro conversion on
our financial information systems which accommodate multiple currencies costs
associated with the adoption of the euro have not been and are not expected to
be significant and are being expensed as incurred

recently issued accounting standards

in november 2001 the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue
no 0114 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for
outofpocket expenses incurred the consensus requires reimbursements

applied to financial reporting periods beginning after december 15 2001 with
reclassification of prior periods for comparability we adopted the consensus
beginning with the second quarter of our fiscal year that began on january 1
2002 and in accordance with the consensus have restated prior periods for the
years ended september 30 2002 2001 and 2000 adoption of the consensus caused
both revenues and cost of services and product development in the consulting

respectively

in april 2002 statement of financial accounting standards no 145 rescission
of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and
technical corrections sfas no 145 was issued fasb statement no 4
required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be reported as
extraordinary items and statement no 64 related to the same matter sfas no
145 requires gains and losses from certain debt extinguishment to not be
reported as extraordinary items when the use of debt extinguishment is part of
the risk management strategy statement no 44 was issued to establish
transitional requirements for motor carriers relative to intangible assets
those transitions are completed therefore statement 44 is no longer necessary
sfas no 145 also amends statement no 13 requiring saleleaseback accounting
for certain lease modifications sfas no 145 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after may 15 2002 which will be our 2003 fiscal year the provisions
relating to saleleaseback are effective for transactions after may 15 2002
the adoption of sfas no 145 is not expected to have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations upon adoption in 2003 the
extraordinary loss from the extinguishment of debt net of taxes of 18
million or 002 per share in fiscal 2000 will be reclassified to continuing
operations

in july 2002 statement of financial accounting standards no 146 accounting
for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 146 was issued
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue
eitf 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits
and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a
restructuring the principal difference between sfas 146 and eitf 943 relates
to the timing of liability recognition under sfas 146 a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is
incurred under eitf 943 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the
date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan the provisions of sfas 146 are
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31
2002 the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact
on our financial position or results of operations as approval and finalization
of our recent workforce and facility reductions announced on october 30 2002
were initiated prior to the sfas 146 effective date

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk

as of september 30 2002 we have exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates primarily from borrowings under longterm debt which consists of
a 2000 million unsecured senior revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase
bank and 3463 million of 6 convertible subordinated notes see note 10debt
in the notes to consolidated financial statements at september 30 2002 there
were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility under the
revolving credit facility the interest rate on borrowings is libor plus an
additional 100 to 200 basis points based on our debttoebitda ratio we believe
that an increase or decrease of 10 in the effective interest rate on available
borrowings from our senior revolving credit facility if fully utilized would
not have a material effect on our future results of operations if markets were
to decline we could be required to accrue interest on the 6 convertible debt
that would exceed those based on current market rates each 25 basis point
decrease in interest would have an associated annual opportunity cost of
approximately 09 million based on the september 30 2002 balance each 25
basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximate
05 million annual effect under the revolving credit facility if fully
utilized

forward purchase agreements

beginning in 1997 we entered into a series of forward purchase agreements that
extended through may 2003 to offset the dilutive effect of stockbased employee
compensation plans these agreements were settled quarterly on a net basis in
either shares of class a common stock or cash at the companys option during
the year ended september 30 2001 two settlements resulted in our issuance of
491789 shares of class a common stock and our payment of approximately 64000
in cash during the quarter ended june 30 2001 we reacquired 1164154 shares
of class a common stock for approximately 97 million through an early
termination of the remaining forward purchase agreements as of september 30
2001 there were no remaining commitments under these forward purchase
agreements

investment risk

we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of
our equity investments we invest in equity securities of public and private
companies directly and through si i a whollyowned affiliate and si ii of
which we own 34 si i and si ii are engaged in making venture capital
investments in early to midstage itbased or internetenabled companies see
note 5  investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as
of september 30 2002 we had investments in equity securities totaling 127
million unrealized losses of 945000 have been recorded net of deferred taxes
of 630000 as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets these
investments are inherently risky as the businesses are typically in early
development stages and may never develop further certain of these investments
are in publicly traded companies whose shares are subject to significant market
price volatility adverse changes in market conditions and poor operating
results of the underlying investments may result in us incurring additional
losses or an inability to recover the original carrying value of our
investments if there were a 100 adverse change in the value of our equity
portfolio as of september 30 2002 this would result in a noncash impairment
charge of 127 million we intend to sell all of our investments owned through
si i and si ii

foreign currency exchange risk

we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and
transaction risk amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into
us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date the
resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity deficit section
of the consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect
revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar
since the functional currency of our foreign operations are generally
denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries the foreign currency
translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity and
do not impact operating results revenues and expenses in foreign currencies
translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us
dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies therefore changes in
exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as
expressed in us dollars from foreign operations currency transaction gains
or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional
currency are included in results of operations

from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or
other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal 2002 we had a
contract requiring us to sell us dollars and purchase japanese yen the
contract was for 10 million a oneyear term that expired on september 27
2002 and contained a forward exchange rate of 11426 japanese yen the foreign
currency forward contract was entered into to offset the foreign exchange
effects of our japanese yen intercompany payable which had a value of 10
million on september 27 2002 we settled this contract by paying 50000 at
september 30 2002 we had two foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
foreign exchange forward contracts are reflected at fair value with gains and
losses recorded currently in earnings

1summary of significant accounting policies

         basis of presentation the fiscal year of gartner inc the company
represents the period from october 1 through september 30 references to 2002
2001 and 2000 unless otherwise indicated are to the respective fiscal year
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation

         principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the company and its majorityowned subsidiaries all
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
investments in companies in which the company owns less than 50 but has the
ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies
are accounted for using the equity method all other investments for which the
company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are
accounted for under the cost method of accounting the results of operations for
acquisitions of companies accounted for using the purchase method have been
included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning on the closing
date of acquisition

         revenue and commission expense recognition the company typically
enters into annually renewable subscription contracts for research products
revenue from research products is deferred and recognized ratably over the
applicable contract terms the majority of research contracts are billable upon
signing absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all
research contracts are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government
contracts that have a 30day cancellation clause but have not produced material
cancelations to date with the exception of certain government contracts which
permit termination and contracts with special billing terms it is the companys
policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee
receivable at the time the contract is signed which represents a legally
enforceable claim and a corresponding amount as deferred revenue for those
government contracts that permit termination the company bills the client the
full amount billable under the contract but only records a receivable equal to
the earned portion of the contract in addition the company only records
deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received deferred
revenue attributable to government contracts were 289 million and 245
million at september 30 2002 and 2001 respectively in addition at september
30 2002 and 2001 the company had not recognized receivables or deferred
revenues relating to government contracts that permit termination of 77
million and 133 million respectively which had been billed but not yet
collected the company records the commission obligation related to research
contracts upon the signing of the contract and amortizes the corresponding
deferred commission expense over the contract period in which the related
revenues are earned

         consulting revenues primarily derived from consulting measurement and
strategic advisory services paid oneday analyst engagements are recognized
primarily on a percentage of completion basis and on a time and materials basis
as work is performed and services are provided on a contract by contract basis

         events revenue is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the
related symposium conference or exhibition in addition the company defers
certain costs directly related to events and expenses these costs in the period
during which the related symposium conference or exhibition occurs the
companys policy is to defer only those costs primarily prepaid site and
production services costs which are incremental and are directly attributable
to a specific event other costs of organizing and producing the companys
events primarily company personnel and nonevent specific expenses are
expensed in the period incurred at the end of each fiscal quarter management
assesses on an eventbyevent basis whether expected direct costs of producing a
scheduled event will exceed expected revenues if such costs are expected to
exceed revenues the company records the expected loss in the period determined

         other revenues includes software licensing fees which are recognized
when a signed noncancelable software license exists delivery has occurred
collection is probable and the companys fees are fixed or determinable
revenue from software maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the
term of each maintenance agreement which is typically twelve months

         cash and cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents the
carrying value of these investments approximates fair value based upon their
shortterm maturity investments with maturities of more than three months are
classified as marketable securities

         investments in equity securities the company accounts for its
investments in publicly traded equity securities under statement of financial
accounting standards sfas  no 115 accounting for certain investments in
debt and equity securities these investments which meet the criteria for
classification as available for sale are recorded at fair value and are
included as marketable equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets
given the companys ability and intent to sell such investments within a one
year period unrealized gains and losses on these marketable investments are
recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
loss net within the stockholders equity deficit section of the
consolidated balance sheets realized gains and losses are recorded in net gain
loss from sale of investments within the consolidated statements of
operations the cost of equity securities sold is based on specific
identification the company assesses the need to record impairment losses on
investments and records such losses when the impairment of an investment is
determined to be other than temporary in nature in making this assessment the
company considers the significance and duration of the decline in value and the
valuation of comparable companies operating in the





                                       33

internet and technology sectors the impairment factors the company evaluates
may change in subsequent periods since the entities underlying these
investments operate in a volatile business environment in addition these
entities may require additional financing to meet their cash and operational
needs however there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to
the extent needed at terms acceptable to the entities if at all these
impairment losses are reflected in net loss from minorityowned investments
within the consolidated statements of operations investments for which the
company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are
accounted for under the cost method of accounting accordingly these
investments are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are
included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets see note 5 
investments the equity method is used to account for investments in entities
that are not majorityowned and that the company does not control but does have
the ability to exercise significant influence

         property equipment and leasehold improvements property equipment and
leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization property and equipment are depreciated using the straightline
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the related leases

         software development costs the company capitalizes certain computer
software development costs and enhancements after the establishment of
technological feasibility limited to the net realizable value of the software
product and ceases capitalization when the software product is available for
general release to clients until these products reach technological
feasibility all costs related to development efforts are charged to expense
once technological feasibility has been determined additional costs incurred in
development including coding testing and documentation are capitalized
amortization of software development costs is provided on a productbyproduct
basis over the estimated economic life of the software generally two years
using the straightline method amortization of capitalized computer software
development costs begins when the products are available for general release to
customers additionally the company capitalizes certain costs incurred to
purchase or to create and implement internal use software periodic reviews are
performed to ensure that unamortized capitalized software development costs
remain recoverable from future revenue

         goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets include noncompete
agreements trademarks and tradenames goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the
tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired effective october 1
2001 the company adopted early sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets sfas no 142 eliminates goodwill amortization upon adoption and
requires an initial assessment for goodwill impairment within six months after
initial adoption and at least annually thereafter no goodwill amortization was
recognized during the year ended september 30 2002 the company completed its
initial transitional goodwill impairment assessment in the second fiscal quarter
of 2002 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill and no
impairment charge to be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in accordance with sfas no 142 noncompete agreements are
being amortized on a straightline basis over the period of the agreement
ranging from two to five years tradenames are being amortized on a
straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from nine to
twelve years in addition no impairment was recognized as a result of the
companys annual evaluation

         impairment of longlived assets and intangible assets the company
reviews longlived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the respective asset may not be recoverable such evaluation
may be based on a number of factors including current and projected operating
results and cash flows changes in managements strategic direction as well as
other economic and market variables managements policy regarding longlived
assets and intangible assets other than goodwill is to evaluate the
recoverability of these assets by determining whether the balance can be
recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows should events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable based on
undiscounted future operating cash flows an impairment loss would be
recognized the amount of impairment if any is measured based on the
difference between projected discounted future operating cash flows using a
discount rate reflecting the companys average cost of funds and the carrying
value of the asset see note 6  other charges

         foreign currency translation all assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at fiscal yearend exchange rates
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as foreign currency
translation adjustments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income loss within the stockholders equity deficit section of the
consolidated balance sheets income and expense items are translated at average
exchange rates for the year currency transaction gains or losses arising from
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
included in results of operations within other expense net within the
consolidated statements of operations

         income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based
on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using
presently enacted tax rates the provision for income taxes is the sum of the
amount of income tax paid or payable for the year as determined by applying the
provisions of enacted tax laws to taxable income for that year and the net
changes during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities undistributed
earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us amounted to approximately 400
million as of september 30 2002 and will either be indefinitely reinvested or
remitted substantially free of us tax accordingly no material provision has
been made for taxes that may be payable upon remittance of such earnings nor is
it practicable to determine the amount of any liability the company credits
additional paidin capital for realized tax benefits arising from stock
transactions with employees the





                                       34

tax benefit on a nonqualified stock option is equal to the tax effect of the
difference between the market price of the companys common stock on the date of
exercise and the exercise price

         fair value of financial instruments the companys financial
instruments include cash and cash equivalents fees receivable accounts
payable and accruals which are shortterm in nature the carrying amounts of
these financial instruments approximate their fair value investments in
publicly traded equity securities are valued based on quoted market prices
investments in equity securities that are not publicly traded are valued at the
lower of cost or net realizable value which approximates fair market value

         longterm convertible debt consists of 6 convertible subordinated
notes see note 10debt although there were no amounts outstanding at
september 30 2002 under a senior revolving credit facility the carrying amount
of any such borrowings would approximate fair value as the rates of interest on
the revolving credit facility approximate current market rates of interest for
similar instruments with comparable maturities

         concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially
subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
and cash equivalents marketable equity securities and fees receivable
concentrations of credit risk with respect to fees receivable are limited due to
the large number of clients comprising the client base and their dispersion
across many different industries and geographic regions

         use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states
of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets liabilities and disclosures if any of contingent
assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results
could differ from those estimates estimates are used when accounting for such
items as allowance for doubtful accounts investments depreciation
amortization income taxes and certain accrued liabilities

         recently issued accounting standards in november 2001 the emerging
issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 0114 income statement
characterization of reimbursements received for outofpocket expenses
incurred the consensus requires reimbursements received for outofpocket
expenses incurred to be characterized as revenue in the statements of
operations outofpocket expenses are incidental expenses incurred as part of
ongoing operations and include but are not limited to expenses related to
airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals photocopies and
telecommunication and facsimile charges this consensus must be applied to
financial reporting periods beginning after december 15 2001 with
reclassification of prior periods for comparability the company adopted the
consensus beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2002 and in accordance
with the consensus reclassified prior periods for the years ended september
30 2002 2001 and 2000 adoption of the consensus caused both revenues and cost
of services and product development in the consulting segment to increase by
100 million 108 million and 79 million respectively

         in april 2002 statement of financial accounting standards no 145
rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement
no 13 and technical corrections sfas no 145 was issued fasb statement
no 4 required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be
reported as extraordinary items and statement no 64 related to the same matter
fas 145 requires gains and losses from certain debt extinguishment to not be
reported as extraordinary items when the use of debt extinguishment is part of
the risk management strategy statement no 44 was issued to establish
transitional requirements for motor carriers relative to intangible assets
since those transitions are completed statement 44 is no longer applicable
sfas no 145 also amends statement no 13 requiring saleleaseback accounting
for certain lease modifications sfas no 145 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after may 15 2002 fiscal 2003 for gartner the provisions relating
to saleleaseback are effective for transactions after may 15 2002 the
adoption of sfas no 145 is not expected to have a material impact on the
companys financial position or results of operations upon adoption in 2003
the extraordinary loss from the extinguishment of debt net of taxes of 18
million or 002 per share in fiscal 2000 will be reclassified to continuing
operations

in july 2002 statement of financial accounting standards no 146 accounting
for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 146 was issued
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue
eitf 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits
and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a
restructuring the principle difference between sfas 146 and eitf 943 relates
to the timing of liability recognition under sfas 146 a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is
incurred under eitf 943 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the
date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan the provisions of sfas 146 are
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31
2002 the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact
on the companys financial position or results of operations as approval of the
companys workforce and facility reductions announced on october 30 2002 were
initiated prior to the sfas no 146 effective date see note 18  subsequent

certain investments are reflected in net loss from minorityowned investments
in the consolidated statements of operations the company made an assessment of
the carrying value of its investments and determined that certain investments
were in excess of their fair value due to the significance and duration of the
decline and due to the valuation of comparable companies operating in the
internet and technology sectors the impairment factors the company evaluated
may change in subsequent periods since the entities underlying these
investments operate in a volatile business environment in addition these
entities may require additional financing to meet their cash and operational
needs however there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to
the extent needed at terms acceptable to the entities if at all this could
result in additional material noncash impairment charges in the future

competition

the company believes that the principal competitive factors in its industry are
quality of research and analysis timely delivery of information customer
service the ability to offer products that meet changing market needs for
information and analysis and price the company believes it competes favorably
with respect to each of these factors

the company faces competition from a significant number of independent providers
of information products and services as well as the internal marketing and
planning organizations of the companys clients the company also competes
indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers including
electronic and print media companies these indirect competitors could choose to
compete directly with the company in the future in addition limited barriers
to entry exist in the companys market as a result additional new competitors
may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or
complementary services increased competition may result in loss of market
share diminished value in the companys products and services reduced pricing
and increased marketing expenditures the company may not be successful if it
cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis timely delivery
of information customer service the ability to offer products to meet changing
market needs for information and analysis and price

bargaining arrangement the company has experienced no work stoppages and
considers its relations with employees to be favorable

the companys future success depends heavily upon the quality of its senior
management sales personnel it analysts consultants and other key personnel
the company faces intense competition for these qualified professionals from
among others technology and internet companies market research firms
consulting firms and electronic and print media companies some of the personnel
that the company attempts to hire are subject to noncompetition agreements that
could impede the companys shortterm recruitment efforts any failure to retain
key personnel or hire additional qualified personnel as may be required to
support the evolving needs of clients or growth in the companys business could
adversely affect the quality of the companys products and services and
therefore its future business and operating results

                                        1999 primarily due to upcoming symposia and itxpo events to occur in
                                        the first quarter of fiscal 2001


contract value is a significant measure of the companys volume of business the
companys past experience has been that a substantial portion of client
companies renew these subscriptionbased products for an equal or higher level
of total payments each year in addition the company has also been able to
increase its multiyear contracts to 40 of total contract value at september
30 2000 from 32 at september 30 1999 total research deferred revenues of
2969 million and 2911 million at september 30 2000 and 1999 respectively
represent unamortized revenues from billed products and services deferred
revenues do not directly correlate to contract value as of the same date since
contract value represents an annualized value of all outstanding contracts
without regard to the duration of such contracts and deferred revenue
represents unamortized revenue remaining on all outstanding and billed
contracts

    the company has generally realized significant renewals and growth in
contract value at the end of each quarter the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
typically has been the fastest growth quarter for contract value and the first
quarter has been the slowest growth quarter due to the largest amount of
contract renewals as a result of growth in contract value and overall business
volume fees receivable deferred revenues deferred commissions and commissions
payable reflect this activity and typically show substantial increases at
quarter end and at fiscal year end all contracts are billable upon signing
absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time all contracts
are noncancelable and nonrefundable except for government contracts which
have a 30day cancellation clause but have not produced material cancellations
to date in accordance with the contract terms the company records at the time
of signing of a research and measurement contract the entire amount of the
contract billable as a fee receivable which represents a legally enforceable
claim and a corresponding amount as deferred revenue deferred revenues
attributable to government contracts were 338 million and 362 million at
september 30 2000 and 1999 respectively the company also records the related
commission obligation upon the signing of the contract and amortizes the
corresponding deferred commission expense over the contract period in which the
related revenues are earned and amortized to income

    research revenues typically increase in the first quarter of the fiscal year
over the immediately preceding quarter primarily due to the increase in contract
value at the end of the prior fiscal year events revenues have increased
similarly due to annual conferences and exhibition events held in the first
quarter additionally operating income margin operating income as a percentage
of total revenues typically improves in the first quarter of the fiscal year
versus the immediately preceding quarter the operating income margin
improvement in the first quarter of a fiscal year is generally due to the
increase in research revenue upon which the company is able to further leverage
its selling general and administrative expenses plus operating income
generated from the first quarter symposium and itxpo exhibition events although
historically operating income margin has generally not been as high in the
remaining quarters especially the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year
compared to the first quarter of the fiscal year the full year impact of
techrepublic and other acquisitions and strategic initiatives may result in
operating margin trends in the future that are not comparable to historical
trends

    during fiscal 2000 the company made significant investments in the hiring

    in addition the companys internet segment techrepublic provided 41
million of revenue in fiscal 2000 that consisted primarily of revenue from the
sale of advertisements expansion of techrepublics registered user population
has contributed to its ability to sequentially grow advertising revenues in
fiscal 2000 the ability of techrepublic to maintain or increase advertising
rates and volumes will depend in part on the level and quality of traffic on
the techrepublic site and the ability to develop content and services that
attract retain and expand a loyal user base that is attractive to advertisers
and sellers

7342 million in fiscal 1999 revenues from research
page   9
products increased 6 in fiscal 2000 to 5098 million compared to 4790
million in fiscal 1999 and comprised approximately 59 and 65 of total revenues
in fiscal 2000 and 1999 respectively consulting revenue consisting primarily
of consulting and measurement engagements increased 39 to 2088 million in
fiscal 2000 as compared to 1498 million in fiscal 1999 and comprised

756 million in fiscal 1999 other revenues consisting principally of software
licensing fees and techrepublic experienced a slight increase of 17 million
to 315 million in fiscal 2000 from 298 million in fiscal 1999 although the
rate of growth in total company revenues declined slightly in fiscal 2000 the
increase in total revenues reflects the ability of the company to gain client
acceptance of new products and services deliver high value consultative
services increase sales penetration into new and existing clients and develop
incremental revenues from current and prior year acquisitions consulting
backlog increased 32 to approximately 944 million at september 30 2000 and
represents future revenues that will be recognized on inprocess consulting and
measurement engagements

    revenue has grown in the three defined geographic market areas of the
company united states and canada europe and other international revenues
from sales to united states clients increased 20 to 5676 million in fiscal
2000 from 4718 million in fiscal 1999 revenues from sales to european clients
increased 9 to 2303 million in fiscal 2000 from 2121 million in fiscal
1999 although european revenues increased in fiscal 2000 the rate of growth
was less than in fiscal 1999 this decrease in growth rate was attributable in
part to research revenues remaining relatively unchanged from fiscal 1999 as a
result of foreign exchange rates on a constant dollar basis revenues from
europe would have increased 16 compared to fiscal 1999 revenues from sales to
other international clients increased by 21 to 607 million in fiscal 2000
from 503 million in fiscal 1999 this increase reflects primarily the general
recovery in the economic climate in the asian markets from fiscal 1999

    the companys sales strategy is to continue to extend the companys sales
channels to clients with revenues ranging from 150 million and up to maintain
its focus on large customers and to expand sales of product and service
offerings to smaller companies and to different user bases within existing and
potential larger company clients the company continues to invest in direct
sales personnel and distributor relationships in europe and other international
markets and intends to pursue continued expansion of operations outside of the
united states in fiscal 2001

    operating income decreased 63 to 482 million in fiscal 2000 compared to
1318 million in fiscal 1999 in fiscal 2000 the united states and canada
europe and other international markets experienced declines in operating income
of 63 63 and 71 respectively on a consolidated basis operating income as
a percentage of total revenues was 6 and 18 respectively for fiscal 2000 and
1999 operating income was impacted in part by expenditures related to planned
investments and rearchitecture of the companys web capabilities and the
research methodology and delivery processes the hiring of analysts and
consultants higher growth in lower margin consultative services and other
investments to expand and augment techrepublics initiatives additionally
techrepublics operating loss of 342 million in fiscal 2000 impacted
significantly the companys operating income

    costs and expenses excluding other charges in fiscal 1999 increased to
8105 million in fiscal 2000 from 5790 million in fiscal 1999 the increase
in costs and expenses reflects the additional support required for the growing
client base incremental costs associated with conferences costs associated
with acquired businesses and previously planned strategic investments which
included the hiring of additional consultants analysts project executives and
sales personnel and spending on sales productivity tools and interactive
initiatives cost of services and product development expenses were 4117
million and 2936 million for fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 respectively the
increase in costs of services and product development expenses as a percentage
of total revenues to 48 from 40 is primarily attributable to continuing
growth in personnel costs associated with the development and delivery of
products and services and the hiring of personnel in association with the
planned strategic investments costs and expenses in fiscal 2000 were also
impacted by the amounts earned by employees under the retention bonus program as
well as the performancerelated variable compensation expense incurred in fiscal
2000 in contrast costs and expenses in fiscal 1999 were favorably impacted
through the elimination of variable compensation costs linked to financial
performance

    selling general and administrative expenses increased to 3426 million in
fiscal 2000 from 2537 million in fiscal 1999 as a result of the companys
continued expansion of worldwide distribution channels and additional general
and administrative resources needed to meet the expanding infrastructure
requirements of the growing revenue base and fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999
acquisitions these infrastructure requirements involve information systems
support telecommunication facilities and human capital costs

    in fiscal 1999 the company recorded pretax other charges totaling 92
million of legal and advisory fees related to the recapitalization see note
15recapitalization in the notes to consolidated financial statements and
142 million of costs primarily severance related incurred as part of
strategic reduction in workforce initiatives

    depreciation expense increased to 283 million in fiscal 2000 from 216
million in fiscal 1999 primarily due to capital spending required to support
business growth additionally amortization of intangibles increased by 178
million 148 million of which related to the techrepublic acquisition in
fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 reflecting primarily goodwill associated
with fiscal 2000 and 1999 acquisitions and the shorter life of intangibles
attributable to internet related fiscal 2000 acquisitions

     net gain on sale of investments in fiscal 2000 reflects the sale of
1995950 shares of jupiter communications inc now known as jupiter media
metrix for net cash proceeds of 555 million for a pretax gain of 429
million this gain was partially offset by the sale of the companys 8
investment in netg inc a subsidiary of harcourt inc to an affiliate of
harcourt inc for 360 million in cash that resulted in a pretax loss of
approximately 66 million the company had acquired this investment as
consideration for its sale of gartnerlearning in september 1998 in addition
gartner settled a claim arising from the sale of gartnerlearning to netg inc in
1998 the claim asserted that the company had breached its contractual
commitment under its joint venture arrangement with a content partner when the
business was sold the claim was settled for approximately 67 million and has
been recorded as a loss on sale of investments interest expense increased to
249 million in fiscal 2000 from 13 million in fiscal 1999 this increase
related primarily to debt facility borrowings of which the proceeds were used
primarily to fund the companys recapitalization in the prior fiscal year
interest income and other decreased in fiscal 2000 which was due primarily to a
lower average balance of investable funds as compared to the prior fiscal year

    provision for income taxes decreased by 43 or 222 million to 288
million in fiscal 2000 from 510 million in fiscal 1999 the effective tax rate
was 52 and 37 for fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 respectively the increase in
the effective rate principally reflects the impact of nondeductible goodwill
related to the techrepublic acquisition a more detailed analysis of the changes
in the provision for income taxes is provided in note 13 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements

    in fiscal 2000 the company entered into a second amendment to the credit

existing credit agreement in connection with the extinguishment of the term
loan the company wroteoff 29 million of deferred debt issuance costs in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 the charge was recorded net of tax benefit of
12 million as an extraordinary loss

from operations before interest income and expense certain selling general and
administrative expenses amortization income taxes other charges and foreign
exchange gains and losses

research
research revenues grew 6 to 5098 million as compared to 4790 million in the
prior fiscal year due to increased sales penetration into new and existing
clients contributing to the growth in sales was the introduction of a new
pricing architecture launched in the third quarter of fiscal 2000 this pricing
plan provides broad access to gartner research on price per seat basis research
gross contribution in fiscal 2000 increased slightly to 3411 million from
3369 million in fiscal 1999 gross contribution margin decreased to 67 in
fiscal 2000 from 70 in fiscal 1999 due primarily to slower revenue growth and
increases in compensation expenses associated with headcount and annual merit
increases

consulting
consulting revenue revenues grew 39 to 2088 million as compared to 1498
million in the prior fiscal year due primarily to an increase in demand for it
consulting also contributing the revenue growth was the full year impact of
prior year and current year acquisitions consulting gross contribution
increased by 35 to 757 million in fiscal 2000 from 559 million in fiscal
1999 consulting gross contribution margin of 36 in fiscal 2000 decreased from
37 in fiscal 1999 primarily due to the impact of integration costs and lower
margins associated with new strategic consulting practices and recent consulting
related acquisitions

events

million in the prior fiscal year due to a growth in attendance at existing and
new events and increased sponsorships and exhibit revenues events gross

in fiscal 1999 with gross contribution margin increasing to 47 in 2000 from 43

the ability of the company to leverage existing event infrastructure selected
price adjustments and an overall increase in sponsorship and exhibitor sales

techrepublic
techrepublic acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2000 contributed 41
million in revenue more than half of the annual revenue was earned in the
fourth quarter techrepublics revenue is primarily earned from advertising and
subscription services techrepublic incurred a segment loss of 203 million

an increase of 54 over 491 million in fiscal 1998 other revenues consisting
principally of software licensing fees experienced a slight decrease to 298
million in fiscal 1999 from 307 million in fiscal 1998 although the rate of
growth in company revenue slowed in fiscal 1999 the increase in total revenues
reflected the ability of the company to gain client acceptance of new products
and services increase sales penetration into new and existing clients and
develop incremental revenues from current and prior year acquisitions pricing
pressures in the companys traditional research products from smaller
competitors with lower profit margins and less robust product suites contributed
to the slowed revenue growth rate consulting backlog increased 68 to
approximately 716 million at september 30 1999 and represented future
revenues that would be recognized from inprocess consulting and measurement
engagements

    revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients increased 14 to
4718 million in fiscal 1999 from 4156 million in fiscal 1998 revenues from
sales to european clients increased 22 to 2121 million in fiscal 1999 from
1738 million in fiscal 1998 revenue in europe primarily in the research
area increased as a result of continuing investments to expand penetration of
this market offset in part by lower than expected growth in measurement
revenues revenues from sales to other international clients decreased by 4 to
503 million in fiscal 1999 from 526 million in fiscal 1998 this decrease
was caused primarily by the general unfavorable economic climate in the asian
markets

    operating income decreased 8 to 1318 million in fiscal 1999 from 1440
million in fiscal 1998 excluding acquisitionrelated and other charges
operating income in fiscal 1999 increased 3 excluding such charges in 1999 and
1998 the united states and canada experienced an increase of 2 and europe
experienced a 16 growth rate other international markets experienced a decline
of 25 primarily from a decrease in revenue operating income remained favorable
as a result of continuing revenue growth that allowed the company to develop new
products and services and to gain economies of scale through the leveraging of
its resources additional revenues have been generated using essentially the
same resources however operating contribution margin excluding acquisition
related and other charges decreased in fiscal 1999 to 21 from 24 in fiscal
1998 this decrease was due in part to higher growth in lower margin
consultative services in addition operating contribution margin from
consulting in 1999 declined primarily from lower margin acquisitions

    costs and expenses excluding acquisitionrelated and other charges
increased to 5790 million in 1999 from 4906 million in 1998 and increased
slightly as a percentage of total revenue to 79 in 1999 from 76 in 1998 cost
of services and product development expenses were 2936 million and 2479
million for 1999 and 1998 respectively this increase over the prior fiscal
year reflected the additional support required for the growing client base
costs associated with acquired businesses and continued product development
costs the increase in cost of services and product development expenses as a
percentage of total revenues was primarily attributable to increasing pricing
pressure in research products continuing growth in personnel costs associated
with the development of new products and services and the delivery of products
and services to broader markets

    selling general and administrative expenses increased to 2537 million
from 2154 million for fiscal 1999 and 1998 respectively due to the companys
continuing expansion of worldwide distribution channels and the resulting
commissions earned on the revenue generated although the company added general
and administrative resources to support the growing revenue base selling
general and administrative expenses increased slightly as a percentage of total
revenue to 35 from 34 for fiscal 1999 and 1998 respectively costs and
expenses in fiscal 2000 were anticipated to be impacted both by the remaining
amounts earned by employees under the companys retention incentive program as
well as the fiscal 2000 performancerelated variable compensation expense
expected to be incurred

    other charges in fiscal 1999 consisted of 92 million in legal and advisory
fees related to the recapitalization see note 15recapitalization in the notes
to consolidated financial statements and 142 million of costs primarily
severance related incurred as part of strategic reduction in workforce
initiatives costs and expenses were favorably impacted in 1999 through the
elimination of variable costs linked to financial performance

    depreciation expense increased to 216 million in fiscal 1999 from 179
million in fiscal 1998 primarily due to capital spending required to support
business growth additionally amortization of intangibles increased by 07
million in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998 reflecting primarily goodwill
associated with fiscal 1999 and 1998 acquisitions

    interest income and other decreased slightly to 87 million in fiscal 1999
versus 91 million for fiscal 1998 due principally to the sale of cash
equivalents and marketable securities to fund the recapitalization and working
capital requirements interest expense increased to 13 million due to debt
facility borrowings of 250 million

    provision for income taxes decreased by 19 or 118 million to 510
million in 1999 from 628 million in 1998 the effective tax rate was 37 and
42 for 1999 and 1998 respectively in 1999 the company incurred 86 million
of nondeductible recapitalization costs during the year the tax effect of
which was partially offset by a onetime income tax benefit of 25 million
related primarily to the settlement of certain tax examinations in the second
quarter absent nondeductible costs the onetime income tax benefit and
additional taxes incurred in fiscal 1998 related to the sale of gartnerlearning
the effective rate was 37 for 1999 and

page   12
39 for 1998 the decrease of two percentage points was achieved primarily
through the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards and ongoing tax
planning initiatives a more detailed analysis of the changes in the provision
for income taxes is provided in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial
statements

segment analysis
the company evaluates reportable segment performance and allocates resources
based on gross contribution margin gross contribution is the profit or loss
from operations before interest income and expense certain selling general and
administrative expenses amortization income taxes other charges and foreign
exchange gains and losses

research
research revenues grew 11 to 4790 million as compared to 4331 million in
the prior fiscal year due to increased sales penetration into new and existing
clients and the full year impact of prior fiscal year acquisitions research
gross contribution increased by 8 to 3369 million in fiscal 1999 from 3129
million in fiscal 1998 partially due to incremental revenues from current and
prior year acquisitions gross contribution margin however decreased to 70 in
1999 from 72 in fiscal 1998 as a result of the impact of increased staffing and
acquisition related integration costs

consulting
consulting revenues grew 35 to 1498 million as compared to 1110
million in the prior fiscal year due to increase demand for consulting the
contribution of fiscal 1999 acquisitions consulting gross contribution
increased by 10 to 559 million in fiscal 1999 from 508 million in fiscal
1998 and gross contribution margin decreased to 37 in fiscal 1999 due to the
impact of integration costs and lower margins associated with recent consulting
related acquisitions

events
events revenues grew 54 to 756 million as compared to 491 million in the
prior fiscal year revenue growth was due to increasing attendance at existing
and new events sponsorships and exhibit revenues growth and the impact of
recent event related acquisitions events gross contribution increased
by 66 to 325 million in fiscal 1999 from 195 million in fiscal 1998 with
gross contribution margins increasing to 43 in fiscal 1999 from 40 in fiscal
1998 the increase in events gross contribution margin was due to revenue growth
and the ability of the company to leverage existing event infrastructure

liquidity and capital resources

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2000 was 756 million
compared to 1439 million in the prior fiscal year resulting primarily from
the impact of the decrease in net income the increase in depreciation and
amortization the net gain on sale of investments the change in deferred tax
benefit and the changes in balance sheet accounts particularly fees receivable
deferred revenues accounts payable and accrued liabilities cash provided by
operating activities include a 42 million credit to additional paidin capital
for tax benefits received from stock transactions with employees the tax
benefit of stock transactions with employees is due to a reduction in the
corporate income tax liability based on an imputed compensation deduction equal
to employees gain upon the exercise of stock options at an exercise price below
fair market value

    cash used for investing activities totaled 1000 million for fiscal 2000
compared to 11 million provided by investing activities in fiscal 1999 due to
the effect of cash used for property and equipment additions of 559 million
and business acquisitions and investments of 1356 million partially offset by
proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments of 555 million
and 360 million respectively during fiscal 2000 the company used 1152
million in cash for acquisitions primarily for the purchase of techrepublic
inc for 785 million computer financial consultants limited for 160 million
and rendall and associates inc for 120 million

    cash provided by financing activities totaled 10 million in fiscal 2000
compared to 2138 million used for financing activities in fiscal 1999 the
cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the 4200 million
in borrowings under the credit agreement and issuance of the convertible notes
see note 9longterm debt in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements offset by repayments of 3700 million of credit agreement
borrowings additionally the company paid 499 million for the repurchase of
2493500 shares of class a common stock and 2006700 shares of class b common
stock under the terms of the recapitalization as well as 82 million for the
settlement of a forward purchase agreement on the companys common stock cash
provided by financing activities also includes 81 million in proceeds from the
issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options

    the effect of exchange rates reduced cash and cash equivalents by 38
million for the year ended september 30 2000 and was due to the strengthening
of the us dollar versus certain foreign currencies in fiscal 1999 the effect
of exchange rates reduced cash and cash equivalents by 01 million at
september 30 2000 cash and cash equivalents totaled 617 million the company
issues letters of credit in the ordinary course of business at september 30
2000 the company had outstanding letters of credit for 15 million with chase
manhattan bank and 20 million with the bank of new york the company believes
that its current cash balances together with cash anticipated to be provided by
operating activities the sale of marketable equity securities and borrowings
available under the

page   13
existing senior revolving credit facility will be sufficient for the expected
shortterm and foreseeable longterm cash needs of the company in the ordinary
course of business including capital commitments related to techrepublic and
the companys remaining obligation to make open market purchases of its common
stock required as part of the recapitalization if the company were to require
substantial amounts of additional capital in the future to pursue business
opportunities that may arise involving substantial investments of additional
capital there can be no assurances that such capital will be available to the
company or will be available on commercially reasonable terms as of september
30 2000 the company has a remaining commitment to purchase an additional
662363 shares of class a common stock and 4128 shares of class b common stock
in the open market by july 2001 the company intends to fund this remaining
commitment through existing cash balances cash proceeds anticipated from the
sale of marketable equity securities cash expected to be provided from
operations or borrowings available under the senior revolving credit facility
the company is subject to certain customary affirmative negative and financial
covenants under the senior revolving credit facility and continued compliance
with these covenants could preclude the company from borrowing the maximum
amount of the credit facility as a result of these covenants the companys
borrowing availability at september 30 2000 is 1219 million of the 2000
million senior revolving credit facility additionally there can be no
assurance that the companys debt service obligations will not have a material
adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial
condition although a default under the terms of the companys credit facility
could result in an acceleration of the companys debt obligations management
believes that such an occurrence is not likely

factors that may affect future results

the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that
involves numerous risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond the
companys control the following section discusses many but not all of these
risks and uncertainties

competitive environment the company faces competition from a significant number
of independent providers of information products and services as well as the
internal marketing and planning organizations of the companys clients the
company also competes indirectly against consulting firms and other information
providers including electronic and print media companies these indirect
competitors could choose to compete directly with the company in the future in
addition limited barriers to entry exist in the companys market as a result
additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to
provide additional or complementary services increased competition may result
in loss of market share diminished value in the companys products and
services reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures the company may
not be successful if it cannot compete effectively on quality of research and
analysis timely delivery of information customer service the ability to offer
products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis and price

hiring and retention of employees the companys future success depends heavily
upon the quality of its senior management sales personnel it analysts
consultants and other key personnel the company faces intense competition for
these qualified professionals from among others technology and internet
companies market research firms consulting firms and electronic and print
media companies some of the personnel that the company attempts to hire are
subject to noncompetition agreements that could impede the companys shortterm
recruitment efforts any failure to retain key personnel or hire additional
qualified personnel as may be required to support the evolving needs of clients
or growth in the companys business could adversely affect the quality of the
companys products and services and therefore its future business and
operating results

maintenance of existing products and services the company operates in a rapidly
evolving market and the companys success depends upon its ability to deliver
high quality and timely research and analysis to its clients and to anticipate
and understand the changing needs of its clients any failure to continue to
provide credible and reliable information that is useful to its clients could
have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results
further if the companys predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated
by appropriate research the companys reputation may suffer and demand for its
products and services may decline

introduction of new products and services the market for the companys products
and services are characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and
analysis to maintain its competitive position the company must continue to
successfully enhance and improve its products and services develop or acquire
new products and services in a timely manner and appropriately position and
price products and services any failure to successfully do so could have a
material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations or
financial position in addition the company must continue to improve its
methods for delivering its products and services for example the company
believes that it needs to continue to invest in and develop its ability to use
the web as a delivery channel for products and services failure to increase and
improve the companys web capabilities could adversely affect the companys
future business and operating results

expanding markets the company has recently begun to expand its product and
service offerings to smaller companies and to different user bases within
existing and potential larger company clients these target market segments are
relatively new to the companys sales and marketing personnel as a result the
company may not be able to compete effectively or generate significant revenues
in these new market segments
page   14
internet business risks the company through techrepublic operates a web site
targeted to it professionals that offers it industry news analysis articles
forums event listings and job peer and vendor directories the majority of
revenues from this business are derived from advertising and subscriptions the
companys ability to continue to achieve and grow significant advertising
revenues depends upon growth of its user base the user base being attractive to
advertisers the ability to derive demographic and other information from users
and acceptance by advertisers of the web as an advertising medium similarly
the companys ability to generate significant subscription revenues depends on
its ability to continue to develop content and services that are attractive to
its user base if the company was unable to successfully adapt to the needs of
its users and advertisers the companys internet business would be materially
and adversely affected

international operations a substantial portion of the companys revenues are
derived from international sales as a result the companys operating results
are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities
including general political and economic conditions in each country changes in
market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations and tariffs challenges
in staffing and managing foreign operations changes in regulatory requirements
compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations different or overlapping
tax structures higher levels of united states taxation on foreign income and
the difficulty of enforcing client agreements and protecting intellectual
property rights in international jurisdictions additionally the company relies
on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations if any of
these arrangements are terminated the company may not be able to replace the
terminated arrangement on equally beneficial terms or on a timely basis or
clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do
business with the company or its new agent

branding the company believes that its gartner brand is critical to the
companys efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand
recognition will increase as competition increases the company expects to
expand its marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and
may need to increase its marketing budget hire additional marketing and public
relations personnel expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise
increase expenditures to create and maintain brand loyalty among clients if the
company fails to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand or incurs
excessive expenses in attempting to do so the companys future business and
operating results could be materially and adversely impacted

investment activities the company maintains investments in equity securities in
private and publicly traded companies through direct ownership and through
wholly and partially owned venture capital funds the companies invested in are
primarily early to midstage itbased and internetenabled businesses it is the
companys objective to seek financial returns from these investments as an
additional source of capital to fund strategic initiatives the risks related to
such investments due to their nature and the volatile public markets include
the possibilities that anticipated returns may not materialize or could be
significantly delayed as a result the companys financial results could be
materially impacted

significant indebtedness in connection with its recapitalization transactions
see note 15recapitalization in the notes to consolidated financial
statements and strategic repositioning which include the purchase and
continued investment in techrepublic the company has incurred significant
indebtedness the associated debt service could impair future operating results
further the outstanding debt could limit the amount of cash or additional
credit available to the company which in turn could restrain the companys
ability to expand or enhance products and services respond to competitive
pressures or pursue business opportunities that may arise in the future and
involve substantial investments of additional capital in addition the
convertible notes issued by the company see note 9longterm debt in the notes
to consolidated financial statements contain a reset provision allowing in
fiscal 2001 for the possible reduction of the conversion price under certain
conditions if the company did not elect to redeem the convertible notes in the
event of a reset the impact of a reduction in the conversion price would result
in additional shares of common stock being issued compared to the amount that
would be issued based on the original conversion price if the notes are
ultimately converted into shares correspondingly if the company elected to
redeem the convertible notes in the event of a reset there can be no assurances
that the capital required to be raised would be available on commercially
reasonable or comparable terms which in turn could impact future business and
operating results

organizational and product integration related to acquisitions the company has
made and expects to continue to make acquisitions of or significant investments
in businesses that offer complementary products and services the risks
involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying
more than the value the company derives from the acquisition the assumption of
undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks the difficulty of
integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business the ability
to retain key personnel of the acquired company the time to train the sales
force to market and sell the products of the acquired company the potential
disruption of the companys ongoing business and the distraction of management
from the companys business the company may also incur additional debt or issue
equity securities to pay for future acquisitions

enforcement of the companys intellectual rights the company relies on a
combination of copyright patent trademark trade secrets confidentiality
procedures and contractual procedures to protect its intellectual property
rights despite the companys efforts to protect its intellectual property
rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to obtain and use
technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary in
addition the companys intellectual property rights may not survive a legal
challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for the company
furthermore the laws of certain countries do not protect the companys
page   15
proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states
accordingly the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property
against unauthorized third party copying or use which could adversely affect
the companys competitive position

agreements with ims health incorporated in connection with its
recapitalization the company agreed to certain restrictions on business
activity to reduce the risk to ims health and its stockholders of substantial
tax liabilities associated with the spinoff by ims health of its equity interest
in the company the company also agreed to assume the risk of such tax
liabilities if the company were to undertake certain business activities that
give rise to the liabilities as a result the company may be limited in its
ability to undertake acquisitions involving the issuance of a significant amount
of stock unless the company were to seek and obtain a ruling from the irs that
the transaction will not give rise to such tax liabilities in addition the
company has certain limits in purchasing its common stock under the terms of the
recapitalization

possibility of infringement claims third parties may assert infringement claims
against the company in the future regardless of the merits responding to any
such claim could be time consuming result in costly litigation and require the
company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered
or available on terms acceptable to the company if a successful claim is made
against the company and the company fails to develop or license a substitute
technology the companys business results of operations or financial position
could be materially adversely affected

potential fluctuations in operating results the companys quarterly operating
income may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors including
the timing of the execution of research contracts the performance of consulting
engagements the timing of symposia and other events the amount of new business
generated by the company the restructuring of the companys sales force and the
change in territories of sales personnel at the end of each fiscal year the mix
of domestic and international business changes in market demand for the
companys products and services the timing of the development introductions
and marketing of new products and services the results of operations of
techrepublic and competition in the industry as a result the companys
operating results in any quarter are not necessarily a good predictor of its
operating results for any future period

euro conversion

on january 1 1999 eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union
established fixed conversion rates between their sovereign currencies and a new
currency called the euro and adopted the euro as their common legal currency
in 2002 participating countries will adopt the euro as their single currency
beginning that date the participating countries will issue new eurodenominated
bills and coins for use in cash transactions legacy currency will no longer be
legal tender for any transactions beginning july 1 2002 making conversion to
the euro complete as of september 30 2000 the company has not found the
impact of the adoption of the euro to have an impact on the competitive
conditions in european markets and does not believe that the translation of
financial transactions into euros has had or will have a significant effect on
the companys results of operations liquidity or financial condition
additionally the company does not anticipate any material impact from the euro
conversion on the companys financial information systems which currently
accommodate multiple currencies costs associated with the adoption of the euro
have not been and are not expected to be significant and are being expensed as
incurred

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to borrowing under longterm debt which consists of an unsecured
senior revolving credit facility with the chase manhattan bank and 3000
million of 6 convertible subordinated notes see note 9  longterm debt in
the notes to consolidated financial statements at september 30 2000 there
were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility under the
revolving credit facility the interest rate on borrowings is based on libor plus
an additional 100 to 200 basis points based on the companys debt to ebitda
ratio the company believes that an increase or decrease of 10 in the effective
interest rate on available borrowings from its senior revolving credit facility
if fully utilized will not have a material effect on future results of
operations the company believes that it is not practical to determine changes
in fair value due to market risk exposure its convertible subordinated
notes given the numerous features that are unique to these notes however the
convertible subordinated notes contain a reset provision allowing in april 2001
for the possible reduction of the conversion price per share if the market price
of the companys class a common stock is less than the initial conversion price
if on the first anniversary of the notes issuance april 17 2001 the note
holder is able to and resets the conversion price and the company elects not
to redeem the notes the note holder would ultimately be able to convert the
notes in 2003 into additional shares of class a common stock compared to the
number of  shares that could have been converted based on the initial
conversion price

in addition the company is exposed to market risk from a series of forward
purchase agreements on its class a common stock beginning in 1997 the company
entered into a series of forward purchase agreements that extend through may
2003 to offset the dilutive effect of the companys stockbased employee
compensation plans these agreements are settled quarterly on a net basis in
either shares of the companys class a common stock or cash at the companys
option during the year ended september 30 2000 four settlements resulted in
the company receiving 155792 shares of class a common stock and paying
approximately 82 million in cash the market price of the companys class a
common stock declined approximately 27 during fiscal 2000 resulting in the cash
settlements paid future settlements are dependent upon the market price of the
companys class a common stock as of september 30 2000 a forward purchase
agreement in place covered approximately 93 million or 672365 shares of class
a common stock having a forward purchase price established at 1381 per share
if the market priced portion of this agreement was settled based on the
september 30 2000 market price of class a common stock of 1163 per share the
company would settle under the terms of the forward purchase agreement with a
payment of either 15 million in cash or 126316 shares of class a common
stock as of september 30 2000 a one dollar increase or decrease in the market
price of the companys class a common stock would increase or decrease the
settlement value of the forward purchase agreement by 07 million

    pursuant to the terms of the companys recapitalization as of september 30
2000 the company had a remaining commitment to purchase an additional 662363
shares of class a common stock and 4128 shares of class b common stock in the
open market by july 2001 with a combined value of 77 million the total cost
of the remaining commitment is subject to the risk that the market price of the
companys common stock will increase the company intends to fund this remaining
commitment through existing cash balances cash proceeds anticipated from the
sale of marketable equity securities cash expected to be provided from
operations or borrowings available under the senior revolving credit facility

    the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market
value of its equity investments the company invests in equity securities of
public companies directly and through si venture associates llc si i a
wholly owned affiliate and si venture fund ii lp si ii the company owns
34 of si ii si i and si ii are engaged in making venture capital investments

investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of
september 30 2000 the company had equity securities totaling 538 million
including available for sale investments with a fair market value of 354
million and a cost basis of 142 million the gross unrealized gains of 213
million and gross unrealized losses of 01 million have been recorded net of
deferred taxes of 121 million as a separate component of
page   17
accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of
the consolidated balance sheets these investments are inherently risky as the
businesses are typically in early development stages and may never develop
furthermore certain of these investments are in publiclytraded companies whose
shares are subject to significant market price volatility adverse changes in
market conditions and poor operating results of the underlying investments may
result in the company incurring losses or an inability to recover the original
carrying value of its investments the company does not attempt to reduce or
eliminate its market exposure on its investments in equity securities and may
incur losses related to these investments

amounts invested in the companys foreign operations are translated into us
dollars at the exchange rates in effect at september 30 2000 the resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of the
consolidated balance sheets the companys foreign subsidiaries generally
collect revenues and pay expenses in foreign currencies other than the united
states dollar since the functional currency of the companys foreign operations
is the local currency foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as
a component of stockholders equity and do not impact operating results
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower
revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens
against other currencies therefore changes in exchange rates may negatively
affect the companys consolidated revenues as expressed in us dollars and
expenses from foreign operations currency transaction gains or losses arising
from transactions of the company in currencies other than the functional
currency are included in results of operations to date the company has not
entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative
financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates

revenue and commission expense recognition revenue from research products is
deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term consulting revenues
primarily derived from consulting and measurement engagements are recognized as
work is performed on a contract by contract basis events revenue is deferred
and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium exposition or
conference in addition the company defers certain costs directly related to
events and expenses these costs into the period during which the related
symposium exhibition and conference occurs the companys policy is to defer
only those costs primarily prepaid site and production services costs that are
incremental and are directly attributable to a specific event other costs of
organizing and producing the companys events primarily company personnel and
nonevent specific expenses are expensed in the period incurred at the end of
each fiscal quarter management assesses on an eventbyevent basis whether
expected direct costs of producing a scheduled event will exceed expected
revenues if such costs are expected to exceed revenues the company records the
expected loss in the period determined other revenues includes software
licensing fees which are recognized when delivery has occurred and when
collectibility is probable and the fees are fixed or determinable as well as
web based advertising revenues web based advertising revenues are derived from
shortterm contracts in which the customer is guaranteed a minimum number of
impressions ie a oneonone view of an advertisement by the end user for a
fixed fee revenues from advertising are recognized as the impressions are
delivered all research and measurement contracts are billable upon signing
absent special terms granted on a limited basis in accordance with the contract
terms the company records at the time of signing of a research and measurement
contract the entire amount of the contract billable as a fee receivable which
represents a legally enforceable claim and a corresponding amount as deferred
revenue all research and measurement contracts are noncancelable and
nonrefundable except for government contracts which have a 30day
cancellation clause government contracts have not produced material
cancellations to date the company also records the related commission
obligation upon the signing of the contract and amortizes the corresponding
deferred commission expense over the contract period in which the related
revenues are earned and amortized to income

cash and cash equivalents marketable securities that mature within three months
of purchase are considered cash equivalents investments with maturities of more
than three months are classified as marketable securities during the year ended
september 30 1999 the company sold all debt securities with maturities of more
than three months at the amortized cost of 432 million to finance a portion of
the companys recapitalization see note 15recapitalization

publicly traded equity securities under statement of financial accounting
standards no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity
securities fas 115 in accordance with fas 115 unrealized gains on
marketable investments are classified as availableforsale securities and are
carried net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets investments
that are not publicly traded are carried at cost a decline in the market value
of an availableforsale investment below cost deemed to be other than temporary
results in a reduction in the carrying value amount to fair value the
impairment would be charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security
established the cost of equity securities sold is based on specific
identification publicly traded equity securities that are expected to be sold
within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as marketable equity
securities on the consolidated balance sheets all other investments are
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets

property equipment and leasehold improvements property equipment and
leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization property and equipment are depreciated using the straightline
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the related leases

impairment of longlived assets and intangible assets the company reviews
longlived assets and intangible assets for impairment based upon a number of
factors including operating results business plans budgets economic
projections and changes in


                                      f9
page   30
managements strategic direction managements policy regarding longlived
assets and intangible assets is to evaluate the recoverability of these assets
by determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its
remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows
of the acquired operation should events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable based on undiscounted future operating
cash flows an impairment loss would be recognized by the company the amount of
goodwill impairment if any is measured based on the difference between
projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate
reflecting the companys average cost of funds and the carrying value of the
goodwill

software development costs the company capitalizes certain computer software
development costs and enhancements upon the establishment of technological
feasibility limited to the net realizable value of the software product and
ceases when the software product is available for general release to clients
until these products reach technological feasibility all costs related to
development efforts are charged to expense once technological feasibility has
been determined additional costs incurred in development including coding
testing and documentation are capitalized amortization of software
development costs is provided on a productbyproduct basis over the estimated
economic life of the software generally two years using the straightline
method amortization of capitalized computer software development costs begins
when the products are available for general release to customers additionally
the company capitalizes certain costs that are incurred to purchase or to create
and implement internal use software the company performs periodic reviews to
ensure that unamortized capitalized software development costs remain
recoverable from future revenue

intangible assets intangible assets include goodwill noncompete agreements
tradenames and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the tangible and
identifiable intangible net assets acquired amortization is recorded using the
straightline method over periods ranging from three to thirty years
noncompete agreements are being amortized on a straightline basis over the
period of the agreement ranging from two to five years tradenames are being
amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging
from nine to twelve years

foreign currency translation all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
are translated into us dollars at fiscal yearend exchange rates income and
expense items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the
year the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
stockholders equity currency transaction gains or losses arising from
transactions of the company in currencies other that the functional currency are
included in results of operations

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on
differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using
presently enacted tax rates the provision for income taxes is the sum of the
amount of income tax paid or payable for the year as determined by applying the
provisions of enacted tax laws to taxable income for that year and the net
changes during the year in the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities
undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us amounted to
approximately 330 million as of september 30 2000 and will either be
indefinitely reinvested or remitted substantially free of us tax accordingly
no material provision has been made for taxes that may be payable upon
remittance of such earnings nor is it practicable to determine the amount of
this liability the company credits additional paidin capital for realized tax
benefits arising from stock transactions with employees the tax benefit on a
nonqualified stock option is equal to the tax effect of the difference between
the market price of a share of the companys common stock on the exercise and
grant dates

fair value of financial instruments the companys financial instruments include
cash trade receivables and payables and accruals which are shortterm in
nature accordingly the carrying amounts of these financial instruments
approximate their fair value see note 11 regarding forward purchase
agreements investments in publicly traded equity securities are valued based
on quoted market prices investments in equity securities that are not publicly
traded are valued at cost which approximates fair market value

longterm debt consists of a senior revolving credit facility and 3000 million
of 6 convertible subordinated notes see note 9  longterm debt the
carrying amount of longterm debt under the senior revolving credit facility
approximates fair value as the rates of interest on the revolving credit
facility approximate current market rates of interest for similar instruments
with comparable maturities at september 30 2000 there were no amounts
outstanding under the revolving credit facility the company believes that it is
not practical to estimate a fair value different from the carrying face value of
the convertible subordinated notes given the numerous features that are unique
to these convertible notes

concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject
the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and fees
receivable concentrations of credit risk with respect to fees receivable are
limited due to the large number of clients comprising the companys client base
and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and
disclosures if any of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates
estimates are used when accounting for such items as allowance for doubtful
accounts depreciation amortization income taxes and certain accrued
liabilities

basic earnings per share eps is computed by dividing earnings available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period diluted eps reflects the potential dilution of securities that
could share in earnings including stock options restricted stock awards and
warrants when the effect of stock options and restricted stock awards is
antidilutive they are excluded from the calculation

     the following table sets forth the required disclosures of the
reconciliation of the basic and diluted net earnings per share computations

1999 and was funded out of existing cash also in connection with the companys
recapitalization the company agreed to purchase on the open market by july 2001
an aggregate of 5166691 shares allocated between class a common stock and
class b common stock in the same proportion as the ratio of the number of shares
of each class outstanding on that date

     under the terms of the recapitalization agreement the company is required
to indemnify ims health for additional taxes under certain circumstances if
actions by the company cause the distribution to become taxable to ims health
and its stockholders these actions include the use of stock for substantial
acquisitions and the issuance without regulatory approval of stock options
over set limitations during a twoyear period following the recapitalization in
addition the company has indemnified ims health for any tax liabilities
associated with the spinoff that may result from the acquisition of the company
the company monitors its actions for compliance in this regard and believes that
it is unlikely within matters under the companys control that it will incur
any significant costs as a result of its indemnity

note 16  segment information

the company manages its business in four reportable segments organized on the
basis of differences in its related products and services research consulting
events and techrepublic research consists primarily of subscriptionbased
research products consulting consists primarily of consulting and measurement
engagements events consist of various symposia expositions and conferences
techrepublic consists of an it professional online destination with revenues
consisting primarily of web based advertising

     the company evaluates reportable segment performance and allocates
resources based on gross contribution margin gross contribution as presented
below is the profit or loss from operations before interest income and expense
certain selling general and administrative costs amortization income taxes
other charges and foreign exchange gains and losses the accounting policies
used by the reportable segments are the same as those used by the company

     the company earns revenue from clients in many countries other than the
united states the companys country of domicile there is no individual country
in which revenues from external clients represent 10 or more of the companys
consolidated revenues additionally no single client accounted for 10 or more
of total revenue and the loss of a single client in managements opinion would
not have a material adverse effect on revenues

     the company does not identify or allocate assets including capital
expenditures by operating segment with the exception of techrepublic
accordingly assets are not being reported by segment other than techrepublic
because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the
evaluation of performance or making decisions in the allocation of resources at
september 30 2000 techrepublic had identifiable tangible assets of 75
million for the year ended september 30 2000 techrepublic had capital
expenditures totaling 16 million and depreciation and amortization expense of
153 million

     the following tables present information about reportable segments in
thousands the other column includes certain revenues and corporate and other
expenses primarily selling general and administrative unallocated to
reportable segments expenses allocated to operations that do not meet the
segment reporting quantitative threshold and other charges there are no
intersegment revenues

1 represents the sum of other and learning revenues and gross contributions
    respectively for the fiscal year ended september 301998

     the companys consolidated revenues are generated primarily through direct
sales to clients by domestic and international sales forces and a network of
independent international distributors the company defines europe revenues as
revenues attributable to clients located in england and the european region and
other international revenues as revenues attributable to all areas located
outside of the united states canada and europe most products and services of
the company are provided on an integrated worldwide basis because of the
integration of products and services delivery it is not practical to separate
precisely the revenues and operating income of the company by geographic
location accordingly the separation set forth in the table below is based upon
internal allocations which involve certain management estimates and judgments

     european identifiable tangible assets consist primarily of the assets of
the european subsidiaries and include the accounts receivable balances carried
directly by the subsidiaries located in england france and germany all other
european customer receivables are maintained by and therefore are included as
identifiable assets of the united states operations

     summarized information by geographic location is as follows in thousands
